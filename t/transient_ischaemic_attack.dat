5000|$|Amaurosis fugax (Latin: fugax meaning fleeting) is a {{temporary}} loss of vision in one eye caused by decreased blood flow (ischemia) to the retina. It may also be caused by embolization from atherosclerotic plaques in the ipsilateral (same side) internal carotid artery. It {{is a type of}} <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (TIA). Those experiencing amaurosis usually experience complete symptom resolution within a few minutes. In a small minority of those who experience amaurosis, stroke or permanent vision loss results. Diabetes, hypertension and smoking are factors known to increase the risks of suffering this condition. It also can be the result of surgical repair to the mitral valve, when very small emboli may break away from the site of the repair, while the patient's tissue grows to cover the plastic annuloplasty band.|$|E
5000|$|People {{diagnosed}} with TIA are sometimes {{said to have}} had a warning for an approaching stroke. If the time period of blood supply impairment lasts more than a few minutes, the nerve cells of that area of the brain die and cause permanent neurologic damage. One-third of the people with TIA later have recurrent TIAs and one-third have a stroke because of permanent nerve cell loss. Other sources cite that 10% of TIAs will develop a stroke within 90 days, half of which will occur in the first two days following the TIA.The risk of a stroke occurring after a TIA can be predicted using the ABCD² score. However the ABCD² score ironically does not reliably predict the level of carotid artery stenosis (thought to be a major cause of stroke)in TIA patients. Instead, a person's age is more reliable in predicting any level of carotid stenosis in either symptomatic or asymptomatic side in <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack.</b> [...] Response to aspirin treatment and prognosis in people with TIA could be predicted using emerging new blood tests.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbout 20 % of {{patients}} with ischaemic stroke have a preceding <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack,</b> which is clinically defined as focal neurological symptoms of ischaemic origin resolving spontaneously. Failure to diagnose <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> is a wasted opportunity to prevent recurrent disabling stroke. Unfortunately, diagnosis can be difficult, due to numerous mimics, and {{to the absence of}} a specific test. New diagnostic tools are thus needed, in particular for radiologically silent cases, which correspond to the recommended tissue-based definition of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack.</b> As endothelial activation is a hallmark of cerebrovascular events, we postulated that this may also be true for <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack,</b> {{and that it would be}} clinically relevant to develop non-invasive in vivo imaging to detect this endothelial activation. Using transcriptional and immunohistological analyses for adhesion molecules in a mouse model, we identified brain endothelial P-selectin as a potential biomarker for <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack.</b> We thus developed ultra-sensitive molecular magnetic resonance imaging using antibody-based microparticles of iron oxide targeting P-selectin. This highly sensitive imaging strategy unmasked activated endothelial cells after experimental transient ischae-mic attack and allowed discriminating <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> from epilepsy and migraine, two important <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> mimics. We provide preclinical evidence that combining conventional magnetic resonance imaging with molecular magnetic resonance imaging targeting P-selectin might aid in the diagnosis of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aim.   This {{paper is}} a report of a study of how people’s {{experiences}} of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> affect their perception of their health and their uptake of health maintenance measures. Background.   <b>Transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> is a well-recognized warning sign of subsequent stroke, but early diagnosis and management of risk factors can substantially reduce this risk. Even though the physical effects of a <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> are transient, it is known to negatively affect quality of life. However, no qualitative studies have explored the impact of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> on people’s everyday lives. Methods.   Sixteen participants were recruited from a vascular surgery clinic in a district general hospital in North West England. All had a recent <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack.</b> A qualitative grounded theory study using detailed interviews (n = 21) was conducted. Findings.   Participants experienced conflict between acknowledgement of the <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> as a significant illness episode with implications for their long-term health, and denial of its seriousness. Although they often ignored the initial signs, participants also experienced fear due to increased awareness of their risk of stroke. Often, they {{believed that they were}} having a permanent stroke. Many participants were prompted to seek medical advice by a family member or acquaintance. Having a <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> negatively changed their perception of their health and their quality of life, but some also viewed it as a positive event that had warned of their stroke risk and enabled them to take up health maintenance measures. Conclusions.   Having a <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> permanently changes people’s quality of life and their perception of their health, despite the transience of the symptoms. The ability of people to make positive health changes after a <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> to some extent ameliorates the negative effects of being aware of their heightened stroke risk. Their appreciation of their quality of life may also be enhanced. The transience of the symptoms and lack of knowledge of transient ischaemic attacks lead to delays in seeking medical advice...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Identification of {{patients}} {{at highest risk}} of early stroke after <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> has been improved with imaging based scores. We aimed to compare the validity and prognostic utility of imaging-based stroke risk scores in patients after <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack.</b> METHODS: We did a pooled analysis of published and unpublished individual-patient data from 16 cohort studies of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> done in Asia, Europe, and the USA, with early brain and vascular imaging and follow up. All patients were assessed by stroke specialists in hospital settings as inpatients, in emergency departments, or in <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> clinics. Inclusion criteria were stroke-specialist confirmed <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack,</b> age of 18 years or older, and MRI done within 7 days of index <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and before stroke recurrence. Multivariable logistic regression was done to analyse the predictive utility of abnormal diffusion-weighted MRI, carotid stenosis, and <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> within 1 week of index <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (dual <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack)</b> after adjusting for ABCD 2 score. We compared the prognostic utility of the ABCD 2, ABCD 2 -I, and ABCD 3 -I scores using discrimination, calibration, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS: In 2176 patients from 16 cohort studies done between 2005 and 2015, after adjusting for ABCD 2 score, positive diffusion-weighted imaging (odds ratio [OR] 3 · 8, 95 % CI 2 · 1 - 7 · 0), dual <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (OR 3 · 3, 95 % CI 1 · 8 - 5 · 8), and ipsilateral carotid stenosis (OR 4 · 7, 95 % CI 2 · 6 - 8 · 6) were associated with 7 day stroke after index <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (p< 0 · 001 for all). 7 day stroke risk increased with increasing ABCD 2 -I and ABCD 3 -I scores (both p< 0 · 001). Discrimination to identify early stroke risk was improved for ABCD 2 -I versus ABCD 2 (2 day c statistic 0 · 74 vs 0 · 64; p= 0 · 006). However, discrimination was further improved by ABCD 3 -I compared with ABCD 2 (2 day c statistic 0 · 84 vs 0 · 64; p< 0 · 001) and ABCD 2 -I (c statistic 0 · 84 vs 0 · 74; p< 0 · 001). Early stroke risk reclassification was improved by ABCD 3 -I compared with ABCD 2 -I score (clinical net reclassification improvement 33 % at 2 days). INTERPRETATION: Although ABCD 2 -I and ABCD 3 -I showed validity, the ABCD 3 -I score reliably identified highest-risk patients at highest risk of a stroke after <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> with improved risk prediction compared with ABCD 2 -I. <b>Transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> management guided by ABCD 3 -I with immediate stroke-specialist assessment, urgent MRI, and vascular imaging should now be considered, with monitoring of safety and cost-effectiveness.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) <b>Transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> {{and minor}} stroke are medical {{emergencies}} and significant warning signs for stroke. To date, {{much of the}} research attention has been focused on identifying the most beneficial pathway of healthcare for people with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or minor stroke. Yet, {{little is known about the}} lived experiences of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and minor stroke or how these experiences are shaped by health services. In this thesis, a narrative inquiry was undertaken to explore the experiences of twelve individuals with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or minor stroke. Data was collected in one, face-to-face, semi-structured interview. To analyse the participant stories, an extension of the narrative inquiry methodology was developed that explores both individual experiences and the commonalities between experiences within the temporal, social, and place domains of narrative inquiry. Through their stories of experience, novel insights were revealed including an altered perception of time, the roles of others in help-seeking, and the impact of living with a disrupted body. Furthermore, exploring their experiences led to the recognition of a grieving process and the development of a new model of grief that perceives grief in liminal spaces. Healthcare pathways also shaped participant experiences of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and minor stroke through their current and past interactions. Thus, every interaction with healthcare services informed their future decisions and behaviours. Importantly, exploring these interactions led to my discovery of a new theory of help-seeking behaviour that explains why some individuals seek help while others do not. In this thesis, the stories of twelve individuals with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and minor stroke, and the commonalities between their stories, are explored, relived and retold. In doing so, the intricacy and complexity of their <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and minor stroke experiences are revealed...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{investigating}} the neuropsychological sequelae of transient ischaemic attacks. Transient ischaemic attacks {{are defined as}} those neurological disorders {{in which there is}} complete resolution of neurological symptoms within twenty·four hours. Transient ischaemic attacks may or may not reveal evidence of brain infarcts on imaging studies. In the present study, the neuropsychological sequelae of transient ischaemic attacks in the carotid circulation were investigated since, within the perspective of cognitive neuropsychology, it was assumed that localized changes in cognitive functions could be demonstrated. Since several psychological, medical and neurological factors are known to influence scores·on neuropsychological tests, regression analyses were performed to determine which factors contributed significantly to the variance of scores on neuropsychological tests in the <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and control groups. Two <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> groups, each comprising forty left and forty right hemisphere involvement patients, were then compared {{with each other and with}} a control group of forty general medical patients. Stenosis of the carotid artery formed a significant predictor of test scores in the combined <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> group. When the groups were·analyzed independently, in the left <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> group stenosis predicted performance on the same tests reaching significance for the combined group, and for the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Perseverative Score). In the right <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> group, stenosis significantly predicted performance on Digits Forward, Backward and Total, the PASAT (2. 4 seconds) and Trails B. On the other hand, education formed a significant predictor of performance on Digits Forward, Digits Backward and Digits Total and the PASAT (all levels) in the control group. Multivariate comparisons revealed that the left and right <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> groups performed worse than the controls on tests of attention, concentration and conceptual flexibi 1 ity. The left <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> group performed worse than the right <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> group on all tests of attention and concentration, but there was a significantly better performance of the former group on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Trial 1), Block Designs and Verbal Fluency. The findings on the PASAT that left <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> patients performed significantly worse than the right hemisphere group ·were considered to be relatively unreported previously in the literature on transient ischaemic attacks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} any underinvestigation of older patients with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (TIA) and stroke. DESIGN: Comparative population based studies. SETTING: Routine clinical practice in all secondary care services in Oxfordshire and a nested population based study of incidence of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> and stroke (the Oxford vascular study-OXVASC). PARTICIPANTS/POPULATION: All patients undergoing carotid imaging for ischaemic retinal or cerebral <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2005 in the Oxford vascular study (n = 91, 105) and from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 in routine clinical practice (n = 589, 899). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age specific rates of carotid imaging, diagnosed >or= 50 % symptomatic carotid stenosis, and subsequent endarterectomy, {{in patients with}} recent <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke. RESULTS: Of patients with recent carotid territory <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or ischaemic stroke, 575 in routine clinical practice and 402 in the Oxford vascular study had carotid imaging, with similar rates up {{to the age of}} 80. The incidence of >or= 50 % symptomatic stenosis increased steeply with age, particularly in those aged >or= 80. Compared with investigations in patients in the Oxford vascular study, the rates of carotid imaging (relative rate 0. 36, 95 % confidence interval 0. 28 to 0. 46, P or= 50 % symptomatic stenosis (0. 33, 0. 16 to 0. 69, P = 0. 004), and carotid endarterectomy (0. 19, 0. 06 to 0. 63, P = 0. 007) in this age group in routine clinical practice were all substantially lower. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of symptomatic carotid stenosis increases steeply with age, but, despite good evidence of major benefit from endarterectomy in elderly patients and a willingness to have surgery, there is substantial underinvestigation in routine clinical practice in patients aged >or= 80 with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or ischaemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The ABCD² score {{improves}} stratification {{of patients}} with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> by early stroke risk. We aimed to develop two new versions of the score: one {{that was based on}} preclinical information and one that was based on imaging and other secondary care assessments. METHODS: We analysed pooled data from patients with clinically defined <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> who were investigated while in secondary care. Items that contribute to the ABCD² score (age, blood pressure, clinical weakness, duration, and diabetes), other clinical variables, carotid stenosis, and abnormal acute diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were recorded and were included in multivariate logistic regression analysis of stroke occurrence at early time intervals after onset of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack.</b> Scores based on the findings of this analysis were validated in patients with <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> from two independent population-based cohorts. FINDINGS: 3886 patients were included in the study: 2654 in the derivation sample and 1232 in the validation sample. We derived the ABCD³ score (range 0 - 9 points) by assigning 2 points for dual <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (an earlier <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> within 7 days of the index event). C statistics (which indicate discrimination better than chance at > 0 · 5) for the ABCD³ score were 0 · 78 at 2 days, 0 · 80 at 7 days, 0 · 79 at 28 days, and 0 · 77 at 90 days, compared with C statistics for the ABCD² score of 0 · 71 at 2 days (p= 0 · 083), 0 · 71 at 7 days (p= 0 · 012), 0 · 71 at 28 days (p= 0 · 021), and 0 · 69 at 90 days (p= 0 · 018). We included stenosis of at least 50 % on carotid imaging (2 points) and abnormal DWI (2 points) in the ABCD³-imaging (ABCD³-I) score (0 - 13 points). C statistics for the ABCD³-I score were 0 · 90 at 2 days (compared with ABCD² score p= 0 · 035), 0 · 92 at 7 days (p= 0 · 001), 0 · 85 at 28 days (p= 0 · 028), and 0 · 79 at 90 days (p= 0 · 073). The 90 -day net reclassification improvement compared with ABCD² was 29 · 1 % for ABCD³ (p= 0 · 0003) and 39 · 4 % for ABCD³-I (p= 0 · 034). In the validation sample, the ABCD³ and ABCD³-I scores predicted early stroke at 7, 28, and 90 days. However, discrimination and net reclassification {{of patients with}} early stroke were similar with ABCD³ compared with ABCD². INTERPRETATION: The ABCD³-I score can improve risk stratification after <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> in secondary care settings. However, use of ABCD³ cannot be recommended without further validation. FUNDING: Health Research Board of Ireland, Irish Heart Foundation, and Irish National Lottery...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) carried out within three days of a first stroke or <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> of cryptogenic or lacunar type may disclose more thrombi or spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) than previously reported. This finding may help early treatment decisions.  METHODS—Patients aged between 40 and 80 years, admitted for <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> or ischaemic stroke during a 40 month period, were prospectively considered. TOE was carried out within 72 hours of symptom onset with a 5 MHz biplanar transducer. Subjects with recurring events, very severe strokes, large artery obstructions, or obvious cardiac sources of embolism were excluded.  RESULTS—Sixty five patients were studied, 43 with a cryptogenic stroke or <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> (66. 2 %), and 22 with a lacunar stroke (33. 8 %). The mean (SD) interval between symptom onset and TOE was 43. 4 (17. 2) hours for cryptogenic, and 48. 5 (19. 5) hours for lacunar patients. Atrial thrombi were found in one patient with a cryptogenic stroke (2. 32 % of cryptogenic events; 95 % confidence interval 0. 06 - 12. 29), whereas SEC was found in five patients (7. 7 % overall), two with a lacunar and three with a cryptogenic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS—An early TOE {{does not seem to}} increase substantially the detection of atrial thrombi or SEC in patients with a first stroke or <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attack</b> of cryptogenic or lacunar nature. Therefore, this examination can be carried out when the patients' conditions are stable, and without overloading the cardiovascular laboratory daily schedule. ...|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{patients}} with brucellosis presented with neurological features closely simulating <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attacks,</b> cerebral infarction, acute confusional state, motor neuron disease, progressive multisystem degeneration, polyradiculoneuropathy, neuralgic amyotrophy, sciatica and cauda equina syndrome. Most patients improved quickly after adequate antibiotic treatment but chronic cases responded poorly.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} cerebral vasomotor reactivity in {{five patients}} with limb shaking <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attacks</b> by using transcranial Doppler sonography.  METHOD—Attacks with transient limb shaking were unilateral in four patients and bilateral in one. Internal carotid arteries {{on the side}} opposite the abnormal limb movements showed three 90 - 95 % stenoses and three occlusions as assessed by cerebral angiography in three and magnetic resonance angiography and ultrasound in one case each. Reactivity of cerebral resistance vessels was studied by measuring peak mean velocities in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) {{before and after the}} application of CO 2 enriched air. Reference values were obtained from 25 normal subjects.  RESULTS—During hypercapnia peak mean velocities slightly decreased in five MCAs (steal phenomenon) and remained unchanged in one MCA opposite the abnormal movements, whereas the other MCAs showed normal reactivities.  CONCLUSION—The delineation of an exhausted cerebral vasoreactivity in all hemispheres opposite the involuntary limb movements suggests that haemodynamic failure is the cause of <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attacks</b> with limb shaking. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{completion}} of the international extracranial/intracranial (EC/IC) bypass study in 1985, no treatment of proven value has become available for patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion other than treatment with antithrombotic medication. However, in this trial the causal factors of cerebral ischaemia were not part of the inclusion criteria and also patients with single episodes only were included. We report successful Excimer laser-assisted high flow EC/IC bypass surgery in a patient with frequent <b>transient</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attacks</b> associated with a low flow state of the cerebral circulation. In the 1. 5 years after the operation the patient has never again experienced any symptoms of cerebral ischaemia. In addition there was improvement in cerebral blood flow, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomography. Certain patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery may benefit from EC/IC bypass surgery, in particular the Excimer laser-assisted high-flow bypass, that is, if recurrent (<b>transient)</b> <b>ischaemic</b> <b>attacks</b> are associated with compromised cerebral perfusion...|$|R
