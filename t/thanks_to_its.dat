5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension is debatable.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} also {{considered}} to be sustainable <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> power to sustain the Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations {{to use their own}} resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used. Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E

5|$|In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the}} thrones of Austria-Hungary, {{was assassinated}} by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden {{deterioration}} in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary {{was supported by the}} German Empire, whilst Serbia had the backing of the Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> responsibilities under the Dual Alliance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> rich heritage, which {{includes}} the renowned Humanist Library and an imposing pair of medieval churches, Sélestat is an important tourist destination in Alsace. It also benefits from its location on the Alsace wine road and its proximity to Haut-Kœnigsbourg castle. Aside from the medieval old town, the commune of Sélestat encompasses a nature reserve including {{one of the largest}} riparian forests of France.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> {{status as}} a {{first-class}} fortification, Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice. Work was even done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added {{in the summer of}} 1865, and the parapets of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the fortification.|$|E
50|$|Gavion (Gyabion): Gavan's private tank, {{only used}} in the final battles. Like Dol, he stands up on the tank and {{commands}} it. This heavy vehicle is quite deadly <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> all <b>its</b> lasers and cannons. Scooper is contained inside.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} well known for its ski resort <b>thanks</b> {{especially}} <b>to</b> <b>its</b> relative proximity <b>to</b> Bishkek (approx. 100 km), its night skiing facility as well as its regular treatment with snow groomers and snow cannons.|$|R
50|$|Paris Passion was a {{visually}} striking magazine, <b>thanks</b> both <b>to</b> <b>its</b> large {{format and}} the quality of its photography, illustration and art direction. Its visual presentation, most of which focused on Paris, was an important part of its appeal.|$|R
5|$|Hong Kong {{soon became}} a major entrepôt <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> free port status, {{attracting}} new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe. The society, however, remained racially segregated and polarised under early British colonial policies. Despite {{the rise of a}} British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas such as Victoria Peak. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no political representation in the British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the street}} was mainly {{inhabited}} by merchants and craftspeople. Although they are long gone due to the sweeping demographic changes in Kiev during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the street is once again thriving <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> unique topology, architecture, rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists. The descent {{is one of the}} favorite spots for tourists. It is also notable for the many festivals it holds, including various art festivals and the Kiev Day celebrations on the last weekend of May.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E
50|$|While rugby {{league is}} not as popular as rugby union in Scotland, it has {{maintained}} a continuous presence {{for over a century}} in the country, <b>thanks</b> partly <b>to</b> <b>its</b> proximity <b>to</b> Northern England which is the heartland of the game.|$|R

Ghidighici Lake has higher self-epuration capacity, and <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> this <b>its</b> waters are cleaner then others urban studied lakes.

5|$|Originally {{the name}} {{was applied to the}} {{peninsula}} but it now usually refers to the town itself. The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its herring industry. <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> seascapes, fishermen and evening light, {{towards the end of the}} 19th century it became popular with a group of Impressionist artists now known as the Skagen Painters. In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the Skagensbanen railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> {{appearance}} in the Orange Bowl and a revenue-sharing agreement with other Big East schools, Virginia Tech earned $3.981 million for playing in the 1996 Orange Bowl. $3.5 million of that total came directly from the bowl, while the remaining $481,000 came from the revenue-sharing pool generated by all the Big East teams that participated in bowl games. The almost-$4 million payout made Virginia Tech's football team the wealthiest of the 36 schools that participated in bowl games after the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|The Schiehallion {{experiment}} was an 18th-century experiment {{to determine the}} mean density of the Earth. Funded {{by a grant from}} the Royal Society, it was conducted in the summer of 1774 around the Scottish mountain of Schiehallion, Perthshire. The experiment involved measuring the tiny deflection of a pendulum due to the gravitational attraction of a nearby mountain. Schiehallion was considered the ideal location after a search for candidate mountains, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> isolation and almost symmetrical shape. One of the triggers for the experiment were anomalies noted during the survey of the Mason–Dixon Line.|$|E
50|$|The North {{enjoys a}} {{relatively}} high level of development in infrastructure <b>thanks</b> mainly <b>to</b> <b>its</b> most prominent native son, Ahmadou Ahidjo, Cameroon's first president.

5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} upon its release, largely <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> graphical presentation. The game {{has since been}} re-released on the Virtual Console service for both the Wii and the Wii U consoles in PAL regions, North America, and Japan, {{as well as for}} the New Nintendo 3DS in North America. A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996. After many years of announcements and cancellations, Nintendo released a second sequel, Pilotwings Resort, in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS handheld.|$|E
5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> {{opening weekend}} of $30.5 million, the film broke the box-office {{record for the}} Labor Day weekend, surpassing the record set in 2005 by Transporter 2 with $20.1 million. It still {{currently}} resides as the top Labor Day weekend grosser. Halloween was also the 8th highest-grossing R-rated film of 2007, and finished out the year in 44th place for domestic box office gross. With its $58 million box office gross, Halloween was the second highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, taken over by A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) with $63 million. However, it is third in the list which consists of When a Stranger Calls (2006) at $47.8 million, Black Christmas (2006) at $16.3 million, Prom Night (2008) at $43.8 million, My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009) with $51.4 million, and Friday the 13th (2009) leading the group with $60 million. Halloween is also ranked eleventh overall when comparing it {{to all of the}} horror remakes, as well as eighth place for all slasher films in general, in unadjusted dollars.|$|E
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} the 2014 Blu-ray/DVD release, Stuart Galbraith of DVDTalk remarked: “’’The Big Gundown’’ is an unusually fine film, <b>thanks</b> mainly <b>to</b> <b>its</b> taut, intelligent screenplay (heavily reworked by Sollima), Lee Van Cleef's marvelous screen presence, {{and especially the}} outstanding musical score by the great Ennio Morricone.“ ...|$|R

5|$|The Benedictine priory {{was closed}} in 1424 {{after many years}} of decline. It had long lost its power to the local nobility that were {{gradually}} replaced by the bourgeoisie in the mid-14th century. Nevertheless, Sélestat remained a religious centre even after the closing of the priory. Convents were established in the 13th century by Dominicans, Knights Hospitaller and Franciscans. Several abbeys located outside of the town also had a residence in town. At the beginning of the 16th century, Sélestat was a noted centre of Renaissance humanism <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> celebrated Latin school. Reformers Beatus Rhenanus and Martin Bucer were among the school's alumni. This school helped spread Protestant ideas among the population, although the local authorities remained faithful to Rome. Erasmus of Rotterdam visited Sélestat four times between 1515 and 1522.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral and the Viking Ship Museum, which {{contains}} the well-preserved remains of five 11th-century ships, attract more than 100,000 visitors annually. In {{addition to its}} internationally recognized tourist attractions and its annual rock festival, Roskilde is popular with shoppers <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> two centrally located pedestrian streets complete with restaurants, cafés, {{and a variety of}} shops. The city is home to the FC Roskilde football club which play in the Danish 1st Division, the Roskilde Vikings RK rugby club, and the rowing club, Roskilde Roklub. In the 1970s, the city benefited from the opening of the university and from the completion of the Holbæk Motorway connecting it to Copenhagen. Roskilde has the oldest operational railway station in Denmark, with connections across Zealand as well as with Falster, Lolland, and Jutland. The local airport opened in 1973, mainly serving light aircraft for business use and flight instruction.|$|E
5000|$|David Knox, {{writer for}} TV Tonight also gave the series 4 out of 5 stars saying [...] "The sequel stands up well, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> {{retaining}} <b>its</b> links with director Michael Jenkins and Roxburgh.
