5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid.

The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E

5|$|With Goya {{we do not}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio or even of {{the artist}} at work. We think only of the event.

5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and {{did not know what to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Orchid Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

5|$|The {{band members}} all {{responded to this}} {{production}} method differently, with Iwadera and Kusakari finding the approach the easiest. Okazaki and Ejima both had trouble adopting this method. Okazaki was very anxious about her ability to create demos, having never used music software before, and not even owning a computer before moving to Tokyo. Yamaguchi bought her an iBook to help her with the process. Ejima found difficulty in recording demos due {{to the problem of}} recording drums at home for sound sampling. As a result, he learnt how to play the guitar. In June, the band were creating songs on a daily basis, and in August were still in the pre-production stages of the album. The album was created at Yamaguchi's apartment in Noborito in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, which became a meeting place for all of the band members for the album. In total, around thirty demo compositions were produced for the album. This method of song production also led to Yamaguchi being able to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album as a whole, as opposed to their methods on Go to the Future and Night Fishing, in which each song was thought of in its own individual context.|$|E
