5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>my</b> opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean fleet was by {{now under}} Sir Edward Pellew, and Eyre {{was sent to}} the Spanish coast to support the Spanish forces {{fighting}} the French. Eyre was particularly active off the coast of Valencia and evacuated the garrison of Oropesa del Mar, earning the thanks of General Joaquín Blake y Joyes. On being ordered back to England in 1811 Pellew also wrote a private letter of thanks, following on from his earlier declaration that 'I have <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>my</b> complete approbation of Captain Eyre's methods, and have much satisfaction of employing the services of that most excellent officer in the aid of the Valencia patriots.' Eyre arrived in England in 1812, his health having been affected by his five years on a foreign station, and requested and received permission to go ashore. As a mark of his services in the Adriatic and off Spain he was knighted by King George III. Eyre was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 4 June 1814 and was nominated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath following the expansion of the order on 12 January 1815.|$|E

[...] On one occasion on the Magic Tour, Jay Weinberg had sat in on drums for [...] "Born to Run". [...] This was confirmed by Springsteen on March 20, who said that Jay Weinberg would be drumming at a small number of shows during the tour.

[...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>my</b> ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after.
