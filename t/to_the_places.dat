5|$|Remains of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{were found}} during {{fieldwork}} in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001. The species was described in a 2010 paper by Pierre Mein and colleagues, together with another extinct rodent, Nesomys narindaensis. The specific name, mahajambaensis, refers to Mahajamba Bay, which is close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> where the species has been found. It {{is placed in the}} genus Brachytarsomys, together with two larger living species, B.albicauda and B.villosa. Brachytarsomys is classified in the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the peasant war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> where the leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor {{the memories of the}} event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E

25|$|During Soviet times, apartments were lent {{to people}} by the {{government}} according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors).

Estonia reaffirmed its respect to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.|$|E

25|$|The film {{generated}} huge {{interest in}} Scotland and in Scottish history, not only around the world, {{but also in}} Scotland itself.

At a Braveheart Convention in 1997, held in Stirling the day after the Scottish Devolution vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, Braveheart author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film. Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} the Red Cross and other {{humanitarian}} societies was facilitated by their official recognition through the Second Hague Convention: “Relief societies for prisoners of war, which are properly constituted {{in accordance with the}} laws of their country and with the object of serving as the channel for charitable effort shall receive from the belligerents, for themselves and their duly accredited agents every facility for the efficient performance of their humane task within the bounds imposed by military necessities and administrative regulations. Agents of these societies may be admitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> of internment for the purpose of distributing relief, as also to the halting places of repatriated prisoners, if furnished with a personal permit by the military authorities, and on giving an undertaking in writing to comply with all measures of order and police which the latter may issue”.|$|E
25|$|Kee MacFarlane, {{a social}} worker {{employed}} by the Children's Institute International, developed {{a new way to}} interrogate children with anatomically correct dolls and used them in an effort to assist disclosures of abuse with the McMartin children. After asking the children to point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> on the dolls where they had allegedly been touched and asking leading questions, MacFarlane diagnosed sexual abuse in virtually all the McMartin children. She coerced disclosures by using lengthy interviews that rewarded discussions of abuse and punished denials. The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred. Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants. After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were acquitted on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty. Buckey was re-charged and two years later released without conviction.|$|E

500|$|The {{gunshot wounds}} that Scully, and later Mulder, {{discover}} on Maurice and Lyda were created on a computer. Special effects editor Bill Millar was tasked with designing the [...] "bloodless bullet holes" [...] {{that were on}} Asner's head and Tomlin's stomach. To create this effect, Millar attached orange fluorescent cloth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> that would become the bullet wounds. An ultraviolet light was then added to the set lighting so that the invisible reflected light would function as tracking data. The orange cloth was then excised during post-production and the computerized bullet wounds were inserted in their place. Millar admits that the technique was borrowed from the 1992 movie Death Becomes Her, although he sarcastically admitted that, [...] "we did it better and with less money." [...] Gillian Anderson was later critical of the fake blood used for the episode because the sheer quantity soon coagulated and formed a [...] "gummy mess." ...|$|E
500|$|A permit {{from the}} Commissioner of Police is {{required}} if a candidate wishes {{to hold an}} election meeting between nomination day and {{the day before the}} eve of polling day. The display of banners and posters by candidates during the campaigning period must also be authorized by the returning officer, who may impose conditions as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> where or objects or things on which, and the manner in which, banners or posters {{may or may not be}} displayed. The returning officer also determines the maximum number of banners and posters that may be put up, bearing in mind the number of electors and the need to treat candidates equally. Further authorization is required if a candidate wishes to display election advertising in some other medium, such as a television broadcast; a display visible from any place to which the public or a section of the public has access; or a newspaper, magazine or periodical. Election banners and posters may not be displayed in such a way that they obscure the view of other banners and posters, or within [...] (or a shorter distance if so determined by the returning officer) of a polling station. Making inscriptions on buildings or roads is prohibited.

Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel."
