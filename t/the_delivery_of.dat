5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Braathens SAFE {{started looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin pressurization. Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. They were put into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo–Trondheim, once daily Oslo–Ålesund, twice daily Oslo–Stavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. <b>The</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary, and these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and {{were used for the}} first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.|$|E

New Brunswick's largest and smallest rural communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. Rural communities elect local councils and are responsible for <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> some local services, including administrative services, community planning and emergency measures. The province of New Brunswick ensures <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities.

30|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio <b>of</b> high-priority packets, we {{are also}} {{interested}} to analyze <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio <b>of</b> low-priority packets.

As can be observed, <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SDS algorithm is lower than EDF and MFL {{in most of the}} cases. It is even lower than FCFS in video stream Tokyo Olympics after the traffic load is larger than 140 %. This reflects the fact that the high-delivery ratio of high-priority packets is at the cost of low-delivery ratio of low-priority packets when the traffic load is very heavy.|$|R
