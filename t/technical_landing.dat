30|$|Polak and Warwick (2013) urge project proponents {{to clarify}} the central problem, {{talk to the people}} with the problem, and listen to and {{understand}} them, to craft the essential intent (McKeown 2014), including scope and boundary conditions. Infrastructure projects are engineer-driven and top-down. Stakeholder engagement in southern Africa is typically authoritarian and only informs and invites comment. No wonder problems arise, as with GFIP. The World Bank’s experience with land reform shows that achieving success goes beyond <b>technical</b> <b>land</b> management and depends on the institutional environment and factors that determine investment and profitability (Binswanger 2007). Insight into the lives of the stakeholders requires surveys to seek unbiased perceptions, one-on-one dialogue and forum discussion, and stakeholder buy-in is helped by facilitating meetings where stakeholders decide their priorities, and by involving them in implementation (Decker et al. 2012). For a project to be sustainable, it must be profitable and ideally all stakeholders must benefit (Polak and Warwick 2013; Simanis and Duke 2014). Porter and Kramer (2006) reshape corporate social responsibility from philanthropy to corporate social integration through designing business activities in which society shares value. One of their examples is Nestlé developing a dairy business at Moga, India. Nestlé built refrigerated dairies and sent trucks to collect milk, at the same time dispensing veterinary and agronomic services, paying more for milk, increasing local farmers from 180 to 75 000, prompting competitive dairies and milk factories and spawning an industry cluster.|$|R

The research, funded by Italy Penox Company Ltd. provides <b>technical</b> <b>land</b> reclamation as the application of in situ phytoremediation. The project is currently under evaluation by the Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea to allow a large scale application. In order to identify areas, where contamination exceeds the limits set by law (DM 152 / 2006) for industrial sites, soil samplings and analyses were carried out. To reduce the impact on the landscape and to limit the agronomic expensive operations relating to future management, native species, including Arbutus unedo L., Hedera elix L., Pinus pinaster Ait., Laurus nobilis L., Smilax aspera L., Ilex aquifolium L., Myrtus communis L., Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Erica arborea L., spread in contaminated areas, were identified by floral and vegetational analyses and their lead content was determined.

40|$|The {{global climate}} threat has {{intensified}} Sweden’s ambitions to build wind power stations. This thesis explores the planning of, and opposition to, wind {{power in the}} inland rural and forest regions of Sweden. It is in these autonomous communities that the plans are implemented and {{the aim of the}} thesis was to, from a local perspective, understand and analyse the planning and acceptance challenges that large-scale wind power development faces in places that are both sparsely populated and have good wind conditions. This thesis is based on qualitative methods and was conducted as two studies. The case study area comprises four municipalities in Dalarna County. The first study analyses the planning and establishment process in three municipalities using interviews and an analysis method called process tracing. The second study analyses one wind power establishment, in which the interviews form the basis for a discourse analytical approach. One striking finding highlights the relationship between the global and the local. Global environment and energy aspects are absent in the local process, and wind power becomes a <b>technical</b> <b>land</b> issue that clashes with other local land interests. Another finding of the study reveals that planning for wind power establishment follows a rational planning tradition. The feelings and memories of the individual – different views regarding the landscape – play a background role in the formal permit process, while measurable observable conditions have a more prominent role. Wind power developers thereby acquire a more significant position than what they probably would have had if the planning had included local residents’ views on wind power in the landscape at an early stage...|$|R

40|$|The current {{outbreak}} of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is spiraling out of control, {{but it never}} had to happen. What can the international community do now to bring the epidemic under control, {{and how can we}} prevent the next one? The counties most affected by Ebola (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), rank among the lowest in global development, lacking essential public health infrastructure. If the affected countries had adequate public health systems, they probably would have contained Ebola within rural settings, avoiding the first outbreak in major urban areas. More than 130 health workers have died from Ebola during the current outbreak, depleting already scarce human resources. Hospitals lack personal protective equipment and safe isolation facilities, becoming amplification points for transmission. The absence of basic public health infrastructure means that countries have instead often resorted to military-led cordons sanitaires, without ensuring access to basic necessities, such as food, clean water, and health care. This article proposes an International Health Systems Fund, encompassing both emergency response capabilities and enduring health-system development. The WHO’s Ebola response roadmap estimates than an initial US$ 490 million in global resources over 6 months would be needed to curb the outbreak, although the total costs are likely to be considerably higher. What is needed is a standing crisis fund to ensure surge capacity {{in the event of a}} WHO declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To prevent future epidemics, and to provide health services for the entire population, we also urgently need a sustainable International Health Systems Fund to build long-term capacity. This fund, however, would require multibillion-dollar investment. Although large, the international community has mobilized before on this scale through PEPFAR and the Global Fund. The West African Ebola epidemic should spark a badly needed global course correction that would favor strong health infrastructure. It would encourage high-income countries to meet their International Health Regulations obligations to mobilize financial resources and provide <b>technical</b> <b>land</b> logistical support to develop, strengthen, and maintain public health capacity, especially in lower-income countries. Although the scale of investment would be substantial, it is a wise and affordable investment in containing global health hazards, and moving towards a right-to-health based universal health coverage...|$|R
