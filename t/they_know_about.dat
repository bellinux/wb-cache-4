5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to what <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> other galaxies; {{it is difficult to}} observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

Those who passed the auditions were flown to Hollywood to compete with their cats as contestants. The program, which was hosted by Chuck Woolery, executive produced by David Doyle, and sponsored by Meow Mix, premiered as a one-time special on November 15, 2008. Reruns of the program aired four times {{throughout the rest of the}} month. Woolery expressed excitement at the prospects of the special, stating that the show [...] "was designed to prove or disprove" [...] that owners know everything they think <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> cats. Steve Ochi, a writer {{for the show}}, called the project a [...] "success", though a minor incident did occur when a camera-shy cat forced the producers to use a stuffed cat for some shots. No new episodes have been produced since the original special.|$|E
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E

The Dean of the Secret Order of Dirty Joke Writers appears from the shadows and leads the group into a large library, where the world's greatest geniuses study. The Dean explains {{that many of the}} world's greatest geniuses have come together to create dirty jokes and tailor jokes to where the need is greatest. The Dean takes them into a dark room. He reveals {{that they will not be}} permitted to leave the island now that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the network of joke distribution agents, like the bellhop.

2500|$|The series had two interns, dubbed [...] "Mythterns": Discovery Channel contest winner Christine Chamberlain and viewer {{building}} contest-winner Jess Nelson. During {{the first}} season, the program featured segments with folklorist Heather Joseph-Witham, who explained {{the origins of}} certain myths, and other people who had first-hand experience with the myths being tested, but those elements were phased out early during the series. The MythBusters still commonly consult with experts for myths or topics for which they need assistance. These topics include firearms, for which they mostly consult Lt. Al Normandy of the South San Francisco Police Department, and explosives, for which they consult retired FBI explosives expert Frank Doyle and Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The MythBusters often ask other people, such as those supplying the equipment being tested, what <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the myth under investigation.

2500|$|The game {{begins with}} Gandalf (voiced by Tom Kane) visiting Frodo (Steve Staley) and {{explaining}} the significance {{and history of}} the Ring. Frodo suggests it be destroyed, and Gandalf explains only the fires that created it are powerful enough to do so; the fires of Mount Doom, deep in Mordor. As Gandalf cannot take the Ring himself, for fear it would corrupt him, Frodo volunteers to do so. An eavesdropping Samwise Gamgee (voiced by Scott Menville in PC & PS2, but Cliff Broadway in Xbox) volunteers to join Frodo and Gandalf agrees, telling them they must head to Rivendell and speak to Elrond. He also tells Frodo never to use the Ring, as to do so will begin to corrupt him, and will draw the attention of Sauron and the Nazgûl. On the night of Frodo's departure, a Nazgûl arrives in The Shire looking for the Baggins' home. Frodo is able to evade the Nazgûl and heads to meet Sam, whom he finds accompanied by Peregrin [...] "Pippin" [...] Took (James Arnold Taylor) and Meriadoc [...] "Merry" [...] Brandybuck (Quinton Flynn). Much to Frodo's surprise <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the Ring and Sauron, as they have been spying on Bilbo, Frodo and Gandalf for years. They vow to join Frodo on his quest.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the text}} of most pages, there are usually {{a large number of}} {{hypertext}} links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more [...] "native" [...] to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain [...] "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an ad hoc, unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> a subject new to the wiki.
