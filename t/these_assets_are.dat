25|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} 34 Mars meteorites. <b>These</b> <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> highly valuable since {{they are the only}} physical samples available of Mars. Studies conducted by NASA's Johnson Space Center show that at least three of the meteorites contain potential evidence of past life on Mars, in the form of microscopic structures resembling fossilized bacteria (so-called biomorphs). Although the scientific evidence collected is reliable, its interpretation varies. To date, none of the original lines of scientific evidence for the hypothesis that the biomorphs are of exobiological origin (the so-called biogenic hypothesis) have been either discredited or positively ascribed to non-biological explanations.|$|E
25|$|The Wallops mobile range {{instrumentation}} includes telemetry, radar, {{command and}} power systems. <b>These</b> <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> used {{as needed to}} supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range to ensure safety and collect data to support the rocket customers in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at Poker Flat, Alaska; Andoya, Norway; and Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands. The Wallops Mobile Instrumentation is integrated with NASA and Department of Defense networks {{and can be used}} to supplement established ranges in support of rocket launches.|$|E

25|$|A centre forward (main striker) has the key task {{of scoring}} goals {{and for this}} reason acts as {{the focal point of the}} {{majority}} of attacking play by a team. As such, how well a striker is performing tends to be measured purely on goals scored despite the fact that they may be contributing in other ways to a team's success. A traditional centre forward was required to be tall in height and strong physically in order to be able to win the ball in the area from crosses and attempt to score with either their feet or head, or to knock the ball down for a teammate to score. Whilst <b>these</b> <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> still an advantage, in the modern game speed and movement are also required as there is more interplay when attacking. In a 4–4–2 or 4–4–1–1 formation the centre forward is often paired with a second striker who may play around him or in a slightly withdrawn role respectively, though it is not unknown to play two recognised centre forwards.|$|E

2500|$|Federal Reserve Notes {{are legal}} tender, {{with the words}} [...] "this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private" [...] printed on each note. They have {{replaced}} United States Notes, which were once issued by the Treasury Department. Federal Reserve Notes are backed by {{the assets of the}} Federal Reserve Banks, which serve as collateral under Section 16. <b>These</b> <b>assets</b> <b>are</b> generally Treasury securities which have been purchased by the Federal Reserve through its Federal Open Market Committee in a process called debt monetizing. This monetized debt can increase the money supply, either with the issuance of new Federal Reserve Notes or with the creation of debt money (deposits). This increase in the monetary base leads to a larger increase in the money supply through fractional-reserve banking as deposits are lent and re-deposited where they form the basis of further loans.|$|E
