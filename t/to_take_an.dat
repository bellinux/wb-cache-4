5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority from occurring in the first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E
5|$|Additionally {{a family}} of {{derivative}} launch vehicles was proposed in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> advantage of economies of scale, further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a Reusable First Stage {{in a class of}} small and medium size launch vehicles like Vega and Arianespace Soyuz, the Super-Heavy Lift Launcher capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the orbit, and a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated reusable orbiter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble those of}} hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> anti-tank mine. When not in use, the sockets were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E

5|$|Benefitting {{from the}} advent of postcards, Mary Willumsen (1884–1961) photographed women in scanty {{clothing}} or nude at the Helgoland beach facility in Copenhagen. Between 1916 and 1920, she took many such photographs which she sold at a nearby kiosk. The operation was discontinued when the police began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> interest. Many of the compositions are now considered to have considerable artistic merit.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{was born}} in Buda on 7 July 1540. On {{learning}} of his birth, his father, who was on campaign in Transylvania, rode to his soldiers' camp to inform them of the good news. The following day John fell ill, and he died on 21 or 22 July. Before his death he persuaded those present at his death bed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> oath that they would prevent the transfer of his realm to Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|One of the accused, Demdike, {{had been}} {{regarded}} {{in the area}} as a witch for fifty years, {{and some of the}} deaths the witches were accused of had happened many years before Roger Nowell started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> interest in 1612.

5|$|After Wade's resignation, Crisp {{was again}} {{retained}} {{on the football}} staff. Working under Frank Thomas, Crisp continued in his role of line coach, and again won {{a share of the}} national championship after the 1934 season. Under Thomas, Crisp's role outside of his duties as the line coach was that of the team disciplinarian to compliment the soft-spoken, diplomatic style of Thomas. He continued in his role as line coach {{through the end of the}} 1941 season when he took a leave of absence to serve as a civilian physical training instructor for the U.S. Navy pre-flight school at the University of Georgia. He then returned to Alabama and again served as line coach for the 1945 season, before he left <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> assistant coaching position with the Miami Seahawks.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Britain in 1883, Louise continued <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> interest in Canada. During the North-West Rebellion of 1885 she sent a certain Dr. Boyd with medical supplies {{and a large}} fund of money for distribution. Her express instructions were that assistance was to be rendered to friend and foe indiscriminately. To fulfill her wishes, Boyd accompanied the Militia Medical Staff, under Dr. Thomas Roddick to the sites of the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche to help give medical treatment to the wounded, including the Métis opposition.|$|E

5|$|After the show, {{the song}} {{went on to}} chart in several European countries, {{reaching}} number one in Austria and the UK Indie Chart, as well as reaching the top 10 in a further 10 countries. Wurst's appearance in the contest brought about both criticism and praise: {{by some of the}} more socially conservative sections of European society her victory in the contest was condemned as a promotion of LGBT rights; conversely the international attention received by Wurst's victory firmly established her among the LGBT community, leading her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> active role in promoting tolerance and respect, and resulted in several invites to perform at several European pride events, as well as performances at the European Parliament and United Nations Office at Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|Atkins {{was arrested}} in November 2011 for {{allegedly}} trying to smother his wife with a pillow, while his 10-year-old son watched. He was released on $2,500 bail three hours after the arrest, and was ordered by the Williamson County, Tennessee court <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> anger assessment which found no need for any further action. The altercation was disputed by Atkins' lawyer, who stated that it was purely verbal. Atkins filed for divorce within 24 hours of the alleged assault. The divorce was settled in late-September 2012. In February 2012, Atkins was cleared of the domestic assault charge.|$|E

5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> active role in the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, most of {{the ships}} had been {{withdrawn}} to secondary roles, with Elba having {{been converted into a}} seaplane tender. Puglia was {{the only member of the}} class <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> active role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria was deliberately blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
