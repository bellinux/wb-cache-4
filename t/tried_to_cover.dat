5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E
5|$|While Cope and Marsh dueled for fossils in the American West, {{they also}} tried {{their best to}} ruin each other's {{professional}} credibility. Humiliated by his error in reconstructing the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus, Cope <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> up his mistake by purchasing every copy he could find of the journal {{in which it was}} published. Marsh, meanwhile, made sure to publicize the story. Cope's own rapid and prodigious output of scientific papers meant that Marsh had no difficulty in finding occasional errors with which to lambast Cope. Marsh himself was not infallible; he put the wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared it a new genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E

25|$|The Naval Criminal Investigative Service {{conducted}} an investigation, releasing a heavily redacted report in 2008.

However, with the closing of the Oxegen website's forum and an external, unofficial forum set up later, by threat of legal action from MCD, many believe that MCD <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> up the problems at Oxegen 2006.|$|E

Even though this verdict exposed him to the death penalty, Chaumareys was sentenced to only three years in jail.|$|E

25|$|At first, units <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> their sectors every day. Later, {{the number}} and {{seriousness}} of border violations by Mexicans decreased, and the patrols tapered off. In the autumn of 1920, the schedule for the 1st Surveillance Group called for flights twice a week. When exercises with ground forces or other activities interfered, patrols might be canceled for days or even weeks at a time. Brig. Gen. William Mitchell’s need for men and planes from the border for bombing tests against naval vessels off the Virginia Capes in June 1921 brought border patrol to an end.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a Hindu {{temple in}} Lahore was {{destroyed}} {{to pave the}} way for construction of a multi-storied commercial building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper Dawn <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site. In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down. The 25 March 2014 Express Tribune citing a All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement (PHRM) survey said that 95% of all Hindu temples in Pakistan have been converted since 1990. Pakistanis attack Hindu temples if anything happens to any mosque in neighbouring India.|$|E
25|$|The pace of killings slowed in 1942, as ghettoised Jewish slave {{workers were}} {{appropriated}} by the Wehrmacht. As Soviet troops advanced in 1943, the Nazi units <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> up the crime under the Aktion 1005 directive. Eighty inmates {{from the nearby}} Stutthof concentration camp were formed into Leichenkommando ("corpse units"). The workers were forced to dig up bodies, pile them on wood and burn them. The ashes were then ground up, mixed with sand and buried. After months of this gruesome work, the brigade managed to escape through a tunnel dug with spoons on 19 April 1944. Eleven of the 80 who escaped survived the war; their testimony contributed to revealing the massacre.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{an effort}} to crack down on {{corruption}} by the eunuchs inspired by Johnston, Puyi ordered an inventory of the treasures in the Forbidden City, which caused the Hall of Supreme Harmony to go up in flames in a case of arson on the night of 26 June 1923 as the eunuchs <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> up the extent of their theft. Johnston reported on the next day he “found the Emperor and Empress standing on a heap of charred wood, sadly contemplating the spectacle”. The treasures reported lost in the fire include 2,685golden statues of Lord Buddha, 1,675golden altar ornaments, 435porcelain antiques, and 31boxes of sable furs, though it is likely that most if not all of these treasures were sold on the black market before the building was set afire.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match of}} the night, the third to feature CMLL and Invasores on {{opposite}} sides, was {{centered around the}} personal issues between CMLL representative La Sombra and Invasor Olímpico, focusing {{on the fact that}} La Sombra had won Olímpico's match at the previous month's CMLL 77th Anniversary Show and Olímpico was eager to gain his revenge. La Sombra teamed up with Máscara Dorada and La Máscara to take on Olímpico, Alebrije and Psicosis. The first fall ended after just over six minutes of wrestling as Psicosis pinned La Máscara and Alebrije pinned Máscara Dorada. In the second fall Máscara Dorada pinned Olímpico, followed by La Sombra pinning El Alebrije to even the match between the two teams. In the closing moments of the match Olímpico tried to kick La Sombra in the groin, but Sombra caught the foot to prevent it. Instead Olímpico pulled off La Sombra's mask {{in full view of the}} referee to draw the disqualification, then he kicked La Sombra in the groin. Los Invasores ignored the referee and proceeded to beat up La Máscara and Máscara Dorada as well, stealing the masks of all three tecnicos and then challenging the team to a future Luchas de Apuestas match, a challenge that was ignored as the three tecnicos <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> up as best they could.|$|E
25|$|By 7:00 a.m. Albertone was {{arraying}} {{his remaining}} battalions {{on the nearby}} Mount Semaiata, leaving Turitto and the two batteries on the Kidane Meret to cover his movements. He wrote a message to Baratieri, informing {{him that he was}} under heavy attack and in dire need of reinforcements: it would reach the commander only at 8:15. From 7:30, the 1st Native Battalion held off increasing numbers of enemy troops until 8:30, when it was forced to retreat. At this time, about 18 thousands Ethiopians were converging on Albertone's brigade in an half moon formation, trying to encircle it, and the strong Ethiopian northern wing occupied Mount Gusoso, cutting any existing link between Albertone and Dabormida's relif attempt. For about two hours, the ascari under Albertone held their position, the artillery inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers, but then the Ethiopians set up quick-firing batteries on the Kidane Meret. While Menelik was committing more troops from his own command, the badly mauled flanks of the Native Brigade collapsed, and by 10:30 the whole brigade, low on ammunition, started a fighting retreat that soon turned into a rout. The batteries that <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the withdrawal were captured, retaken by ascari with a bayonet charge, then definitely lost, their crews annihilated. Albertone was captured leading his troops, and his brigade shattered shortly afterwards.|$|E
