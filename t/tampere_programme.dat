50|$|After the <b>Tampere</b> <b>Programme</b> of 1999 and the Hague Programme of 2004, the Stockholm Programme is {{the third}} {{programme}} of its kind for {{the states of the}} European Union.It has been prepared by the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union on its informal meeting on July 15 through 17 of 2009 and was named after the place of its publication (Stockholm, the capital of Sweden). After decisions-making by the ministers of the interior and the ministers for justice on the first of December it was presented to the European Council on 10th and 11th that month for the final referendum on its summit in Brussels.|$|E
40|$|The ‘Area of Freedom, Security and Justice’ in the EU has {{experienced}} significant developments during the <b>Tampere</b> <b>programme</b> (1999 – 2004). This paper {{makes the point}} that European integration is possible in areas of ‘high politics’, such as asylum policy. Significantly, the European Commission can (though not always does) {{play a significant role in}} this process - the role of a supranational policy entrepreneur that enables the normative construction of a policy. The paper analyses the high-profile case of the European Asylum Policy, particularly the four main directives, its legal and political construction, and demonstrates the significance of the Commission in the political and normative process...|$|E
40|$|Two {{subjects}} often {{fit with}} difficulty in ‘Fortress Europe’: Equality and Third Country Nationals (TCNs). EC Law presents fundamental weaknesses {{with regard to}} TCNs in the intersections between race, religion and nationality discrimination. In particular for non-EU nationals, these three grounds of discrimination can be closely related, and difficult to distinguish. However, they are of great importance for the integration and fair treatment of migrants, {{which was one of}} the objectives of the <b>Tampere</b> <b>Programme.</b> This article analyses the extent to which the Race Equality Directive (43 / 2000 /EC) and the Framework Equality Directive (78 / 2000 /EC) provide an effective protection against ‘racial related discrimination’. It suggests that the loopholes of both Directives, together with the current interpretation of Article 12 EC, have institutionalised not only a hierarchy of equalities, but also a hierarchy of peoples, and it explores possible interpretative solutions...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the <b>Tampere</b> and Stockholm <b>programmes</b> have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|R
40|$|The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) {{experienced}} significant developments {{during the}} <b>Tampere</b> <b>programme</b> (1999 – 2004). This article analyses how security is constituted or {{viewed by the}} European Union {{in the area of}} asylum policy; more importantly how the European Commission, {{in the face of the}} emerging discourse on the ‘war on terror ’ decided to push for a more inclusive agenda. Thus, the European Commission can (though not always does) play a significant role in this process- the role of a supranational policy entrepreneur that enables the normative construction of a policy. The article analyses the high-profile case of the first phase of the CEAS, particularly the four main directives, its legal and political construction, and suggests the significance of the Commission in the political and normative process. Despite the challenges of the ‘war on terror’, the Commission managed to keep the CEAS within the limits of the Geneva Convention...|$|E
40|$|The {{agreements}} reached {{within the}} frameworks of the Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere European Council in 1999 would {{set off a}} flurry of activity {{in the areas of}} EU immigration, asylum and migrant/minority ‘integration ’ policy. In conjunction with these policy areas moving up the EU agenda, moreover, this rapidly growing activity would expand well beyond the confines of the Amsterdam and Tampere programmes. The European Commission’s bold move to declare an end to the era of ‘zero ’ extra-Community labour immigration, as well as the expanding ‘externalization ’ of the EU’s immigration and asylum policies to third countries, are just two of several examples highlighting this dynamic development. This paper focuses on the unfolding EU policies in the fields of ‘integration’, anti-discrimination, immigration, and asylum. In terms of demarcations, it covers the development up until the conclusion of the <b>Tampere</b> <b>Programme</b> (1999 – 2004), leaving off at the beginning of its multi-annual successor agenda, the Hague Programme (2005 – 10). The examination proceeds through a double movement...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{the topic of}} this volume, which is the recent departure from viewing integration as a strictly two-way process (between migrants and the receiving society) to acknowledge the potential role that countries of origin might play {{in support of the}} integration process. It traces the origin of this change in policy perspective, reviewing the Europeanization of immigration and integration policy since the <b>Tampere</b> <b>Programme</b> (1999 - 2004). Indeed, a major shift in policy framing came in 2011, with the renewed European Agenda for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals, which explicitly added the countries of origin as a third key actor in the process of immigrants’ integration, thereby introducing the three-way process in European policy. In addition to tracing the development of European policy on integration, it takes a step back to consider three broad and interconnected issues: (i) the way integration is conceptualized and studied in Europe; (ii) the way integration policies are studied and how the concept of integration is used in policy formulation and practice; and (iii) the way new perspectives and actors (e. g., those in countries of origin) are incorporated in analyses of integration processes and policies. It concludes by introducing the further structure of the volume...|$|E

The examination proceeds through a double movement, surveying and analysing both internally and externally directed policies, as well as their intimate and often contradictory interplay. The paper sets out by scrutinizing supranational initiatives in the field of migrant/minority integration and anti-discrimination,focusing specifically on the strong interaction of this enterprise with labour-market policy and the issues of citizenship, social exclusion, and ‘Europeanvalues’. It then goes on to explore the European Commission’s objectives and assumptions concerning its calls for a sizeable increase in labour migration from third countries. Besides relating this to the internal requirements of the EU’s transforming labour market, it also discusses the external ramifications of the EU’s developing labour migration policy. The remaining sections scrutinize the EU’s emerging asylum policy. It attends, inter alia, to the EU’s ever-widening smorgasbord of restrictive asylum instruments and security-oriented immigration policies, which, as the paper goes on to argue, together serve to transform the right of asylum into a problem of ‘illegal immigration’. Above all, this predicament is discussed in relation to the growing importance of immigration and asylum matters in the EU’s external relations...|$|E
