5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E
5|$|On Allward's {{urging the}} Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission hired Oscar Faber, a Danish {{structural}} engineer, in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general {{supervision of the}} foundation work. Faber had recently designed the substructure for the Menin Gate at Ypres, and he selected a design that employed cast-in-place reinforced concrete to which <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> stone would be bonded. Major Unwin Simson served as the principal Canadian engineer during {{the construction of the}} memorial and oversaw much of the daily operations at the site. Allward moved to Paris in 1925 to supervise construction and the carving of the sculptures. Construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete. The Imperial War Graves Commission concurrently employed French and British veterans to carry out the necessary roadwork and site landscaping.|$|E

30|$|Changes in {{lighting}} conditions mainly lead {{to changes}} in the brightness and contrast of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image. After <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image is transformed, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image are obtained. In order to more accurately analyze the influence of illumination on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image are processed separately. The high-frequency component of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image represents detailed information such as texture and edge, and the high-frequency information of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image is mainly reflected in the position of the eyes, the nose, the lips, the mouth, the wrinkles of <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>the</b> skin color changes. When the brightness and contrast of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> are changed, <b>the</b> low-frequency components of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> change and <b>the</b> high-frequency components change a little. Therefore, when the illumination causes the grayscale of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image to change, <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image is basically unaffected, mainly affecting <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> image is transformed by the wavelet transform multi-resolution feature to realize the separate processing of the low-frequency component and the high-frequency component of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, so that <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image not only contains useful information of face recognition but also avoids the influence of illumination.|$|R

5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
