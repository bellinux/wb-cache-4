5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> still {{unaware that}} this was not the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the {{fighting}} and the number of British troops engaged.|$|E
5|$|Seven of the team's {{head coaches}} {{played for the}} Sabres during their careers: Floyd Smith, Bill Inglis, Jim Schoenfeld, Craig Ramsay, Rick Dudley, Lindy Ruff and Phil Housley. In addition, two others, Ted Nolan and Dan Bylsma, played for the Rochester Americans {{at a time when}} <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> the Sabres' top minor-league affiliate.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{more open}} to negotiating. A rift {{developed}} {{between them and the}} British who, Bauer writes, were worried about large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine, then under British control. There was also concern about the effect of Jewish immigration to the UK or US.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Rambler <b>American</b> <b>is</b> an {{automobile}} manufactured by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Motors Corporation (AMC) between 1958 and 1969. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> second incarnation of AMC's forerunner Nash Motors second-generation Rambler compact that was sold under the Nash and Hudson Motors marques from 1954 and 1955.|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{well aware}} of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{motivated}} Tonelli {{by showing}} {{him the best}} times recorded by American boys of the same age, as documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{returned}} when <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{invited to}} the island by Britain to set up military bases in 1941 to 1945. The American Bases Act became law in Newfoundland on June 11, 1941. As Earle (1998) finds, Newfoundland girls married American personnel by the thousands. In 1948 there was a short-lived but growing movement {{for some sort of}} economic union with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Ticonderoga cannons, {{which were}} of a size and range not {{previously}} available to <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>were</b> emplaced in fortifications around the city, and {{on the night of}} March 2, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> working on the atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} {{the hope that the}} weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} as <b>the</b> North <b>American</b> economy <b>was</b> {{in a recession}} and buyers were looking for smaller and more economical cars and the Rambler brand {{was known as a}} fuel miser. <b>The</b> Rambler <b>American</b> <b>was</b> a yearly winner of the best fuel economy in the Mobil Economy Run and the Pure Oil Company Economy Trials, even during later years when fuel efficiency was not {{a major factor in the}} purchase of automobiles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> {{owned by}} Freedom Communications until 2012, when Freedom papers in Texas {{were sold to}} AIM Media Texas.|$|R
50|$|As an {{afternoon}} paper, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> dependent on street sales rather than subscriptions, {{and it was}} breaking news that brought street sales. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> noted for its aggressive reporting. Its editors, writers, and photographers went hard after every story. It was not uncommon for them {{to pretend to be}} police officers or public officials to get a story, although many of them could simply talk their way into any place.|$|R
5|$|The 49th Pursuit Group {{was soon}} {{on its way}} to fight the Japanese in the South West Pacific. Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed a number of times. The 49th Pursuit Group became its {{principal}} defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> heavily dependent on their Australian allies. Morale was low, but the sight of Wurtsmith's aircraft patrolling the skies provided an important boost.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{alarmed by}} the Japanese buildup, which was {{accurately}} tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by Michael E. DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.|$|E
5|$|The Hessians, in {{the center}} {{under the command of}} General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines {{stationed}} at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan. The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who {{were in the process of}} outflanking the American lines at that time. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E

50|$|While Italian ricotta is {{typically}} {{made from the}} whey of sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> product <b>is</b> almost always made of cow's milk whey. While both types are low in fat and sodium, the Italian version is naturally sweet, while <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>is</b> a little saltier and more moist.|$|R
5|$|The Tripolitan vessel, Tripoli, and Enterprise {{were quite}} evenly matched. Enterprise, with a {{complement}} of 90, was a 12-gun, 135-ton schooner built in 1799 that had seen {{action in the}} Quasi-War. In contrast, Tripoli, a lateen-rigged polacca with two masts, was crewed by 80men under Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous and armed with 14guns. Although the Tripolitans held a slight advantage in firepower, Enterprise had to its advantage the larger crew and the element of surprise. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> also significantly more experienced in gunnery action than the Tripolitans, who preferred to attack by boarding and taking over their opponents' ships.|$|E
5|$|The Vietcong commanders {{had planned}} the venture with twoobjectives in mind. First, by attacking an American {{installation}} {{in the center}} of the heavily guarded capital, the Vietcong intended to demonstrate their ability to strike in South Vietnam should the United States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam. Second, the bombing would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Chambly {{improved}} morale {{in the ranks}} of Montgomery's army, so much so that he went through with his plan to establish a battery north of Fort St. Jean, this time without opposition. While <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> constructing the batteries, the British heavily bombarded the American workers, but this resulted in few casualties. General Guy Carleton, commanding the British forces at Montreal, realized that the situation at Fort St. Jean was becoming desperate. He personally led a relief force at the end of October, but American forces successfully prevented it from crossing the Saint Lawrence River south of Montreal.|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Not at all. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> barbarians. But we are not. I {{suppose the}} {{particular}} barbarian you are speaking of <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> who has invented {{a means of}} breathing under water.|$|R
60|$|Of all men-of-war, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ships <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most {{excessively}} neat, {{and have}} the greatest reputation for it. And of all men-of-war the general discipline of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ships <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most arbitrary.|$|R
5000|$|Guido Salvini said [...] "The role of <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>was</b> ambiguous, {{halfway between}} knowing and not {{preventing}} and actually inducing people to commit atrocities." ...|$|R
5|$|The first {{mission of}} the new {{operation}} was launched on 2 March against an ammunition storage area near Xom Bang. On the same day, 19 VNAF A-1 Skyraiders struck the Quang Khe Naval Base. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> shocked when six of their aircraft were shot down during the mission. Five of the downed crewmen were rescued, {{but it was a}} portent of things to come.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Rio Grande and arriving at Ojo de Agua at approximately 1am, the Mexican raiders attacked the village's garrison. The American {{soldiers who had}} been sleeping in a wooden building stubbornly resisted. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> heavily outgunned, though, as the Signal Corps personnel were armed only with pistols. In the fighting Sergeant Schaeffer was killed, {{and as a result}} command devolved to Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith who by that time had also been wounded three times. In addition to attacking the garrison, the raiders robbed the post office and attacked the home of the Dillard family, setting their house on fire and stealing their livestock.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{product of}} the merger or {{acquisition}} of 14 predecessor newspapers and inherited the tradition and the files of all of them.|$|R
60|$|When Don Benito returned, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>was</b> pained {{to observe}} that his hopefulness, like the sudden {{kindling}} in his cheek, was but febrile and transient.|$|R
