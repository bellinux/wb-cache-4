5|$|After {{extensive}} testimony, Justice Spicer {{ruled on}} November 30 {{that there was}} not enough evidence to indict the men. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. Though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been <b>tarnished.</b> The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of the city Japanese {{soldiers}} massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of looting and rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre. Though Japan's military victory excited and emboldened them, the subsequent massacre <b>tarnished</b> their reputation {{in the eyes of}} the world. Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years.|$|E
5|$|His son {{was also}} {{executed}} {{a few months}} later, and his daughter-in-law suffered for several months in prison before she was released {{in the summer of}} 1794. She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later, Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor. The fate of the family is representative of the fates of many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards <b>tarnished</b> in the Reign of Terror.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tarnish</b> is a {{thin layer}} of {{corrosion}} that forms over copper, brass, silver, aluminum, magnesium and other similar metals as their outermost layer undergoes a chemical reaction. <b>Tarnish</b> does not always result from the sole effects of oxygen in the air. For example, silver needs hydrogen sulfide to <b>tarnish,</b> although it may <b>tarnish</b> with oxygen over time. It often appears as a dull, gray or black film or coating over metal. <b>Tarnish</b> is a surface phenomenon that is self-limiting, unlike rust. Only the top few layers of the metal react, and the layer of <b>tarnish</b> seals and protects the underlying layers from reacting.|$|R
30|$|Silver, prized {{throughout}} history for its luster and shine, develops a black Ag 2 S <b>tarnish</b> layer that is aesthetically displeasing {{when exposed to}} atmospheric pollutants. <b>Tarnishing,</b> and subsequent polishing, leads to irreversible material loss and object damage. Currently, nitrocellulose coatings are often used to prevent silver from <b>tarnishing,</b> however non-uniform coatings and degradation over time limit their effectiveness. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been explored as a new method for creating dense, uniform, and conformal coatings on 3 -dimensional (3 D) objects that are more effective than nitrocellulose in preventing silver from <b>tarnishing.</b>|$|R
500|$|Palladium {{does not}} react with oxygen at {{standard}} temperatures (and thus does not <b>tarnish</b> in air). Palladium heated to 800°C {{will produce a}} layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It <b>tarnishes</b> lightly in a moist atmosphere containing sulfur.|$|R
5|$|The {{trust the}} American people had in him was rapidly and {{severely}} <b>tarnished</b> by his pardon of Nixon.

His subsequent loss to Carter in 1976 has come to be seen as an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation.|$|E
5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously to the news. The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings would just be <b>tarnished</b> forever. United were no longer an independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken {{on the other side}} of the globe.|$|E
5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have faulted Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and set design. Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction of the lead character, Sandy, approval of the film in general has been <b>tarnished</b> due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979). Both Warren and Alien distributors 20th Century Fox have rejected claims that the script of Inseminoid was influenced by that of the earlier film.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tarnish</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction {{on the surface}} of metal (copper, brass, silver, etc.) and causes a layer of corrosion. In the case of silver <b>tarnish,</b> the silver combines with sulfur and forms silver sulfide ( [...] Ag2S [...] ) which is black. The original silver surface can be restored if the layer of silver sulfide is removed. [...] On some metals, <b>tarnish</b> serves as a protective layer known as a patina and is typically found on copper and bronze roofing, architectural elements, statues and bells.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tarnish</b> {{actually}} {{preserves the}} underlying metal in outdoor use, {{and in this}} form is called patina. The formation of patina is necessary in applications such as copper roofing, and outdoor copper, bronze, and brass statues and fittings. Patina is the name given to <b>tarnish</b> on copper based metals.|$|R

The technique allows {{the identification of the}} constituents of the thin <b>tarnishing</b> layers and also its relative abundance. A much more complex composition than the silver sulphide commonly associated with silver <b>tarnish</b> has been found, namely, silver chlorides, silver oxides and minor amounts of silver sulphide on the pure silver, plus copper oxides and a mixed copper-silver sulphide on the sterling silver samples. The <b>tarnishing</b> films were very thin mainly composed by silver chloride and silver oxides layers with thicknesses ranging between 0. 22 and 9. 63 nm...|$|R
5|$|As Leeds manager he was criticised for the {{physical}} and often negative approach of his teams, though the period was noted for its highly physical football across the country. His resignation as England manager fuelled criticism of him as money-obsessed, and unproven allegations of bribery and financial misconduct also <b>tarnished</b> his reputation. He retired in 1984, but was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in May 1987, which led to his death two years later. He remains a highly popular figure in Leeds, and has a stand named after him at Elland Road {{as well as a}} statue outside the ground.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{appointed}} one {{justice to}} the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation <b>tarnished</b> by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone. Stone {{proved to be a}} firm believer in judicial restraint and was {{regarded as one of the}} court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the <b>tarnished</b> plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{chemical}} composition of copper <b>tarnish</b> products formed at 40, 60, and 80 % relative humidity (RH) in an uncontaminated environment, for 21 days experimentation at 30 °C. The experimental method used was X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{in conjunction with}} Ar+-ion sputtering. The main compounds found were cuprite (Cu 2 O) and copper hydroxide [Cu(OH) 2]. Differences were observed between 40, 60, and 80 % RH. Copper specimens exposed to 40 % RH show the thickest <b>tarnish</b> layers, while the thinnest correspond to the 80 % RH specimens. The <b>tarnish</b> layer of the copper specimen exposed to 80 % RH is constituted mainly by copper hydroxide. For the 40 and 60 % RH copper specimens the <b>tarnish</b> layer {{is a mixture of}} copper hydroxide and cuprite. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Having been nominated and rejected in 2000, when the game suffered a <b>tarnished</b> reputation due to match fixing scandals, the captaincy was passed to Dravid, his former deputy. Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to make a comeback to the team. Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution {{in the field of}} sports.

5|$|In 1952, {{while still}} in the hospital, Kesselring {{accepted}} the honorary presidency of three veterans' organisations. The first was the Luftwaffenring, consisting of Luftwaffe veterans. The Verband deutsches Afrikakorps, the veterans' association of the Afrika Korps, soon followed. More controversial was {{the presidency of the}} right-wing veterans' association, the Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten. Leadership of this organisation <b>tarnished</b> his reputation. He attempted to reform the organisation, proposing that the new German flag be flown instead of the old Imperial Flag; that the old Stahlhelm greeting Front heil! be abolished; and that members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany be allowed to join. The response was very unenthusiastic.|$|E

For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1615, however, {{it emerged}} that Overbury had been poisoned. He had died on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London, {{where he had}} been placed at the King's request. Among those convicted of the murder were Frances and Robert Carr, the latter having been {{replaced}} as the king's favourite in the meantime by Villiers. James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr's sentence of death, eventually pardoning him in 1624. The implication of the King in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably <b>tarnished</b> James's court with an image of corruption and depravity. The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619.|$|E
5|$|In the new Taliesin, Wright {{worked to}} repair his <b>tarnished</b> reputation. He secured a {{commission}} to design the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan; when the building was undamaged following the 1923 earthquake, Wright's reputation was restored. Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad. Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works. Wright only truly lived at Taliesin II starting in 1922, after {{his work at the}} Imperial Hotel was completed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tarnish</b> {{films that}} form on copper {{surfaces}} at high humidity can creep over adjoining gold surfaces, causing {{increases in the}} contact resistance of the gold. In many cases, however, when gold-plated contacts having exposed areas of copper are removed from equipment used for {{extended periods of time}} in environments known to contain sulfiding compounds, there has been little or no evidence of creepage. This protection against <b>tarnish</b> is caused by a natural ly formed oxide and has been duplicated in the laboratory. When copper sulfide <b>tarnish</b> films do creep over gold surfaces, distinctive periodic bands are formed. The humidity dependence of the rate and maximum dis-tance of the creepage have been studied.
