5000|$|After {{running through}} the police railblock, the group of four has {{apparently}} jumped off the train. A police force chases the group, until their path is blocked by a helicopter. The group {{turns out to be}} the conductor and others, who explained that the real group of fugitives told them to jump off the train at gunpoint, to keep running, and not to look back. As Michael, Lincoln, Sara, and Kellerman leave the train without incident, Kellerman finds a car, and is again contacted by the president. Kellerman asks her what they did during his 35th birthday. When the voice on the other line cannot answer the question, Kellerman realizes that she is not actually the President. He says, [...] "Hey. Whoever <b>this</b> <b>is</b> ... <b>tell</b> Bill Kim that he just screwed up ... big-time." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this review}} I {{summarize}} the observational attempts {{done so far}} to unveil {{the nature of the}} progenitor system/s of Type Ia Supernovae. In particular, I focus on the most recent developments that followed the alleged detection of circumstellar material around a few events, and on the link this possibly establishes with recurrent novae. In this framework, I then discuss the case of RS Oph, what we know of its circumstellar environment, and what <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> us about its supposed connection to Type Ia supernova explosions.

Yes, they don't indulge in crude forms of casteism – not allowing someone to drink out of the same glass – but will they allow a Dalit to come and sit at their table and eat with them?
