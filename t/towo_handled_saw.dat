40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} gate-to-gate life cycle {{inventory}} for the production of framing lumber from logs in western Oregon and Washington. Dimension lumber and studs are used in the framing of residential structures. A large portion of this type of lumber is Douglas-fir or hemlock. The functional unit is the sawmill complex which produces planed dry lumber from logs. This includes log <b>handling,</b> <b>sawing,</b> drying, planing, and generating steam for the dryer. The system boundary begins with the logs entering the mill complex and ends with products (lumber) or co-products (chips, sawdust, shavings, bark, hog fuel) leaving the mill complex. The burdens for all substances and energy are allocated among the products and co-products based on dry mass. This report is intended for use in developing life cycle inventories for various construction practices in residential housing. Four mills which produced dimension lumber as a primary product were surveyed according to the CORRIM research guidelines. One of these produced only green lumber, one produced only dry lumber, and the other two produced a combination. The annual total production from these mills was 13 percent of the stud and dimension lumber volume produced in the survey region. The mills provided detailed data about the inputs and outputs to their operations for either calendar year 1999 or 2000. Over 99. 5 % of the material inputs and outputs were collected as primary data. An additional ten mills in the region were sampled to obtain steam production and drying data only.
