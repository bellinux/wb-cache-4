This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
500|$|He {{was buried}} in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, {{including}} the hymns, {{was the work of}} the composer. After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: [...] "I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen." [...] Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. It was finally unveiled in 1939.|$|E
500|$|In February–March 1907, Andranik went to Vienna to {{participate}} in the fourth ARF Congress. The ARF, which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902, discussed and approved the negotiations with the Young Turkswho later perpetrated the Armenian Genocideto overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party. In 1908, the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election, but he declined the offer, saying [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and do nothing". Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years.|$|E

500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to write anything following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and embarrassing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and think we could write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E
500|$|To meet {{long-term}} requirements, Alberta Transportation also {{proposes to}} construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound Anthony Henday Dive to northbound Ray Gibbon Drive after the latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway. [...] Ray Gibbon Drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry the Highway2 designation in the future. [...] One kilometre {{further down the road}} at 137Avenue, grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 Alberta elected not to spend $7million to complete paving of the ramps because development did not yet require it. St.Albert mayor Nolan Crouse was unhappy with the decision, stating that his city would not pay for it either. [...] "It's going <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> until there's another plan, and right now we don't have a plan... we have taken the position that we think it's the province's responsibility, and they say they won't," [...] Crouse said. , there is no timeline for completion of the interchange.|$|E
2500|$|Spitz felt snubbed by {{not being}} asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven gold medal record.

2500|$|... "I had {{went through}} {{a lot of things in}} my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, {{painting}} the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my dicision (sic) to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Come Up Show following a recent performance in Canada in April 2011, Method Man replied with this regarding his current 'weed-loving' image: [...] "When you get older and you've got kids and your {{kids are going to}} school and you know [...] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [...] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. [...] "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into {{a cottage}} in Crear, Argyll and Bute, {{they set up}} a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and {{political}} territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, [...] "Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [...] You just have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It's like an old album. It's like the Beatles' Revolver [...] Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful"—Elton John), singles such as [...] "Re-Offender" [...] did very well on the British charts, and the album itself reached No.3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.|$|E

60|$|One {{or two of}} {{the girls}} spoke to him, just a word when things were slack, and he felt they were taking his measure. At five he was sent up again to the dining-room for tea.

60|$|A {{little later}} Hayes {{came up the}} steps. Osborn did not ask him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down, {{although}} <b>there</b> was room on the stone bench, and the agent leaned against the terrace wall. His face was inscrutable but he remarked his employer's rudeness.|$|R

50|$|A {{good example}} of a meydan {{can be seen in}} Ohrid, Macedonia. On two sides of the meydan in Ohrid, there are two mosques.
