I only came into it because of my UDR connection and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun but I had never fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened {{and that was when}} I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 {{interview}} with People, Barr described {{herself as an}} [...] "incest survivor", accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse, claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied. Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, {{said that they had}} passed a lie detector test [...] "with flying colors". Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to deal with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some mental illness... I totally lost touch with reality... (and) I didn’t know what the truth was... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family". She added that not everything was [...] "made up", saying, [...] "Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification". Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years, but had recently reconciled.|$|E
500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] was {{directed}} by Martin Campbell and written by Tom Fontana, executive producer of Homicide: Life on the Street. The interrogation room at the homicide division, colloquially referred to by detectives as [...] "The Box", is a setting that appears in almost every episode of Homicide: Life on the Street. While filming an interrogation scene there in [...] "Gone for Goode", the first episode of the , director Barry Levinson commented to Fontana that the acting from Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor was so effective, an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation. The comments partially inspired Fontana to write [...] "Three Men and Adena". Fontana said, [...] "I only {{had the courage to}} write that episode based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen what (Braugher and Secor) could do in the pilot episode". Almost the entire episode of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] takes place {{within the confines of the}} police interrogation room with Braugher, Secor and Moses Gunn, the actor who guest starred as Risley Tucker. It was Gunn's final acting role before his death in December 1993. Fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only the fifth week of the show, but he said, [...] "It was important for Barry Levinson and I to establish that we weren't going to do the same old show every week." ...|$|E

[...] "And they made a great {{publicity}} point of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack." [...] Later in 1942, when RKO Pictures began promoting its new corporate motto, [...] "Showmanship In Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO", Welles understood it as a reference to him.|$|E
2500|$|... "In 1912... {{the idea}} of {{describing}} the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly interested me. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen chronophotographs of fencers in action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) gave me {{the idea for the}} Nude. It doesn't mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of speed, was in the air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leadbeater {{played for}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a middle-order batsman from 1966 to 1979, {{although}} {{he preferred to}} open the innings. His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century. The highlight of his playing career was a man-of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match {{in which he was}} not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury. Leadbeater said: [...] "I almost forgot about <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a broken finger. Then when it came to lunchtime, I was changing my clothing because of perspiration, and ate my lunch in a jockstrap and left batting glove! I couldn’t get the glove off because my finger had swollen. I can't get m' breath!" [...] Leadbeater posted a top score of 90 in 106 one day games. Leadbeater was touted by Colin Cowdrey (amongst others) as a future Test match cricketer. However, batting lower down the order and a shin injury in 1970 meant that Leadbeater failed to score enough runs to impress the selectors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{spiritual leader}} of the tail section. Director Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one {{with the ability to}} [...] "exude the {{ambience}} of spirituality." [...] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, [...] "He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is," [...] adding, [...] " [...] as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people." [...] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because, [...] " [...] <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches. [...] and having {{to make it look like}} as though I'd been doing it for years." [...] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to [...] "interpret things as we want, as we see fit" [...] as well as adding pointers to the act. Hurt said of Bong, [...] "I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when I got home. I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since." [...] as well as previously adding, [...] "He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something. [...] He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him." ...|$|E
