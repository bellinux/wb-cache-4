5000|$|On October 17, 2013 Howard Gardner {{visited the}} CH-CH campus. According to Dr. Gardner, [...] "when {{something}} is important, {{try to teach}} it lots of different ways...

60|$|He didn't sleep much, {{he was in}} such a sweat <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{find out}} the mystery about Phillips; and {{moreover}} he done a lot of guessing about it all night, which warn't no use, for {{if you are going to}} find out the facts of a thing, what's the sense in guessing out what ain't the facts and wasting ammunition? I didn't lose no sleep. I wouldn't give a dern to know what's the matter of Phillips, I says to myself.|$|E
60|$|One day I was {{listening}} to some conversation upon this subject when an American student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison. I asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness {{to go to jail}} as soon as he conveniently could, so that I might try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> visit him, and see what college captivity was like. He said he would appoint the very first day he could spare.|$|E
60|$|His {{confinement}} was {{to endure}} twenty-four hours. He shortly chose his day, {{and sent me}} word. I started immediately. When I reached the University Place, I saw two gentlemen talking together, and, as they had portfolios under their arms, I judged they were tutors or elderly students; so I asked them in English {{to show me the}} college jail. I had learned to take it for granted that anybody in Germany who knows anything, knows English, so I had stopped afflicting people with my German. These gentlemen seemed a trifle amused--and a trifle confused, too--but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and show me the place. He asked me why I wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I said to see a friend--and for curiosity. He doubted if I would be admitted, but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the fair}} opened, {{a few minutes}} before 5 p.m., Leona Rostenberg {{wondered}} out loud what we had all wondered silently: would our fair attract any visitors at all? Then, before I had realized it, she had ducked outside to see whether anyone had come. When she returned, her face reflected radiance and disbelief. ‘They're standing <b>in</b> line <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in!</b> <b>There</b> are crowds outside!’ Despite rain and storm, the jams of people on opening night filled us with incredulity and exuberance.|$|R

5000|$|Grasshopper was {{throwing}} dead squirrels and rats into a lawnmower when Jonathan met him. The blood spattered over a watching group of retarded kids and they screamed and yelled.

They {{have their own}} secret club, Kid Power, and spend long hours in their clubhouse in the yard fighting imaginary battles as their alter egos the intrepid Shapiro (Emma) and the fearless O'Toole (Noah). They will not allow Jacob into their 'clubhouse', which makes him long <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> all the more.

Being the producer and the artist you'd think it would be really stressful, but for some reason everything went so smoothly. All my close friends were in the video; they're my best girl friends.
