The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009.

In 1958 a Preservation Order was obtained to stop the building being demolished and adding to the growing trend of destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain. Restoration was undertaken by William Rees-Mogg who bought the building in 1964. Peter Smedley bought it from Rees-Mogg in 1977 or 1978 and carried out further restoration and converted it into a hotel. Notoriously he allowed the BBC to film his Dignitas assisted suicide.

5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as <b>the</b> <b>liability</b> the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E

Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it.

5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding <b>the</b> <b>liability</b> for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E

We study two questions: (i) do <b>the</b> <b>liabilities</b> have an important impact on the optimal asset allocation? (ii) do alternative asset classes add value relative to stocks and bonds? We empirically examine these questions using a vector autogression for returns, liabilities and macro-economic state variables. We find {{that the costs of}} ignoring <b>the</b> <b>liabilities</b> in <b>the</b> asset allocation are substantial and increase with the investment horizon. Second, the augmented asset menu adds value from the perspective of hedging <b>the</b> <b>liabilities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Casual Connection as an Element of <b>the</b> Legal <b>Liability</b> Abstract of Dissertation The {{concept of}} the casual {{connection}} is not understood in a uniform manner, although it represents the principal legal institute that enables functioning of the law. However, the nature and purpose of <b>the</b> legal <b>liability</b> in <b>the</b> Czech jurisprudence remains the object of discussions, and this {{is supported by the}} fact that the positive legal regulation uses <b>the</b> concept of <b>liability</b> at random. Within the vindicative concept of <b>the</b> legal <b>liability</b> as <b>the</b> secondary legal <b>liability</b> arising as <b>the</b> result of the violation of <b>the</b> primary legal <b>liability,</b> we can discern several basic elements. It is particularly the violation of <b>the</b> legal <b>liability,</b> <b>the</b> negative consequence consisting in the violation of or a threat to the legal values, as well as the casual connection between the wrongful act and the negative consequence. The causal connection is the principal element of <b>the</b> legal <b>liability</b> which represents <b>the</b> objective element whereby a wrongful act may be attributed to a certain subject. Thus, the causal connection transmits <b>the</b> penal <b>liability</b> to <b>the</b> subject concerned. Mostly, it is not difficult to find the element of violation of <b>the</b> legal <b>liability</b> and <b>the</b> negative consequence. However, the situation is more complicated in the [...] ...|$|R
