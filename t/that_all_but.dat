5|$|On 30 September 1968, Vice Admiral Elmo Zumwalt assumed {{command of}} Naval Forces Vietnam and he {{redirected}} {{the focus of}} interdiction operations conducted by TF115 to areas nearer the DMZ {{as a part of}} Operation Sealords (Southeast Asia Lake, Ocean, River, and Delta Strategy). The result was <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft U.S. Navy PCFs that had been used for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Plains All American Pipeline {{estimated}} that the cleanup had cost $96 million during a joint oversight hearing of the State Assembly Natural Resources Committee and Senate Select Committee on June 26, 2015. Overall expenses related to the spill were estimated to be $257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time. This included the emergency response and cleanup efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements. The CEO stated in the report <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> $65 million would be covered by insurance and that the figure did not include lost revenue from the pipelines that have been shutdown.|$|E
5|$|Stan was {{associated}} with a large area of loosely organized but very heavy shower activity existing over Mexico and Central America during this time. Torrential rainfall in this area caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides which were responsible for at least 1,662 deaths in six countries; 1,500 of these casualties occurred in Guatemala alone. Initially, more than a thousand deaths were attributed to Hurricane Stan, but the National Hurricane Center postulates <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> less than 100 of the deaths were more related to the larger weather event. This was not definitively confirmed in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Stan, though it is certain that only 80-100 deaths resulted from the direct effects of the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{learns that}} she has a {{cancerous}} tumor between her sinus and cerebrum. She initially tells only Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) of the diagnosis, and is determined to continue to work. The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering from similar symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one of the MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E

5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E
5|$|On his deathbed, the King of Fynn tasks {{the party}} to seek {{the help of the}} {{seemingly}} extinct dragoons of Deist. In Deist, the party finds only a mother with her son, learning <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one of the Dragoons are dead, {{partly as a result of}} Imperial poison. After placing an egg of the last wyvern in a cavern, the party returns to Altair and rescues Hilda from the Empire a second time, before successfully reclaiming Fynn from the Imperial forces. They then travel west in search of a powerful magic item, joining forces with the last surviving dragoon on the way. The party returns to Fynn and sees that many towns have been destroyed by a cyclone summoned by the Emperor. The party calls upon the newly born last wyvern to take them to a castle inside the cyclone, where they confront and kill the Emperor. Back at Fynn, everyone celebrates the Empire's defeat, but a mortally wounded Fynn soldier arrives and reveals that Leon has taken the throne and plans to destroy the Rebels with the Imperial army.|$|E

25|$|Tiling {{the plane}} with {{copies of a}} single polyomino has also been much discussed. It was noted in 1965 that all polyominoes up to hexominoes and all but four heptominoes tile the plane. It was then {{established}} by David Bird <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> 26 octominoes tile the plane. Rawsthorne found <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> 235 polyominoes of order 9 tile, and such results have been extended to higher orders by Rhoads (to order 14) and others. Polyominoes tiling the plane have been classified by the symmetries of their tilings and {{by the number of}} aspects (orientations) in which the tiles appear in them.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of the post-World War II downsizing of the U.S. Navy {{and the decline of}} the seaplane and motor torpedo boat in U.S. naval operations meant <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> the newest ships decommissioned in 1946 and 1947. Those that did stay on in service as seaplane tenders decommissioned between the mid-1950s and 1960s, some seeing service in the Korean War (19501953). The last unit did not leave U.S. Navy service until 1973.|$|E
25|$|Brady {{proves that}} Σ(4) = 13 and S(4) = 107. Brady defines two new {{categories}} for non-halting 3-state 2-symbol Turing Machines: Christmas Trees and Counters.

25|$|Although the Herivel tip {{provided}} the Enigma's ring settings, {{it did not}} provide {{other parts of the}} Enigma key: the rotor order and the plugboard settings. A Luftwaffe key at the time chose from 5 rotors, so there were 60 possible rotor orders. In addition, there might be 8 to 10 plugboard connections, which means <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> 6 of the 26 letters are permuted by the plugboard. The codebreakers had to use other methods to find the remaining portions of the Enigma key.|$|E

His best season with the bat saw him fall just four runs short of 1,000 runs. He never made a century, but had scores of 98 and 95 not out. Worst of all, he was struck down by an injury <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> finished his career {{just as he had}} appeared to have reached his peak.|$|E

In fact, two of the persons cited in Santorum's campaign ad actually gave contributions to Santorum in 2006, and one died in 2004. Santorum's campaign countered that those donations were not kept, and had been donated to educational institutions.|$|E
