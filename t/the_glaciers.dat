50|$|Swamp-like canal {{areas and}} streams {{underlie}} <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> <b>The</b> upstream swamp canals feed streams with dry areas between the streams which retard flow of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> Due to this friction <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> is considered stable {{in the short}} term.|$|R
5|$|The {{area was}} formed during the retreat of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> {{during the last}} ice age, which {{produced}} areas of marshland, notably the Sifton Bog (which is actually a fen), {{as well as some}} of the most agriculturally productive areas of farmland in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>glaciers</b> on Mount Rainier can {{generate}} mudflows, through glacial outburst floods {{not associated with}} any eruption. The South Tahoma Glacier generated 30 floods in the 1980s and early 1990s, and again in August, 2015.|$|E

50|$|Meltwater may flow either above <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> (supraglacially), below <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> (subglacially/basally) or as {{groundwater}} in an aquifer below <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> as {{a result}} of the hydraulic transmissivity of the subsoil under <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> If <b>the</b> rate of production exceeds the rate of loss through the aquifer, then water will collect in surface or subglacial ponds or lakes.|$|R
50|$|In a corrie or cirque, the {{bergschrund}} {{is positioned}} at the rear, {{parallel to the}} back wall of the corrie. It is caused by the rotational movement of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> In a longitudinal <b>glacier,</b> <b>the</b> bergschrund is at the top end of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> at a right angle to the flow of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> It is caused by the downwards flow of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{takes about}} 400 years for ice to {{traverse}} {{the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> meaning that <b>the</b> ice {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> is about 400 years old. <b>The</b> <b>glacier</b> routinely calves off icebergs the size of a ten-story building. Where <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> meets <b>the</b> bay, most of the ice is below the waterline, and newly calved icebergs can shoot up quite dramatically, so that ships must keep their distance from the edge of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> in Disenchantment Bay.|$|R
5|$|Aboriginal genetic {{studies suggest}} that the first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia. The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.|$|E

The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the Cowlitz River near Riffe Lake, and the Lewis River.|$|E
5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat {{in the alps}} since 1850, a {{decrease}} of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can be identified.

5|$|At dawn on {{the third}} day, ukukus grouped by {{moieties}} climb <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> on Qullqipunku to retrieve crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable of dealing with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to oral traditions, ukukus from different moieties used to engage in ritual battles on <b>the</b> <b>glaciers,</b> but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers,</b> such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of {{the last}} Ice Age, <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E

50|$|The Icefield Interpretive Centre, closed {{during the}} winter (mid-October to mid-April), stands across from <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> It {{is used as a}} lodge and for ticket sales for {{sightseeing}} on <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> Standard buses transport tourists to <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> edge, where they board specially designed snow coaches for transport over the steep grades, snow and ice part way up <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b>|$|R
5|$|Siberia is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} polar region, owing to the dryness of the winter climate and has glaciers only in the high Altai Mountains, Verkhoyansk Range, Cherskiy Range and Suntar-Khayata Range, plus possibly a few very small glaciers in the ranges near Lake Baikal, which have never been monitored and may have completely disappeared since 1989. Between the years 1952 and 2006, <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2percent. This shrinkage has been primarily in the ablation zone of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers,</b> with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers. The Altai region has also experienced an overall temperature increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last 120years {{according to a report}} from 2006, with most of that increase occurring since the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Sawtooth Mountains {{were last}} {{extensively}} glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the Little Ice Age, which ended around 1850AD. Evidence of past glaciation is {{abundant in the}} Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, {{as well as the}} north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes.|$|E
5|$|The {{advancing}} and retreating {{characteristics of}} <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> in the Glacier Bay are explained {{in simple terms}} as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens {{of water on the}} base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, the glacier advances. When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of calving. Calving is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier, irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.|$|E
5000|$|Castle Rock Glacier {{is in the}} U.S. {{state of}} Montana. <b>The</b> <b>glacier</b> is {{situated}} south of Castle Rock Mountain in the Beartooth Mountains. <b>The</b> <b>glacier</b> terminus is a proglacial lake and <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> extends from 11700 to 11000 ft.|$|R
2500|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{another option}} for creation of erratics as well, rock avalanches onto the upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> (supraglacial). Rock avalanche–supraglacial transport occurs when <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> undercuts a rock face, which fails by avalanche onto the upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> <b>The</b> characteristics of rock avalanche–supraglacial transport includes: ...|$|R
50|$|Looking at <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> {{it is easy}} to see arc-shaped ridges on the ice surface. The {{curvature}} is due to <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> has grown; ice mass {{near the}} midline of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> creep faster than those on either side, causing the curvature. Because Wheeler Peak has a northeast-facing headwall, it has perennial snow, and is able to protect <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> from <b>the</b> sun.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recorded history}} of the Glacier Bay area starts with the 1741 Russian expedition of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov. La Perouse (after whom one of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> in the bay was named subsequently) established contact with the local inhabitants, the Tlingits at Lutya Bay, in 1786. This {{was followed by the}} Russians staking their claim to the region.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by <b>the</b> <b>glaciers.</b> The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{key to the}} PTAAGMB {{model is}} <b>the</b> <b>glacier’s</b> area-altitude distribution, which is simply <b>the</b> <b>glacier’s</b> surface area as a {{function}} of elevation. The AA profile is a unique feature of a glacier that has been shaped by thousands of years of erosion of the bedrock underlying <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> area altitude distribution has embedded within it the past climate history that has formed <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zemu Glacier {{remains a}} less studied and {{monitored}} glacier. Studying digital imagery shows that <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> has receded 27 meters every year between 1967-1984. The retreat is not massive given the great length of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> There is {{a thick layer}} of debris on <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> preventing ablation: there are, however, small lakes that have formed on the surface of these debris-covered sections of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> front {{had only}} receded by 12 m since the 2007 measurement. The slower melting is {{explained}} by <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> being completely on dry land. The winter of 2007-2008 saw an increase in glacier mass, which was expected to move <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> front forward around 2010. This was confirmed {{in the fall of}} 2010, when measurements showed that <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> had advanced 8 metres over the last year This was however in comparison with the 2009 measurements, which saw <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> being <b>the</b> most receded since measurements started in 1900.|$|R
