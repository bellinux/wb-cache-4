5|$|Although Uncle Tupelo {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for {{its impact on the}} alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred <b>to</b> <b>Middle</b> America and the working class of Belleville.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E

5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic order, Coleoptera, {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (to bite), leading <b>to</b> <b>Middle</b> English betylle. Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in names such as cockchafer, from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Stegosaurus is uncertain, as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their {{ancestors}} are known.

The earliest stegosaurid (the genus Lexovisaurus) is known from the Oxford Clay Formation of England and France, giving it an age of early <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> Callovian.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} of the {{campaign}} the Bf110s switched from bomber escort to ground-attack since the Polish Air Force was all but defeated. In this capacity Lent and Kubisch destroyed a twin-engined monoplane on the ground on 5 September and another aircraft, a PZL P.24, on 9 September. On 12 September 1939 he was attacked by a Polish aircraft which shot out his starboard engine. Lent made a forced landing behind German lines. He flew five more missions during the Polish campaign, destroying one anti-aircraft battery. For his actions in the Polish campaign Lent was awarded {{one of the first}} Iron Cross 2nd Class of World WarII on 21 September 1939. I./ZG76 relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had been at war with Germany since 3 September 1939. From early October <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> December I./ZG76 operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr areas before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939.|$|E
5|$|By 50 BC Greek geographers {{were using}} {{equivalents}} of Prettanikē {{as a collective}} name for the British Isles. However, with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term Britannia {{was used for the}} island of Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of Caledonia, although the people of Caledonia and the north were also the self same Britons during the Roman period, the Gaels arriving four centuries later. Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the island of Great Britain was left open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors such as Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons and Jutes from Continental Europe, who gained control in areas around the south east, and <b>to</b> <b>Middle</b> Irish-speaking people migrating from what is today Northern Ireland to the north of Great Britain (modern Scotland), founding Gaelic kingdoms such as Dál Riata and Alba, which would eventually subsume the native Brittonic and Pictish kingdoms and become Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|Indications {{are that}} society in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived <b>to</b> <b>middle</b> age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.|$|E
