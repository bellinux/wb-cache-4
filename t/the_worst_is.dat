In the same way, moral evil, or vice, is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer.

There was no star quality about them at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|But in 1950, on his seventy-sixth birthday, an astrologer wrote Schoenberg a note warning {{him that}} the year was a {{critical}} one: 7 + 6 = 13 (Nuria Schoenberg-Nono, quoted in [...] ).

He died on Friday, 13 July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45pm, 15 minutes before midnight [...] In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, [...] "About a quarter to twelve I looked at the clock and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> over.
