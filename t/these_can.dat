5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulance}} – The {{most common}} type of ambulance, which provide care to patients with an acute illness or injury. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> be road-going vans, boats, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft (known as air ambulances) or even converted vehicles such as golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Fixed-wing {{aircraft}} – <b>These</b> <b>can</b> be {{used for}} either acute emergency care in remote areas (such as in Australia, with the 'Flying Doctors'), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country), or transportation between distant hospitals.

5|$|In addition, larger organs may use unison off couplers, {{which prevent}} the stops pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> be used in combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, and {{can also be used}} to rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|E

The {{chemicals}} in crude oil are mostly hydrocarbons that contains toxic chemicals such as benzenes, toluene, poly-aromatic hydrocarbon and oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. <b>These</b> chemicals <b>can</b> introduce {{adverse health effects}} when being inhaled into human body. In addition, <b>these</b> chemicals <b>can</b> be oxidized by oxidants in the atmosphere to form fine particulate matter after they evaporate into the atmosphere. <b>These</b> particulates <b>can</b> penetrate lungs and carry toxic chemicals into the human body.|$|R
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. <b>These</b> <b>can</b> vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed, though <b>these</b> <b>can</b> be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{advances}} in genetic engineering led to developments in crops.
