50|$|Some high {{production}} firearms (such as the PPS-43, MP-40, and the Zastava M70B) {{make use}} of metal stocks {{in order to have}} a strong, <b>thin</b> <b>stock</b> that can be folded away in order to make the weapon more compact. It should be noted that even a skeletal steel stock is often heavier than the equivalent wooden fixed stock. Consequentially, less cost-sensitive designs like the FN Minimi {{make use of}} aluminium or lighter-than-steel alloys. A few designs, like the Accuracy International Arctic Warfare, use a metal chassis which securely beds the components of the firearm, with non-structural synthetic panels attached for ergonomics.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the long memory property of stock index returns in 14 markets with diverse levels of development. While the sample includes the developed stock markets of Japan, UK and USA, it also includes, {{in addition to}} the emerging markets of Brazil, India and Mexico, those of eight Arab countries as benchmarks of thin markets with the aim of investigating the link between fractional integration dynamics in stock returns and the level of stock market development. Using parametric and semi-parametric estimation procedures, the results show that the property of long-range dependence in stock index returns tend to be associated with relatively <b>thin</b> <b>stock</b> markets. Evidence from the Arab countries seems to suggest that long-memory might also be linked to the peculiar characteristics and the environment within which each stock market operates. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{explore how}} Korea's {{financial}} structure affects {{the volatility of}} asset prices. Documented empirical evidence {{of the relationship between}} financial structure and financial crisis, sheds light on the relationship between asset price volatility - extreme variations in price - and financial structure. And the volatility of financial and non-financial asset prices provides an indirect link between an economy's financial structure and the likelihood of financial crisis. Using time-series data on a se of indicators measuring financial structure, the authors examine how Korea's financial structure affects the volatility of the real effective exchange rate, the money market rate, government bond yields, and stock prices. They find: 1) There is a stable long-term relationship between financial structure and volatility in the real effective exchange rate, the money market rate, stock prices, and the yield on government housing bonds. 2) Financial structure affects asset price variables asymmetrically. Some variables'volatility increases, and others'diminish, suggesting that monetary policies should target different asset markets to achieve different goals. If the goal of the monetary authority is to stabilize the money market rate, for example, intervening in the banking sector is more efficient than intervening in other financial sub-sectors. 3) The higher volatility of stock prices reflects the <b>thin</b> <b>stock</b> market in Korea. 4) The stability of the yield on government housing bonds reflects the Korean government's policy of stabilizing the nation's housing supply by isolating the housing market from the impact of Korea's financial structure. 5) Restrictions on foreigners'ownership of domestic stock in Korea during the periodanalyzed, and the fact that most capital flows through commercial banks, affect the exchange rate, which is determined (at least in the short run) by capital flows in the foreign exchange market.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the optimal trading system for less actively traded stocks. Several studies have examined the quality and performance of alternative market structures for actively traded stocks. However, very few empirical studies compare the performance of different market structures for less actively traded (i. e., “thinly-traded”) stocks. In 1997 the Italian Stock Exchange (ISE) implemented the <b>Thin</b> <b>Stocks</b> Project to improve market quality of “thinly-traded ” stocks. Under this project, stocks defined as “thinly-traded ” by the ISE were given the option to trade either on a pure order driven market with limit order book (POD), or a hybrid order driven market with specialist and limit order book (HOD). In this paper we compare the relative performance of the two trading systems for “thinly-traded ” stocks using several metrics of market quality. We find that the hybrid order driven system offers superior performance along several quality metrics. In particular, the hybrid order driven system offers lower execution costs, greater depth, significant increase in the depth-to-spread ratio, and a decrease in adverse selection cost. Very illiquid stocks benefit more from adopting a hybrid system than moderately illiquid ones. The results are robust to different measures of execution costs, sampling periods, and modeling approaches. Our findings support the analysis by Grossman and Miller (1988) that a specialist can enhance liquidity of “thinly-traded” stocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{baseline}} non-contacting finger seal is a NASA patented design. The primary {{difference between}} it and Gul Aroras design patented by AlliedSignal {{is that there are}} no lift pads on the high pressure fingers. The baseline non-contacting finger seal is comprised of a back plate, aft spacer, aft (or low pressure) finger element, forward (or high pressure) finger element, forward spacer, and front plate. The components are held together with 20 flat head screws. A typical seal would have a back plate of approximately the same thickness as the front plate and would be riveted together. The thicker back plate allows use of threaded fasteners so that different finger elements can be tested without having to replace all the individual seal components. The finger elements are essentially washers made of <b>thin</b> sheet <b>stock</b> with multiple curved slots machined around the inner diameter to form the fingers. They are clocked so that the fingers of one cover the slots of the other. The aft finger element fingers have axial extensions or "lift pads" at the seal id that are concentric to the rotor.
