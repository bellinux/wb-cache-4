5000|$|If {{the entire}} deck is used during play, the <b>top</b> <b>discard</b> is set aside {{and the rest}} of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then {{proceeds}} normally.|$|E
50|$|Each {{player is}} dealt 12 cards, the {{remaining}} stock pile {{is set on}} the table. Jokers and red Aces are wild. After a card is drawn, one must be discarded, and the next player to the left has the option of drawing either the <b>top</b> <b>discard</b> or top stock card then he must discard.|$|E
50|$|Each {{player is}} dealt 21 cards, the {{remaining}} stock pile is {{spread on the}} table, and the player {{to the left of}} the dealer draws the top card from the stock pile to make melds. After a card is drawn, one must be discarded, and the next player to the left has the option of drawing either the <b>top</b> <b>discard</b> or top stock card. Then he must discard.|$|E
50|$|The next card played must be of {{the same}} suit or the same value as the card on the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile. If a 7 of spades was on the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile, the player can play a 9 of spades or a 7 of clubs. Alternatively, an Ace or Joker can be played. If the player cannot play a card, he must draw from the deck.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. The pluck: drawing one {{card from}} the top card of the face-down stock or the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile; ...|$|R
50|$|The cards {{played into}} the discard piles must be {{played out in}} reverse order of them being laid down - in other words you may not play {{out of the middle}} of the piles but you must remove cards from the <b>top</b> of <b>discard</b> piles when putting them into the playing piles.|$|R
50|$|The top card of {{the deck}} is turned over to start the discard pile. A player takes a turn by taking the top card from either the deck or the discard pile, then {{discarding}} one from their rack and inserting the new card in its place. A player who draws the top card from the deck may immediately discard it; however, when a player takes the <b>top</b> <b>discard,</b> they must put it in their rack and discard a different one.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Allow the call. The player whose turn it is {{gives the}} <b>top</b> <b>discard</b> to {{the player who}} called it. The calling player takes the discard and must also draw one penalty card from the stock, but cannot lay down any cards or discard at this time. The caller will from now on have two extra cards in their hand. The play then reverts to the player whose turn was {{interrupted}} by the call, who must now draw from the stock, and continue the turn in the usual way.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{player is}} dealt 7 cards, and the {{remaining}} stock pile is spread on the table. The top card of the deck is then turned face up to start the discard pile, and the player {{to the left of}} the dealer draws the top card from the stock pile or discard pile to make combinations of three or four-card [...] "lays", e.g. three of a kind, four of a kind, a three straight flush or a four card straight flush. Aces can be played either low (for Ace-Deuce-Three) or high (for Queen-King-Ace straight flush), and Jokers are wild. After a card is drawn, one must be discarded, and the next player to the left has the option of drawing either the <b>top</b> <b>discard</b> or top stock card, then he must discard.|$|E
50|$|Calçots are grilled until charred, {{wrapped in}} {{newspaper}} to steam, then consumed by peeling off the charred skin and dipping the white portion in salvitxada or romesco sauce. The green <b>tops</b> are <b>discarded.</b> The calçots {{are accompanied by}} red wine or cava sparkling wine. Pieces of meat and bread slices are roasted in the charcoal after cooking the calçots.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that one}} cannot {{put down a}} meld or {{condition}} (and/or collect chip payments) unless he can use {{the top of the}} stock or the <b>top</b> of the <b>discards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After that, one card must be {{discarded}} from the player's hand {{and placed on}} <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile face up, so that the player always has seven cards in their hand.|$|R
50|$|When the discard pile is frozen, {{a player}} {{can only take}} it if they hold in their hand two natural cards of the same rank as the top card of the discard pile, and use these with the <b>top</b> <b>discard</b> to make a meld. This meld can either be a new one, or could be the same rank as an {{existing}} meld, {{in which case the}} melds are then merged. For example, if the pile were frozen and the player already has a meld of four Jacks on the table. If the previous player discards a Jack, the next player cannot pick up the discard pile unless they have two Jacks concealed in their hand. If they do have two Jacks in their hand, they can add them and the discarded Jack to their meld (making a Canasta), and take the rest of the discard pile.|$|E
50|$|Under certain conditions, {{instead of}} drawing from the {{distribution}} stack, players {{are permitted to}} take the whole discard pile. In order to do this, players {{must be able to}} meld the <b>top</b> <b>discard.</b> The top card and only the top card with at least two cards from their hand, must be used to make the meld. Or, if a player already has a meld of cards of the same type as the discard, except wild cards, they may pick up the discard pile and use the top card. Afterward, the meld any of the other cards from the discard pile may be used in current melds or to make new melds. Players can pick up the discard pile if they have a natural card of the same value as the top card and one wild card (unless the discard pile is frozen), melding the top card with the natural card and wild card from their hand.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, after any melds or lay offs, {{the player}} must discard a single card to the discard pile, face up. If the player drew from the discard pile {{instead of the}} stock on this turn, they may not replace the same card on <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile but must discard a {{different}} card.|$|R
50|$|Play {{begins with}} the player on the dealer's left and {{proceeds}} clockwise. On their turn, each player draws the top card from the stock or the discard pile. The player may then meld or lay off, which are both optional, before discarding a single card to the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile to end their turn.|$|R
5000|$|Pedro Ramirez = Tuco Ramirez - The Ugly in {{the film}} The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Fictional person) - During phase 1 of his turn, he may choose to draw the first card from the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile or from the deck. Then he draws the second card from the deck. (4 life points) ...|$|R
5000|$|If a {{wild card}} or a black three is on <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile, {{it may not be}} picked up. Playing a black three does not freeze the pile, however; it just acts as a [...] "stop card". The card {{discarded}} after a black three allows the pile to be picked up again (unless it is {{a wild card}}).|$|R
5000|$|Discard All - Play {{this card}} when a player wants to discard {{all of the}} cards in your hand of the same color. For example, if a yellow “7” is in the Discard pile, one may discard all the yellow cards in your hand, with a yellow Discard All card placed on top. (you may also discard a Discard All card on the <b>top</b> of another <b>Discard</b> All card.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The player {{may then}} make as many legal melds {{as they wish}} from the cards in their hand. A turn ends when the player {{discards}} one card from their hand to the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile. No player may [...] "undo" [...] a meld or laid card, or change their mind after drawing a card from the deck if they decide {{that they could have}} taken the discard pile.|$|R
50|$|A {{player can}} play several cards {{of the same}} rank {{together}} in series, for example if a heart is on <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile they could play the ace of hearts and the ace of leaves on top of it. The two aces would mean the next two players miss their turns. In some versions {{it is not possible}} for players to defend against an ace as they don't have a turn.|$|R
30|$|Logging {{practices}} contributed {{greatly to}} the spread and severity of early settlement forest fires. Logging practices in those days left all slash (tree limbs, <b>tops,</b> and <b>discarded</b> parts) on site, which greatly increased surface fuels. As a result, settler-ignited fires {{were much more likely}} to result in severe effects to the forest than fires before settlement commenced (Sudworth 1900, Leiberg 1902). Organized, active suppression of fires in California began after the establishment of Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant national parks in 1890, the first Forest Reserves in 1892, and the Forest Service in 1905 (Cermak 2005, van Wagtendonk 2007). As a result, most fire history studies show a dramatic decrease in fires after about 1900 throughout the Sierra Nevada (Kilgore and Taylor 1979, Caprio and Swetnam 1995, Taylor 2000, Collins and Stephens 2007, Scholl and Taylor 2010).|$|R
5000|$|The {{player to}} dealer's {{left is the}} first to play, and the play moves clockwise. When it is his turn, a player draws one of two cards. He can draw the top card from the discard pile or the top card {{from the top of the}} deck. Then the player must discard one card from his hand and place that card on <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile to {{conclude}} his turn. if a player goes out and it is false it is +20 points ...|$|R
50|$|In each player's turn, {{they may}} play a card of either the same suit or the same rank as the card on the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile, or an eight or nine, which are {{considered}} wild cards. If a player cannot play any cards, then they must draw one card from the stock and play then proceeds to the next player. An exception to this style of play happens during the count, which is explained in further detail lower. Following each card's play, its action is taken before the next player has their turn.|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{patch test}} unit made front {{aluminum}} discs obtained′ from the <b>tops</b> of <b>discarded</b> injection vials and adhesive plaster was found suitable after testing: 8430 chambers in 471 patients. This patch test unit is cheap {{and can be}} easily prepared in a side laboratory. The discs can be resued after washing and drying and disc material has no cross-reactivity with nickel. The large number of -antigens (up to 40) can be tested on the upper back in one sitting The tight occlusion prevents {{the spread of the}} reaction beyond the patch test site. Micio-cuts 1 - 2 in number without subjective discomfort, were produced in iipt 6 5 % of the chambers and these healed without medication in′ 2 - 3 days. There was no, spill-over of petrolatum based antigens, However, with, aqueous antigens the spill over occurred in up to 2 % chambers. The above limitations can be minimized by close scrutiny of the chambers for sharp edges before use and by applying measured quantity of the aqueous antigen...|$|R
50|$|Early {{models of}} the {{ejection}} seat were equipped with only an overhead ejection handle which doubled in function by forcing the pilot to assume the right posture and by having him pull a screen down to protect both his face and oxygen mask from the subsequent air blast. Martin Baker added a secondary handle {{in the front of}} the seat to allow ejection even when pilots weren't able to reach upwards because of high g-force. Later (e.g. in Martin Baker's MK9) the <b>top</b> handle was <b>discarded</b> because the lower handle had proven easier to operate and the technology of helmets had advanced to also protect from the air blast.|$|R
50|$|Play {{consists}} {{of taking a}} card {{from the top of}} the stock, or the <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile. Once a player touches the stack, they are not allowed to then use the discard pile instead.The card must be used in a valid meld (which must be placed on the table) or immediately discarded (unlike other rummy-style games, you cannot add the card to your hand and discard another). If a card is discarded that fits an open meld, that card must be used (Forcing). Discards which play on the next players melds may be forced onto the next player if they were picked from the stack rather than being discarded from a players hand.|$|R
50|$|Elephants are {{classified}} as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg of plant matter per day. They are generalist feeders, and both grazers and browsers. In a study area of 1130 km2 in southern India, elephants were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, and the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families. They graze on the tall grasses, but the portion consumed varies with season. When the new flush appears in April, they remove the tender blades in small clumps. Later, when grasses are higher than 0.5 m, they uproot entire clumps, dust them skilfully and consume the fresh leave <b>tops,</b> but <b>discard</b> the roots. When grasses are mature in autumn, they clean and consume the succulent basal portions with the roots, and discard the fibrous blades. From the bamboos, they eat seedlings, culms and lateral shoots. During the dry season from January to April, they mainly browse on both leaves and twigs preferring the fresh foliage, and consume thorn bearing shoots of acacia species without any obvious discomfort. They feed on the bark of white thorn and other flowering plants, and consume the fruits of wood apple, tamarind, kumbhi and date palm.|$|R
50|$|Each bean card {{carries a}} list of how many beans of that type are {{needed in order to}} obtain one, two, three and four coins when {{harvesting}} a field. To harvest a field, a player counts the beans in it and consults the list to determine the largest amount of coins he or she can obtain from them. (If not enough beans were harvested, this may end up being none at all.) The player places that many of the cards face down in his or her treasury (each card has a coin on the back). The rest of the cards go on <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile, face up. Because some of the cards are set aside as coins, the number of cards in the deck becomes fewer with each reshuffle (in practice, the first reshuffle marks approximately halfway through the game).|$|R
50|$|The {{player to}} the left of the dealer plays first, and then the turn to play passes clockwise. A basic turn {{consists}} of drawing two cards from the top of the distribution stack, adding them to their hand without showing it to the other players. After drawing, but before discarding, players may sometimes be able to play some cards from their hand face up on the table. To play cards to the table in this way is known as melding, and the sets of three cards or more, so played, are melds. These melded cards remain face up on the table until the end of the play. Melding to make Canastas is the object of the game, making as many Canastas as possible. Discarding one card from a players hand face up on <b>top</b> of the <b>discard</b> pile completes each player's turn.|$|R
50|$|First, {{the deck}} is dealt into five piles: two piles of eleven cards and three piles of ten. The player first turns the first pile up and looks for either an ace, a ten, a king, a queen, and a jack, cards which {{comprise}} a royal flush. Once such a card is found, the search ends there, with the cards on <b>top</b> of it <b>discarded</b> and those under it left alone. The search then proceeds {{into the next}} pile {{and the search for}} other cards in the royal flush continues. Also, the suit of the first card found determines the suit of the entire royal flush. When a pile contains no card of the royal flush being searched, the entire pile is discarded. When another royal-flush card is found in a pile, the search continues until all five piles are searched and royal-flush cards are {{at the top of their}} piles.|$|R
500|$|Some animals, {{previously}} {{present in}} abundance, have disappeared, or the populations declined, through habitat loss. By 1912, after the forests had been clearcut, Quehanna {{was covered by}} [...] "vast expanses of brush, created when the root systems of cut-off trees sprouted up through the <b>discarded</b> <b>tops</b> and limbs of the logged forest". Once the forest fires were controlled, this brush offered habitat for many game species. By the early 1940s, the CCC had thinned brush in many areas, and the forest had matured. Shade from the canopy decreased brush in the understory. By the early 21st century, many of the trees in Quehanna were 80 to 100 years old, and the maturation of the forests led to the disappearance of species like bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare; white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, black squirrel, and cottontail rabbit all became less common. Efforts by the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association (MCSA) to reintroduce bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasant, and snowshoe hare have been unsuccessful.|$|R
5000|$|Pellet fuels (or pellets) are {{biofuels}} {{made from}} compressed organic matter or biomass. [...] Pellets {{can be made}} from any one of five general categories of biomass: industrial waste and co-products, food waste, agricultural residues, energy crops, and virgin lumber. [...] Wood pellets are {{the most common type of}} pellet fuel and are generally made from compacted sawdust and related industrial wastes from the milling of lumber, manufacture of wood products and furniture, and construction. Other industrial waste sources include empty fruit bunches, palm kernel shells, coconut shells, and tree <b>tops</b> and branches <b>discarded</b> during logging operations. So-called [...] "black pellets" [...] are made of biomass, refined to resemble hard coal and were developed to be used in existing coal-fired power plants. Pellets are categorized by their heating value, moisture and ash content, and dimensions. They can be used as fuels for power generation, commercial or residential heating, and cooking. [...] Pellets are extremely dense and can be produced with a low moisture content (below 10%) that allows them to be burned with a very high combustion efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|To acquire {{cards from}} the lawn, a player must first {{make it to}} the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or the player's normal roll. Then they have to prove they have that type of card by showing it and then {{flipping}} over the card they want. If they are correct, they take the card. If they are incorrect, they must put down the card they thought it was and take the wrong card. For one player to take from another, they must be on the same space as each other or in the same room. A player challenges another player's card by first proving that they have one of its set. If they do have the card, they must give it to the player or they can give them a [...] "No Clue" [...] card and this card is removed from the game. If {{they do not have the}} card, they are then able to challenge that player for a card with the same rules applying. The player's turn ends after this. To get a card from a room, they must first {{make it to the}} room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through the regular roll. Then they pick up the <b>top</b> card and <b>discard</b> the same card or another card if applicable into the lawn.|$|R
40|$|Various {{methods for}} the {{production}} of bioethanol using different feedstocks have been researched on. In most work on bioethanol synthesis from sugar cane, tops and leaves have been regarded as waste and generally removed and thrown away. In this work, lignocellulosic sugarcane leaves and <b>tops</b> were not <b>discarded</b> but instead used as biomass to evaluate their hydrolyzate content. The leaves and tops were hydrolysed using different methods, namely concentrated acid, dilute acid pre-treatment with subsequent enzyme hydrolysis and compared with a combination of oxidative alkali pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis. Subsequent fermentation of the hydrolyzates into bioethanol was done using the yeast saccharomyces cerevisae. Acid hydrolysis has the problem of producing inhibitors, which have to be removed and this was done using overliming with calcium hydroxide and compared to sodium hydroxide neutralization. Oxidative alkali pre-treatment with enzyme hydrolysis gave the highest yields of fermentable sugars of 38 % (g/g) using 7 % (v/v) peroxide pre-treated biomass than 36 % (g/g) for 5 % (v/v) with the least inhibitors. Concentrated and dilute acid hydrolysis each gave yields of 25 % (g/g) and 22 % (g/g) yields respectively although for acid a neutralization step was necessary and resulted in dilution. Alkaline neutralization of acid hydrolyzates using sodium hydroxide resulted in less dilution and loss of fermentable sugars as compared to overliming. Higher yields of bioethanol, 13. 7 (g/l) were obtained from enzyme hydrolyzates than 6. 9 (g/l) bioethanol from dilute acid hydrolyzates. There was more bioethanol yield 13. 7 (g/l) after 72 h of fermentation with the yeast than 7. 0 (g/l) bioethanol after 24 h. However, the longer fermentation period diminishes the value of the increase in yield by lowering the efficiency of the process...|$|R
