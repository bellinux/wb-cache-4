5|$|Although writing first {{appeared}} during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear until about 2600 BC, at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Old Kingdom.

Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.|$|E
