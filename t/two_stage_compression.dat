40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engine (ICE) fuel efficiency is {{a balance between}} good indicated efficiency and mechanical efficiency. High indicated efficiency is reached with a very diluted air/fuel-mixture and high load resulting in high peak cylinder pressure (PCP). On the other hand, high mechanical efficiency is obtained with very low peak cylinder pressure as the piston rings and bearings {{can be made with}} less friction. This paper presents studies of a {{combustion engine}} which consists of a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compression</b> and expansion cycle. By splitting the engine into two different cycles, high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) cycles respectively, it is possible to reach high levels of both indicated and mechanical efficiency simultaneously. The HP cycle is designed similar to today's turbo-charged diesel engine but with an even higher boost pressure, resulting in high PCP. To cope with high PCP, the engine needs to be rigid. The usage of higher piston ring tension and larger bearings are examples of measures to cope with higher PCP. These measures will cost in terms of friction. Hence, mechanical efficiency is not as good as other engine concepts with lower PCP. The low-pressure cycle on the other hand, uses a design more similar to current naturally aspirated (NA) spark ignited (SI) engines, but designed for even lower PCP. Because of this, the engine {{does not need to be}} as rigidly designed and the overall friction levels will be much lower. By combining these two engine philosophies, a total engine concept with both high indicated and mechanical efficiencies can be achieved. Simulations show net indicated efficiency above 60 % and a brake efficiency of 56 %...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{opportunities for}} use of CO 2 as refrigerant in the air conditioning system in public trains. The CO 2 system shall provide cooling {{in the summer and}} heating in the winter. CO 2 is a natural fluid which means that it exists naturally in the biosphere. Today 75 % of the air conditioning systems in trains use R 134 a as refrigerant. The GWP of R 134 a is 1410 while CO 2 used as refrigerant is 0. A replacement from R 134 a to CO 2 gives possibilities of large environmental savings. Three different technical system solutions of the heat pump are presented, each with its own method of provide cooling and heating. Solution I changes between cooling and heating by change the direction of the refrigerant flow through the system. Solution II changes between cooling and heating by change the configuration of the air streams through the heat exchangers. In Solution III the refrigerant flow direction and the configurations of the air streams is always the same. The whole heat pump is placed on a rotatable unit and the change between cooling and heating is done by rotating the whole heat pump 180 °. In all the three technical solutions there are separated heat exchangers for fresh and exhaust air. This gives an energy efficient system which recover heat from the exhaust air. Computer simulation shows that a system solution with one evaporation pressure and one stage compression is problematic for low ambient temperatures; the system must stand temperatures to 40 °C. A system solution with two levels on the evaporation pressure and a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compression</b> showed to improves the COP from 1, 7 to 3, 2 when the ambient temperature at 40 °C. A railway coach need cooling when the ambient temperature is above 20 °C and heating below 15 °C. Norway is a country with cold climate. Weather statistic show that a train which drives in Oslo every day from 0600 to 1800 throughout a year will need cooling 3 % of the time and heating 83 % the time. This heating should be done by a heat pump and not with electrical heating as today. Results of the computer simulation shows that the annual energy consumption of heating the train will be reduced by 78 % if the designed CO 2 heat pump is used in stead of electrical heating. </p...|$|E

At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch.

40|$|Hard x-ray Free {{electron}} lasers (FEL) {{are being}} built or proposed at many accelerator laboratories as it supports wide range of applications in many aspects. Most of the hard x-ray FEL design is similar with the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), which features a <b>two</b> (or multiple) <b>stage</b> bunch <b>compression.</b> For {{the first stage of}} the bunch compression, usually the beam is accelerated in a lower-frequency RF section (such as S-band for LCLS), and then the longitudinal phase space is linearized by a higher-frequency RF section (harmonic RF, such as X-band for LCLS). In this paper, a compact hard x-ray FEL design is proposed, which is based on X-band RF acceleration and eliminating the need of a harmonic RF. The parameter selection and relation is discussed, and the longitudinal phase space simulation is presented. The FEL coherence condition of the electron beam in the undulators requires a large charge density, a small emittance and small energy spread. The RMS electron bunch length from the injector is in the ps scale, with a bunch charge in the range of hundreds pC to several nC, which means that the current is roughly 0. 1 kA. According to the requirement from soft x-ray lasing and hard x-ray lasing, a peak current of 1 kA and 3 kA is needed respectively. Thus the bunch has to be compressed. Usually a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> bunch <b>compression</b> or multipole <b>stage</b> bunch <b>compression</b> is adopted. The z-correlated energy chirp is normally established by letting the beam pass through a section of RF cavities, with a RF phase off crest. As stated above, S-band RF (3 GHz) acceleration could be applied in this section. Due to the nature of RF acceleration wave, the chirp on the bunch is not linear, but has the RF curvature on it. In order to linearize the energy chirp, a harmonic RF section with higher frequency is needed. For LCLS a short X-band RF section (12 GHz) is used which is a fourth order harmonic. The linearized bunch is then passing by a dispersive region, in which the particles with different energy have different path length. A four dipole chicane is the natural choice for the dispersive region. As the example illustrated in Figure 1, the head of the bunch has smaller energy, and gets a stronger bending kick from the dipole magnet, then has a longer path length in the dispersive region. Similarly, the tail of the bunch has larger energy and shorter path length in the dispersive region. At the exit of the dispersive region, the relative longitudinal position of the head and tail of the bunch both move {{to the center of the}} bunch, so the bunch length will be shorter...|$|R

The heat transfer performance of a compact evaporator is often the bottleneck in sub-ambient heat removal. For this reason, the design of a deep sub-ambient compact evaporator is critical to the cooling system performance and has not been addressed in the literature. Four compact evaporator designs were investigated as feasible designs - a baseline case with no enhancement structures, micro channels, inline pin fin arrays, and alternating pin fin arrays. A parametric experimental investigation of four compact evaporator designs has been performed aiming at enhancing heat transfer. Each evaporator consists of oxygen free copper and has a footprint of 20 mm x 36 mm, with a total thickness of 3. 1 mm. The micro channel evaporator contains 13 channels that are 400 um wide by 1. 2 mm deep, and the pin fin evaporators contain approximately 80 pin fins that are 400 um wide by 1. 2 mm tall with a pitch of 800 um. Two phase convective boiling of R 508 b refrigerant was investigated in each evaporator at flow rates of 50 - 70 g/min and saturation temperatures of ??to ??C.

In air-condition mode, there is an option for cooling of the compressor first stage discharge gas. Experimental tests are under preparation. Realistic simulations have been carried out with the advanced in-house simulation program CSIM using input data for all components of the prototype. CSIM is a steady state circuit simulator (primarily) for trans-critical CO 2 cycles, which uses well calibrated models for all components. A state of the art inverter driven R 410 A split unit has been tested experimentally as a baseline unit. Obtained results have been compared to simulation results for the CO 2 prototype. Results indicate that the prototype CO 2 unit will perform almost equal as the R 410 A baseline unit in AC mode at 27. 8 °C and 35 °C ambient temperature. In heat pump mode, the prototype CO 2 unit is predicted to perform around 30 to 40 % better at – 5 °C and 5 °C ambient temperature. ...|$|R

50|$|In the {{high-temperature}} power stage, expanding {{high pressure}} hydrogen from the <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> converts the heat energy into electrical energy via the MEA. As the high-temperature, high pressure hydrogen is forced through the PEM it is ionized, producing protons and electrons. The protons {{pass through the}} membrane while the electrodes expel the electrons through a load. After passing through the PEM, the protons recombine with the electrons to produce low pressure hydrogen gas that flows out to the <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> From {{the perspective of the}} high-temperature stage, the load consists of the external load on the engine and the low-temperature <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> In the <b>compression</b> <b>stage,</b> electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen. As the hydrogen travels between the stages, it passes through a heat exchanger that increases efficiency by helping to keep the high-temperature stage hot and the low-temperature stage cool.|$|R
