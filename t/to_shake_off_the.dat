25|$|Zarbienus; early mid-1st century BC: A king of Corduene {{who made}} overtures to Appius Claudius when {{the latter was}} staying at Antiocheia, wishing <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> yoke of Tigranes. He was betrayed and was assassinated {{with his wife and}} {{children}} before the Romans entered Armenia. When Lucullus arrived he celebrated his funeral rites with great pomp, setting fire to the funeral pile with his own hand, and had a sumptuous monument erected to him.|$|E
25|$|With Thomas Bromley, the Solicitor General from 1569, Gerard had {{to settle}} many {{problems}} of jurisdiction. One {{of the most important}} concerned an attempt in 1576 by Worcester and Worcestershire <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> authority of the Council of Wales and the Marches - a bid which Gerard and Bromley turned down. Gerard must have been disappointed that it was Bromley, about a decade younger than himself, who was appointed Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1579, although he was rewarded with a knighthood in that year.|$|E
25|$|The Mali Empire {{has enjoyed}} {{virtually}} no military reverses {{in its first}} century of existence and had grown at a terrific rate in both size and wealth by the time Ibn Battuta arrived there. However this wealth and power {{may have been the}} reason behind more aggressive attacks by its neighbors as well as the complacency of some of the mansas in dealing with them. Subject peoples on the fringes of the empire slowly began <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> yoke of Mandinka hegemony. This happened slowly at first, but after 1450 the empire would begin to crumble very rapidly.|$|E
6000|$|Deronda had a {{strongly}} resistant feeling: he was inclined <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> hastily <b>the</b> touch on his arm; {{but he managed}} to slip it away and said coldly, [...] "I am an Englishman." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was the exalted tone {{in which}} he spoke this last {{sentence}} that broke up the conversation between Butler and Jeanie, and brought them both [...] "ben the house," [...] to use {{the language of the}} country. Here they found the poor old man half frantic between grief and zealous ire against Saddletree's proposed measures, his cheek inflamed, his hand clenched, and his voice raised, while the tear in his eye, and the occasional quiver of his accents, showed that his utmost efforts were inadequate <b>to</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> consciousness of his misery. Butler, apprehensive of the consequences of his agitation to an aged and feeble frame, ventured to utter to him a recommendation to patience.|$|R
60|$|Being decidedly nettled herself, {{and longing}} <b>to</b> see him <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> apathy that so altered him, Amy {{sharpened}} both tongue and pencil, and began.|$|R
25|$|My beloved children, I do {{not know}} what you await <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E
25|$|Wells contemplates {{the ideas}} of nature and nurture and {{questions}} humanity in books such as The Island of Doctor Moreau. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a dystopian novel, When the Sleeper Wakes (1899, rewritten as The Sleeper Awakes, 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have {{become more and more}} separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers. The Island of Doctor Moreau is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Blyth's present {{depression}} of spirits {{was not entirely}} attributable to a certain ominous reluctance to leave home, {{which he had been}} vainly trying <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> since <b>the</b> morning. He had a secret reason for his uneasiness which happened to be intimately connected with the model, whose Herculean chest and arms he was now busily engaged in drawing.|$|R
60|$|Dawney {{threw up}} {{his head as if}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> this impeachment; <b>the</b> curve of his chin thus {{displayed}} was imposing in its fulness; altogether he was imposing, having an air of capability.|$|R
60|$|The next day, Mrs. Dormay and Ciceley {{returned}} to Rockley, whose tenant had fortunately left {{a few weeks}} before. Charlie and Harry both went over with them, and stayed {{for three or four}} days, and they were glad to see that Mrs. Dormay seemed <b>to</b> be <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> weight of her trouble, and was looking more like her old self.|$|R
25|$|Male M. drewseni only spend 4.8 days in {{the nest}} after they emerge and {{spend the rest of}} their lives outside of the nest. Once they leave the nest, males tend to {{circulate}} where specific females are because of feeding and foraging opportunities. On their circuits, males seek out nectar from flowers and also seek out mates. Observations have shown that if a male sees a female nearby, he will alter his flight path and pounce on the female to attempt copulation. In most cases, the female is able <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> male and fly away. If two males come in contact with the same female, they will usually attack each other and the male that first found the female will try to bite the second male.|$|E
25|$|Tirumala was {{succeeded by}} his son Muttu Veerapa, whose first act was <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hated Sultan yoke. He tried to induce the Nayak of Tanjore to join the enterprise. However, alarmed at the power {{aspirations}} of his neighbour, the Tanjore ruler disclaimed all connection with his neighbour's aspirations and made an attempt to conciliate with the Sultans. The Sultan invaders moved against Trichinopoly and Madurai, spreading havoc, while Muttu Alakadri remained inactive behind {{the walls of the}} fort. Fortunately for him, the enemy soon had to retire, for their devastations produced a local famine and pestilence from which they themselves suffered terribly. They made a half-hearted attempt on Trichinopoly and then permitted themselves to be bought off for a very moderate sum. Muttu Alakadri did not long survive their departure, but gave himself over to debauchery with an abandon which soon brought him to a dishonoured grave.|$|E
25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed to work {{so he had to}} come in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. But most {{importantly}} for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke was pouring from the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a suspected engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over the radio to try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> challenge of Barrichello in second.|$|E
5000|$|Rogers visits François Clemmons's music class. In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, Lady Elaine is {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> living like <b>the</b> Pauls and Paulines of Planet Purple. She even refuses {{to talk to}} X.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{woman to}} be feared," [...] thought Metem <b>to</b> himself as, <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> priestesses, he passed her upon {{his way up the}} long chamber. Presently he had reached the end of it, and was saluting the {{presence}} of the Baaltis by kneeling and touching the carpet with his brow.|$|R
50|$|At the War Department, {{officials}} tell Ruth that Joe {{has been}} unwittingly {{drawn into a}} spy operation. She radios the aircraft, now far <b>off</b> course over <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean, convincing Joe to turn Ace in. Reacting angrily, he tries <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> Ace <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wing, but is restrained by the others. When Ace returns, a struggle over the controls leads to a burst of steam spraying over Ace's face, blinding him and the aircraft being forced to ditch in the ocean.|$|R
25|$|With no {{constitutional}} amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India {{and also the}} day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then had been trying <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; Long live the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay {{beneath the surface of}} the people of the state.|$|E
25|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.|$|E
500|$|Once in Quor'toth, Connor briefly {{falls back}} into more {{aggressive}} behavior {{before he is}} able <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> negative influences of the dimension. His fake magical memories of the childhood Wolfram & Hart created for him have faded since magic {{was taken from the}} world, but he has made enough real memories of a happy life to not fall back into his unstable behavior. Dog-like demons of Quor'toth came to fear and respect [...] "The Destroyer" [...] and overheard Holtz telling Connor about love. Generations of these demons expressed love and compassion in Connor's name and were slaughtered for it. Connor, Angel, Faith and Willow are able to rescue the last few of these demons while fighting off the Old One that rules Quor'toth and Willow sends the dog-demons to a peaceful dimension.|$|E
50|$|The Bulleteers {{take aim}} {{now at the}} city's {{treasury}} building, but Superman steps {{in front of them}} and knocks <b>the</b> rocket-car <b>off</b> course. As they struggle to regain control, he leaps in the air and grabs its front trying again to force it off-course, but the Bulleteers, through wild maneuvering, manage <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> car <b>to</b> the ground below. Superman lunges to keep them from the treasury, only to arrive too late. Piles of rubble from the explosion bury him.|$|R
50|$|The Volsci {{joined the}} Latins {{in their final}} bid <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> Roman dominion, <b>the</b> Latin War, 340 - 338, but Rome was once again victorious and the Volscian cities were {{incorporated}} into the Roman Republic {{with varying degrees of}} political rights. Roman reversals in the Samnite Wars caused some unrest among the Volsci but had no lasting impact.|$|R
5000|$|In the morning, Diane and the shotgun-toting Lep {{face off}} in a final {{confrontation}} in an open field where she attempts to hotwire and escape in Harry's car (with Harry's dead body in the front seat) as Lep tries to shoot her with the shotgun. When Lep runs out of ammunition, he climbs {{on top of the}} moving car to stop Diane attempting to drive away. The confrontation ends when Diane manages <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> Lep <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hood, and then runs him over, killing him.|$|R
500|$|Olajuwon {{established}} himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark Dream Shake. Executed with uncanny speed and power, they are still regarded as the pinnacle of [...] "big man" [...] footwork. Shaquille O'Neal stated: [...] "Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves – that gives him 20 moves." [...] Olajuwon himself traced the {{move back to the}} soccer-playing days of his youth. [...] "The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot." [...] The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky-hook.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} other professors disliked the name and {{organisational}} structure of the university, and wanted it <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> association with [...] "technology" [...] and become a [...] "real university". While Baxter did not side with them, contending that the university's association with the government provided funding and facilities, most {{of what he did}} moved in that direction. He hired full-time staff, and broadened the scope of the subjects taught and the research carried out. A Department of Food Technology was the first, and for many years the only, one of its kind in Australia. He replaced the diploma-level with a new bachelor of science in chemical engineering degree, offering conversion courses to allow students to upgrade their diplomas to degrees. The first chemical engineering students had enrolled in [...] 1949, and nine graduated with the bachelor of science degree in 1952. The School of Chemical Engineering became the first school to relocate to the new campus in Kensington in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Dupotet {{attempted}} {{to throw off}} Amethysts pursuit during the night by turning westwards once more, but Seymour anticipated this manoeuvre and turned his ship westwards as well, discovering Niémen {{only a few miles}} ahead at 21:40. Rapidly gaining on the French ship, Seymour began firing his bow-chasers, small guns situated in the bows of the frigate, in an attempt to damage her rigging so that he could bring his broadsides to bear. Dupotet responded with his stern-chasers, but by 01:00 on 6 April it was clear that Amethyst was going to catch the French frigate. The pursuit had been exhausting: since first sighting the British ships, Niémen had travelled over [...] and was just [...] from the Spanish coast when she was caught. At 01:15, Amethyst opened fire, Niémen immediately responding and turning to the northeast in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> British ship. Seymour followed his opponent and at 01:45 was again close enough to engage, the frigates firing upon one another from close range for over an hour.|$|E

U-99 and U-47 then attacked Elmbank with gunfire, {{but she did not}} sink until morning, at which point U-99 left the scene to return to Lorient.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 January 2014, with a {{very early}} Vasilis Torosidis goal, Roma labored to a 1-0 victory over Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia <b>to</b> help <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> 3-0 league loss against Juventus last weekend. It was indubitably {{important}} for Roma to get over their first defeat of the season as quickly as possible, and to that end, Rudi Garcia sent out a side that {{was a mixture of}} first team players, fringe players, and youngsters.On 17 March 2014, Torosidis scored as Roma beat Udinese Calcio to maintain their grip on second place from Juventus in Serie A and restored the two-goal margin before Dusan Basta of Udinese ensured a nervous final 10 minutes for Roma.|$|R
500|$|By {{the time}} Heseltine began {{composing}} seriously, around 1915–16, {{he had started}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming influence of Delius. He had discovered English folk-song in 1913, his Oxford year, and had begun to study Elizabethan and Jacobean music. In 1916 he came {{under the spell of}} van Dieren, whose influence soon exceeded that of Delius and led to a significant development in compositional technique, first evident in the Saudades song cycle of 1916–17. Gray writes that from Van Dieren, Heseltine [...] "learned to purify and organise his harmonic texture ... and the thick, muddy chords which characterised the early songs gave place to clear and vigorous part-writing". [...] "In 1917–18 Heseltine's passion for Celtic culture, stimulated by his stay in Ireland, brought a new element to his music, and in 1921 he discovered Bartók. A late passion was the music of John Dowland, the Elizabethan lutenist, one of whose dances he arranged for brass band. These constituent parts contributed to the individual style of [...] Heseltine's music. Gray summarised this style thus; ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next time}} Robert was heard of, was in humble guise, with staff and wallet, when he {{received}} {{the blessing of the}} Pope at Rome; but afterward, when he entered Constantinople, he appeared in all his wonted magnificence.

50|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, the University of Leuven was until its closure a great centre of Jansenism in Europe, with professors such as Cornelius Jansen, Petrus Stockmans, Johannes van Neercassel, Josse Le Plat and {{especially}} Zeger Bernhard van Espen and his famous disciple Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim under <b>the</b> pseudonym Febronius. <b>To</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> this reputation, <b>the</b> faculty of theology thrice declared its adherence to the papal condemnation of Jansenist beliefs in the papal bull Unigenitus (1713).|$|R
