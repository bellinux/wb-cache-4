5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific <b>times</b> <b>after</b> the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E

Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At <b>times</b> <b>after</b> the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
5|$|By December 2009 {{mephedrone}} {{was available}} {{on at least}} 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 {{there were at least}} 78 online shops, half of which sold amounts of less than 200grams and half that also sold bulk quantities. The price per gram varied from £9.50 to £14. Between July 2009 and February 2010, UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Services (NPIS) entry on mephedrone 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries; the requests increased month on month over this period. In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 <b>times.</b> <b>After</b> mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{continued}} efforts of U.S. Chess Federation officials, a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands, {{in which it was}} accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32. FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm their participation in the match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion. In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several <b>times</b> <b>after</b> 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three <b>times</b> <b>after</b> his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Fellow linebacker Ken Brown {{was named}} a first-team All-Big East selection, {{signifying}} his status {{as one of the}} best players at his position in the conference. He finished the season with 93 tackles, including six for loss and two sacks, enough for No. 3 on the team in tackles. Despite that success, Brown suffered a pulled hamstring before Virginia Tech's final regular-season game and his presence in the Gator Bowl was doubtful. Virginia Tech sophomore defensive end Cornell Brown was named the best defensive college player in the state of Virginia by the Roanoke <b>Times</b> <b>after</b> earning 20 tackles for loss, including 11 sacks, and 35 quarterback hurries during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Laguna del Maule is a {{volcanic}} {{field in the}} Andes mountain range of Chile, close to, and partly overlapping, the Chile-Argentina frontier. The bulk of the volcanic field is in the Talca province of Chile's Maule Region. It is {{a segment of the}} Southern Volcanic Zone, part of the Andean Volcanic Belt. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during postglacial <b>times,</b> <b>after</b> glaciers had retreated from the area. This activity has generated cones, lava domes, lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del Maule lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the Maule river. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the last glaciation; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball at its 40-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Cardinals were unable to gain more than four yards on three plays and were forced into their first punt of the game. Throughout much of {{the second quarter}}, both teams traded punts as each went three and out on several occasions. By the quarter's halfway point, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice in the period. Louisville punted the ball three <b>times</b> <b>after</b> kicking no punts {{at all in the}} first quarter.|$|E
