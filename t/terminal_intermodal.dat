5000|$|The Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District is a {{mass transit}} {{system that is}} part of the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area in which {{property}} taxes are levied to support a local transit system operating buses and the Illinois <b>Terminal</b> <b>intermodal</b> facility in downtown Champaign. Known locally as [...] "MTD," [...] the term also applies to the Board of Trustees or to the administration and operations supported both by these taxes as well as other revenues, such as bus fares. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which lies within the District, all 42,883 students pay a $59 transportation fee every semester in 2014-2015 in exchange for unlimited use of the bus services. The District currently levies about 28 cents of property taxes per $100 of assessed valuation. The seven members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Champaign County Board. Although Willard Airport lies outside the boundaries of the district, MTD offers District residents bus service to and from the airport on routes funded by the University. Buses are produced by the Canadian company New Flyer, Eldorado, and Gillig. MTD introduced hybrid buses to its fleet in Fall 2009, while sprinter vans are produced by Mercedes-Benz.|$|E
40|$|Positioning of {{intermodal}} terminals is of key importance {{since it}} affects the very investment into the terminal, ecological, physical issues {{and the costs of}} the operation of individual terminals. Detailed analysis has to be performed by decision-making regarding the siting of intermodal terminals. The work analyzes the relevant criteria necessary for the siting of intermodal terminals. The problem of the proposed research is the structure of intermodal systems in the Republic of Croatia with the case study of inland waterways. The research and the study of the characteristics of intermodal terminals network on inland waterways should result in a concept of system reorganization, i. e. terminal planning methodology. By analysing relevant indicators according to the existing facts, and by using scientific methods and methodologies, the relevant criteria necessary to define the position and categories of intermodal terminals on inland waterways in the Republic of Croatia have been defined and evaluated on the examples of Sisak, Osijek, Vukovar and Slavonski Brod.

40|$|In {{the time}} when the World can {{experience}} volatility of international trade due to World economic crisis, concentration of the shipping industry and liberalisation of transport markets, port competition is becoming fiercer over the time. In such an environment, freight forwarders’ role {{is becoming more and more}} important, representing a valuable link in the whole supply chain. This research attempts to analyse and benchmark port services based on the factors and criteria most important to freight forwarders’ port choice, the operational efficiency and performance benchmarking of container ports and terminals, situated in the area of the United Kingdom and Balkan Peninsula. It does so by applying different techniques, starting from questionnaire survey among freight forwarders in these regions in order to determine the most important port choice factors, followed by analytical benchmarking technique such as DEA to analyse impact of operating factors on port efficiency and concluded with productivity analysis to measure terminal productivity changes during, before and after the World economic crisis. The study found that region where freight forwarders are acting has impact on their port choice. Geographical location seems to be the most important factor while choosing a port, followed by <b>terminal</b> <b>intermodal</b> connection efficiency and reliability, frequency of ship calling, inland delivery cost, port accessibility, flexibility to answer freight forwarders demands and port working hours. Benchmarking analysis showed that most of the terminals from the sample are inefficient, where mainly larger terminals based in the UK depicted higher efficiency scores above 80 %. Study found terminal operational efficiency is positively related to both seaside and landside terminal connectivity and port customer service. Productivity analysis showed high volatility in productivity change during the World economic crisis, with overall productivity loss, suggesting that terminals were mainly focused on terminal expansion rather than rationalisation of input use.

40|$|O sistema de transportes representa parte considerável dos custos do setor logístico como um todo. Para tanto, a intermodalidade surge como alternativa de redução de custos e, consequentemente, aumento da competitividade do agronegócio nacional. Sendo assim, o <b>terminal</b> <b>intermodal</b> é elo essencial para que ocorra o transbordo do grão de um modal para outro. Todavia, ganha relevância averiguar o desempenho operacional dos terminais intermodais da cadeia logística de grãos nacional com o intuito de identificar falhas e possíveis melhorias no sistema. Dessa maneira, os objetivos foram alcançados por meio de estudo multicaso, qualiquantitativo, nos terminais que aceitaram {{responder}} o questionário semi-estruturado. A mensuração da eficiência operacional dos terminais foi feita por meio do modelo BCC orientado ao produto da técnica não paramétrica Análise Envoltória de Dados com a utilização de três insumos e um único produto. Foram encontrados cinco tipos de terminais intermodais na cadeia logística de grãos nacional e os resultados indicam baixa eficiência operacional, sendo possível aumentar, em média, 54, 1 % a produtividade do setor, sem que se faça qualquer tipo de investimentos na estrutura física e humana dos terminais. Cabe ressaltar que o trabalho limitou-se à mensuração da eficiência operacional, não levando em consideração aspectos financeiros. Todavia, os resultados dessa pesquisa inovadora, quanto ao seu escopo, podem servir de apoio à decisão para os gestores terminais, assim como para o Governo, na proposição de políticas públicas. The {{transport system}} represents a considerable {{part of the}} logistics sector costs. This way, the intermodality is an alternative to reduce costs and increase the competitiveness of the Brazilian agribusiness. Intermodal terminal is the essential link between two or more means of transport. Therefore, {{it becomes relevant to}} investigate the intermodal terminals operational performance of the national supply chain of grains and try to identify shortcomings and possible improvements in its system. The goals of this work were achieved by a multicase study, qualitative and quantitative, with those terminals that accepted to answer the semi-structured questionnaire. The operational efficiency measurement was made by the model BCC, product-oriented using the non-parametric technique Data Envelopment Analysis with three inputs and one single product. Five types of intermodal terminals were found in the national grain supply. The results indicate low operational efficiency, allowing an increase of 54. 1 %, an average, the productivity of the sector, without making any physical and human structure investments. This study was limited only to measure the operational efficiency, and non financial aspects were considered. Therefore, the results of innovative research, as to its scope, can be used as decision support by the terminals' managers, as well as the Brazilian Government, helping to propose public policies...|$|E
