50|$|The {{history of}} this site for {{industrial}} use probably {{began in the early}} 19th century, when Joseph Gillette operated a series of industries on the river, including two sawmills, a gristmill, carding mill, and <b>turning</b> <b>shop.</b> The gristmill was acquired by his children in 1840, but did not thrive as grain milling operations became increasingly larger and regional, and was shut down by 1880. The technology that survives in the building appears to date to about 1870; the building's construction date is unknown, but is consistent mid-19th century construction methods.|$|E

50|$|The present {{village of}} Whitingham was {{established}} in 1822, when a mineral spring with supposed healing properties {{was found in the}} area. Sadawga Brook, which feeds the Deerfield River via Harriman Reservoir, drops substantially after leaving Sadawga Lake, and provided a source of water power for industries. By 1840 the village included a gristmill, sawmill, and wood <b>turning</b> <b>shop,</b> along with a small cluster of homes. This economic growth led to the village's increasing importance, resulting in the movement of the town's civic center there from a nearby hill in the 1860s. The village began to decline economically {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century, and the sites of some of its mills were flooded by the construction of Harriman Dam in 1924, while others succumbed to fire.|$|E
50|$|Items made on {{the lathe}} include tool handles, candlesticks, egg cups, knobs, lamps, rolling pins, {{cylindrical}} boxes, Christmas ornaments, bodkins, knitting needles, needle cases, thimbles, pens, chessmen, spinning tops; legs, spindles and pegs for furniture; balusters and newel posts for architecture; baseball bats, hollow forms such as urns or sculptures; bowls, platters, and chair seats. Industrial production has replaced many of these products from the traditional <b>turning</b> <b>shop.</b> However, the wood lathe is still used for decentralized production of limited or custom turnings. A skilled turner can produce {{a wide variety of}} objects with five or six simple tools. The tools can be reshaped easily for the task at hand. In many parts of the world, the lathe has been a portable tool that goes to the source of the wood, or adapts to temporary workspaces. 21st-century turners restore furniture, continue folk-art traditions, produce custom architectural work, and create fine craft for galleries. Woodturning appeals to people who like to work with their hands, find pleasure in problem-solving, or enjoy the tactile and visual qualities of wood.|$|E
50|$|Monmouth was {{considered}} one of the best agricultural towns in the state, producing hay, apples and potatoes, in addition to beef cattle and dairy products. It also had excellent sites for watermills. By 1859, when the population was 1,925, it had two factories for making boot-webbing and binding, a shovel and hoe factory, a tannery, a machine shops, some mechanic <b>shops,</b> some wood <b>turning</b> <b>shops,</b> a sleigh and carriage factory, some boot and shoe shops, a carpet factory, and a sash, blind and door factory. In 1849, the Androscoggin & Kennebec Railroad (later part of the Maine Central Railroad) opened to the town.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, woodturners in England worked in <b>Turning</b> <b>Shops,</b> usually within the master-apprentice system. In Germany and Russia, {{woodturning}} was concentrated in villages {{which had a}} specialty, such as turning toys. Bow lathes and pole lathes continued in use for decentralized, one-man production of architectural elements and bowls {{in many parts of}} the world. In the US, woodturning was part of the curriculum of industrial arts taught in public schools—often a prerequisite for classes in building furniture. The 'problems' from textbooks included both tool management skills, and assignments to turn objects such as gavels, darning eggs, boxes, trays, candlesticks, lamps, and legs for furniture.|$|R
