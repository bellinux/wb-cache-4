5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} anything he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, {{that it is the}} wrong thing <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to philosophy, Boyle devoted {{much time to}} theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial polemics. At the Restoration of the king in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.|$|E
500|$|After going undefeated {{and winning}} the Big Ten championship, Michigan was invited to Pasadena to face the USC Trojans in the 1948 Rose Bowl—the Wolverines' first bowl game since 1901. Just before Christmas, the team boarded a train in Ann Abor for a three-day trip across the country. With little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train, Alvin Wistert {{recalled}} that Dworsky entertained the team with music. [...] "Dan Dworsky was a piano player.

At the time, Camp said: [...] "Big, strong and fast, he combined all the defensive and offensive qualities of the best line men with the speed, sure tackling and intuition as to what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instant that are winning qualities of the defensive back. [...] In addition, his passing was excellent, as he had plenty of speed for his kicker, steadiness for his quarter, and ability to pass in directions other than in a straight line which made him especially valuable in certain formation plays".|$|E

500|$|Stannard {{stayed behind}} after the {{showcase}} {{to talk to}} the group. He then reported to his songwriter partner, Matt Rowe, that he had found [...] "the pop group of their dreams." [...] Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London, in January 1995. Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: [...] "I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really." [...] The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record. In her autobiography, Brown recalls that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate [...] "the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first attempt}} at a Goosebumps film was in 1998, which Tim Burton was going to produce. Chris Meledandri, the {{president}} of Fox Family Films, said: [...] "I think you'll see us tackling a scale of story that would be prohibitive <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small screen". However, the film did not materialize since they {{could not find a}} script they liked or determine which book or monster to adapt. Ten years later, Columbia Pictures acquired rights to create a Goosebumps film, with Neal H. Moritz and Deborah Forte, the latter of whom developed the TV series, producing the film. Duo Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were hired as screenwriters and wrote the original script for the film. They felt that the individual books in the series were too short to adapt into a film, so they chose instead to do a fake biographical film in which R. L. Stine writes a book and all the monsters within it become real.|$|E

500|$|Mary {{was convicted}} on 25 October {{and sentenced to}} death with only one commissioner, Lord Zouche, expressing any form of dissent. Despite this, Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution, {{even in the face of}} {{pressure}} from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence. She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent, and was fearful of the consequences, especially if, in retaliation, Mary's son James formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England. Elizabeth asked Paulet, Mary's final custodian, if he would contrive a clandestine way to [...] "shorten the life" [...] of Mary, which he refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that he would not make [...] "a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot on my poor posterity". On 1 February 1587, Elizabeth signed the death warrant, and entrusted it to William Davison, a privy councillor. On the 3rd, ten members of the Privy Council of England, having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge, decided to carry out the sentence at once.|$|E
500|$|In 1970 he {{travelled}} to Fiji to arbitrate in {{a dispute}} between some Fijian sugar-cane growers and the Australian owners of the refining mills, which he was permitted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition {{he did not take}} a fee. Denning refused to have any contact with the government as a way to emphasise his neutrality in the situation. The agreements between growers and millers had been based on a contract written in 1961 due to end in March 1970. The growers did not understand the price formula used and were convinced that they were getting a bad deal; in response to their demand for better terms the mill-owners threatened to leave Fiji. Despite criticism from both sides {{at the beginning of the}} arbitration process Denning came up with a solution which appeased both sides, creating a new formula for working out prices and requiring that the mill owners have an accountant inspect their accounts and report back to the growers. Denning's decision impressed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who invited him to report on the banana growing industry in Jamaica in the vacation of 1971. His foreign travels to lecture on English law led to him being described as the [...] "Ambassador-at-Large for the common law".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} {{was published in the}} The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Tom Taylor, the owner of a pretty rustic cottage, where he lives all alone, believes himself to be a woman hater, and reproaches his friend John Sparks, when the latter tries to ornament the cottage with posters of women. Taylor's property is valuable, and {{at the opening of the}} play a financier purchases it at a satisfactory figure. To close the deal, Taylor is obliged to go to the financier's hotel, and there he attracts the attention of four pretty young girl guests. One of them, Lou Bennett (played by Violet Heming), asks John to introduce Tom. This John declines <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that Tom is a woman hater. Lou bets the other girls that she can make Tom fall in love with her and propose to her within a week. They take the bet, not knowing Tom's name or where he lives. They follow his horse, borrowing a buggy built for two, that is waiting outside the hotel. Lou meets Tom, and wins her bet - he falls in love with her. But, incidentally, the girl loses her own heart. Tom finds that he has been tricked, and is preparing to go away forever, when Lou arrives, speaks with him, and all ends nicely." ...|$|E

500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I {{try not to think about}} things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he would like to try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E

Naomi was quick to note the varying 'nuances of feeling', and said [...] "My daughter, shall I not seek out for thee a rest?" [...] The expression [...] "rest", or [...] "resting-place", though in itself of generic import, was, when used in such circumstances as environed Ruth, quite specific in application, and would be at once understood. It was a [...] "home" [...] to which Naomi pointed, a home for her daughter's heart. In such a home, if warm and pure, there would be repose for the affections.|$|E

2500|$|LucasArts and BioWare {{settled on}} {{developing}} Knights of the Old Republic for the PC and Xbox.

Other factors included the console's recent success and the opportunity to release one of the Xbox's first RPGs. BioWare had previously developed MDK2 for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. Hudson said that [...] "Having experience in developing for other consoles gave us the proper mindset for implementing this game on the Xbox, and, by comparison, the Xbox was relatively easy to develop for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Garrett {{was performing}} her one-woman show Betty Garrett and Other Songs in Westwood {{when she was}} offered the role of landlady Edna Babish in Laverne & Shirley. The character was a five-time divorcée who eventually married Laverne's father Frank. Although Garrett reportedly felt she was never given enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show, she appreciated {{the fact that her}} musical talents occasionally were incorporated into the plot. [...] In 1981, when the series was extended beyond what had been intended to be its final season, Garrett was forced to drop out because she already had committed to performing with Sandy Dennis, Jack Gilford, Hope Lange, and Joyce Van Patten in The Supporting Cast on Broadway. The play closed after only eight performances, but returning to Laverne & Shirley was not an option, as the writers had explained Edna's disappearance by having her divorce Frank, although this was not directly addressed until the series' final season.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town.

When we came <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Town, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E
