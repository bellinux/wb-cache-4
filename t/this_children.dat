25|$|There {{are some}} local Christmas traditions; {{one of them}} is the popular figure of the Tió de Nadal, {{consisting}} in a hollow log which after few days taking care of it, during Christmas Day or on Christmas Eve one orders it to defecate presents and, in order to make <b>this,</b> <b>children</b> beats the tió with sticks, while they singing various traditional songs.

25|$|Most recent is a {{study done}} by Larsen, Pulkkinen, and Adams (2002) in which they looked at many {{different}} levels of childhood behavior and emotion and the correlation into adulthood agreeableness. In their first analyses, structure coefficients showed that childhood compliance, aggression, and self-control discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did activity versus passivity, constructiveness, and anxiety. In their second analyses, structure coefficients indicated that adulthood socialization and impulsivity discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did inhibition of aggression and anxiety. In linking childhood behavioral profiles to adulthood personality profiles, high-compliant, high-self-control, and low-aggressive children {{were most likely to}} become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. These children were more unlikely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults. Further, low-compliant, low-self-control, and high-aggressive children were likely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults and these children were unlikely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. In addition to <b>this,</b> <b>children</b> classified as low-compliance, low-self-control, low-aggression types and children classified as high-compliance, high-self-control, low-aggression types had a greater probability of becoming adults with high-agreeableness, high-socialization, high-impulsivity profiles. Looking at stability of agreeableness they found results that indicated that stable low agreeable individuals reported less career stability and more depression when compared with stable high agreeable individuals and low to high agreeable individuals. Further, stable high agreeable individuals reported lower levels of alcoholism than did the other groups and fewer arrests than did stable low agreeable individuals.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, the now {{superseded}} National Cycle Proficiency {{scheme was}} focused on primary schoolchildren aged 8 and above. In <b>this,</b> <b>children</b> would start by gaining an off-road certificate working up to their on-road certificate {{by the age of}} ten. Initial training and examination took place on simulated road layouts within school playgrounds. This approach has now been supplemented by the new National Standard for cycle training which is more focussed on practical on-road training.

2500|$|Tensions between first generation, , {{and second}} generation, , Japanese-Canadians were {{exacerbated}} during internment. The language gap that many [...] dealt with was intensified {{when they were}} given instructions within the camp. This often left children, whose English was generally better, to translate for their mothers {{and give them the}} commands. This led to an imbalance in power between mothers and their children. Due to their ability to understand English better than their mothers, children often found themselves in a position of power over their mothers. Mothers were no longer the guardians and could not shield their children from adult responsibilities. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>children</b> were forced to grow up and accept these positions of power before they were of an appropriate age.|$|E

60|$|Many of my readers, and {{especially}} those who are old and wise,--if I chance to have any such,--will be inclined {{to think that the}} judge behaved foolishly in thus cross-questioning his daughter on a matter, which, if it were expedient that it should die away, would die away the more easily the less it were talked about. But the judge was an odd man in many of the theories of his life. One of them, with reference to his children, was very odd, and altogether opposed to the usual practice of the world. It was this,--that they should be allowed, as far as was practicable, to do what they liked. Now the general opinion of the world is certainly quite the reverse--namely this, that children, {{as long as they are}} under the control of their parents, should be hindered and prevented in those things to which they are most inclined. Of course the world in general, in carrying out this practice, excuses it by an assertion,--made to themselves or others,--that children customarily like those things which they ought not to like. But the judge had an idea quite opposed to <b>this.</b> <b>Children,</b> he said, if properly trained would like those things which were good for them. Now it may be that he thought his daughter had been properly trained.|$|E

6000|$|... 1. Israel is to {{be taken}} for those that are such after the flesh; that is, for those that sprang from the loins of Jacob, and are called, 'Israel after the flesh, the {{children}} of the flesh.' Now these, as such, are not the persons interested in this exhortation, for by the flesh comes no true spiritual and eternal grace (Rom 9:6-8; 2 Cor 1:10-18). Men are not within the bounds of the promise of eternal life, as they are {{the children of the}} flesh, either in the more gross or more refined sense (Phil 3:4-6). Jacob was as spiritual a father as any HE, I suppose that now professeth the gospel; but his spiritualness could not convey down to <b>this</b> <b>children,</b> that were such only after the flesh, that spirit and grace that causeth sound conversion, and salvation by Jesus Christ. Hence Paul counts it a carnal thing to glory in this; and tells us plainly, If he had heretofore known Christ thus, that is, to have been his brother or kinsman, according to the flesh, or after that, he would henceforth know him, that is, so, 'no more' (2 Cor 5:16-18). For though the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet not that multitude, but the remnant that the Lord hath chosen and shall call, shall be saved (Rom 9:27; Joel 2:32). This, therefore, is as an arrow against the face of that false doctrine that the Jews leaned upon, to wit, that they were in the state of grace, and everlasting favour of God, because the children and offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

60|$|The art {{systems of}} the past have been devised by {{philosophers}} who looked upon human beings as obstructions. They have tried to educate boys' minds before they had any. How much better {{it would be in}} these early years to teach children to use their hands in the rational service of mankind. I would have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts. It would be a golden hour to the children. And you would soon raise up a race of handicraftsmen who would transform the face of your country. I have seen only one such school in the United States, and this was in Philadelphia and was founded by my friend Mr. Leyland. I stopped there yesterday and have brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you. Here are two discs of beaten brass: the designs on them are beautiful, the workmanship is simple, and the entire result is satisfactory. The work was done by a little boy twelve years old. This is a wooden bowl decorated by a little girl of thirteen. The design is lovely and the colouring delicate and pretty. Here you see a piece of beautiful wood carving accomplished by a little boy of nine. In such work as <b>this,</b> <b>children</b> learn sincerity in art. They learn to abhor the liar in art--the man who paints wood to look like iron, or iron to look like stone. It is a practical school of morals. No better way is there to learn to love Nature than to understand Art. It dignifies every flower of the field. And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary stone. What we want is something spiritual added to life. Nothing is so ignoble that Art cannot sanctify it.|$|E
