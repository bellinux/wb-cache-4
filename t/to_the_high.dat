5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 review, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> {{levels of}} {{mortality}} and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective {{pressure on the}} human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, {{and the absence of}} Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} typhoid fever in flooded areas. In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> costs of licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with {{the production of the}} film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E
