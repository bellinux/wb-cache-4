He admits that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> {{in the room and}} that he will help her. However, she has to go with him to a clinic that is in Brazil. On August 2, Ryan tells Greenlee that he wants her to go to Brazil. On August 4, it was revealed that Greenlee lied about her leg numbness.

This means that there are individuals who belong to the intersection ("collegium") of all decisive coalitions. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who has a veto, then he belongs to the collegium. If the rule is assumed to be neutral, then it does have someone who has a veto.|$|E
2500|$|Negative {{scores are}} common, and {{occasionally}} even the victor's score may be negative. Score totals are {{announced at the}} conclusion of the show. Fry has said, [...] "I think we all agree that nobody in this universe understands QI's scoring system."

2500|$|Brando {{was known}} for his tumultuous {{personal}} life and his large number of wives, girlfriends and children. He was the father to sixteen known children, three of whom were adopted. Some sources claim he fathered as many as 17 children or more. In 1976, he told a French journalist, [...] "Homosexuality is so much in fashion, it no longer makes news. Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences, and I am not ashamed. I have never paid much attention to what people think about me. But if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who is convinced that Jack Nicholson and I are lovers, may they continue to do so. I find it amusing." ...|$|E

Encouraged, he prepares to leave Elena's house (Duet: Cielo! in qual estasi! / [...] "Heavens, I feel myself transported in ecstasy"), and he and Elena expresses similar emotions. All leave as Elena goes inside.|$|E

In 2002, {{he told the}} New York Times that he woke up in a Phoenix hotel room with no memory of having driven from Los Angeles. [...] "It was two days before his 38th birthday. Still, he continued to spiral downward, at times sitting at home for hours without saying a word. He'd climb {{in his car and}} cruise aimlessly for days: once he went on a drive and didn't return for two months. [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> fighting within you, it makes your life unbearable," [...] he said. [...] "Anger has to be converted into something else or it destroys you." [...] He said that a major help in his recovery was his belief in God. He has criticised atheism, saying in 2011 that [...] "being an atheist must be like living in a closed cell with no windows". In an interview with Larry King in 2016, Hopkins described himself as an agnostic and said he believed in a [...] "superior consciousness in all of us". He gave up smoking using the Allen Carr method. In 2008, he embarked on a weight loss program, and by 2010, he had lost 80 pounds.|$|E

6000|$|We had not {{sat here}} many minutes, when Mrs. Markleham, who usually {{contrived}} {{to be in}} a fuss about something, came bustling in, with her newspaper in her hand, and said, out of breath, 'My goodness gracious, Annie, why didn't you tell me <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> in the Study!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Then in August 2010, Moroccan {{producer}} RedOne {{confirmed his}} involvement in the project during an interview with BBC Music, where he confirmed that the it was the third time that new material had been recorded for the album. When asked why he thought the album didn't previously come out RedOne said [...] "Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonald's, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent." [...] He confirmed that he had produced the majority of the new album. Scherzinger followed up his comments in an interview with X magazine in September 2010. She said [...] "It was actually my decision not to put Her Name Is Nicole out, not the label's". Scherzinger then said how much of an honor it was to work with RedOne. [...] "He's an unbelievable producer and musician. He had made some amazing songs with Lady Gaga. Now, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> with the 'x factor'. I can't touch GaGa or RedOne in that space, but I know that we've created something unique of our own." [...] RedOne revealed that Jimmy Iovine (chairman of Scherzinger's record label) personally called him to work on Scherzinger's album.|$|E

Gaskarth said it was [...] "actually something I can relate to, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> from my past I'm distanced with now and the only at I can revisit that time is in my dreams. It made for a cool song." [...] Gaskarth called [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] the [...] "kind of front porch, snare brushes and acoustic guitar slow jam I always wanted to write." [...] He added the lyrics were [...] "very personal" [...] and said it is a [...] "good song to put on when you miss somebody and just want to relax." [...] Gaskarth calld [...] "Heroes" [...] the [...] "no-so-find farewell closer" [...] that is also the [...] "most pop-punk song" [...] on the record, in tribute to their roots. He classed it as an ironic song since it mocks the concept of [...] "people idolising bands and all the drama that goes along with that when those bands try to evolve their sound as they grow up." [...] He said it was an [...] "important final song and point to make for this album specifically as we've really taken some risks and stretched ourselves." [...] The title of [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] comes from the film National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989).|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. No {{one who did}} {{not know}} of it would have a chance of finding it. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> there now; don't you see a light smoke rising behind the bush?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am thinking, friend, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> {{else she}} will want {{when she hears}} of this. How do you suppose that you will die to-morrow? Not so easily as you hope, perhaps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{good for}} me {{as far as it}} goes," [...] I replied. [...] "But I don't know why I should need special {{protection}} above others, unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who wants to harm me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Friction {{between the}} band and Thrill Jockey started to appear during the {{recording}} sessions, as Herring commented: [...] "We had some issues. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> from the label hanging around talking about deadlines.
