5|$|In Macbett, Eugène Ionesco's 1972 stage adaptation, Fleance is {{merged with}} the Malcolm character. Macol (Malcolm), who {{is thought to be}} King Duncan's son, is {{revealed}} to be Banco's (Banquo's). Duncan, wanting a male heir, adopted Macol. Macol fills the role of Malcolm in taking the kingdom from Macbett (Macbeth) at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), {{and while they}} are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus {{a symbol of the}} whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Air Force's offense began {{operations}} at its 24-yard line. Running back Anthony Butler broke free for an 18-yard gain {{on the third}} play of the drive, giving Air Force a first down. Two plays later, however, Harridge threw a pass that was intercepted by Tech linebacker Vegas Robinson. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> Air Force committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which allowed the Tech offense to take over at the Air Force 15-yard line. Tech needed just two plays to drive the 15 yards and earn a touchdown, its first of the game. With 2:26 remaining in the quarter, Air Force's lead had been cut to 10–7.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the game, Florida State was fully {{committed}} to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was forced to use two of its timeouts to stop the clock, but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt. The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being downed, pinning the Hokies deep in their territory. The first play of Tech's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick fumbled the ball while attempting to avoid a sack. Fortunately for the Hokies, the ball was leapt on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty. Due to the limited time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays, which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down. A 14-yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then completed a 19-yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick, which was tacked onto <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> After the penalty, Virginia Tech's offense was deep in Florida State territory, and two plays later, Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. Rather than attempt another two-point conversion, the Hokies kicked the extra point, and with 1:44 remaining, Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 2722.|$|E

5|$|The Bearcats' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, and the Hokies began the first drive of the third quarter. Evans rushed for four yards, but Oglesby lost four yards on a run during the next play. Facing third and ten, Taylor picked up the first down with an 11-yard run, but fumbled the ball at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> The loose ball was scooped up by Boone, who kept the Hokies' drive going at the Tech 30-yard line. After the fumble, Evans ran for seven yards and Taylor completed a 10-yard pass to Roberts for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Coale then rushed for seven yards on an end-around, and his run was followed by one by Boone, who ran for 16yards and a first down at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. Two more rushes by Roberts and Evans resulted in another first down, but once the Hokies passed the Cincinnati 20-yard line, the Bearcats' defense stiffened and denied the Hokies another first down. Facing fourth down, Tech again sent in Keys, who kicked a 35-yard field goal. The kick extended Tech's lead to 13–7 with 8:32 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to {{the new chairman of the}} Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, after a UCLA missed field goal, Earl McCullouch would run 52 yards on a flanker reverse; he fumbled near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> but USC recovered. He then caught another 13-yard pass. This set up O. J. Simpson for a weaving 12-yard {{touchdown}} run {{through most of}} the UCLA defensive unit in which he dragged two tacklers to the end zone. USC led at halftime 14-7.|$|E
25|$|According to Sophocles' play of The Trachiniae Iole's {{mother was}} Antiope and her {{siblings}} were Iphitus, Clytius, Toxeus, Deioneus, Molion, and Didaeon. In the play Iole {{is described as}} the daughter of King Eurytus, the royal princess of Oechalia. She is among the captive maidens of Oechalia when Heracles ransacks the city. She is to become the concubine of Heracles. Toward <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> Heracles asks his son Hyllus to marry her when he dies, so she will be well taken care of. Hyllus agrees to do this for his father.|$|E

When the memory of the death of her son is brought to the surface of her thoughts, she reminisces about how difficult a time that was for her, a time when she questioned everything, including her husband’s love and faithfulness to her.|$|E

25|$|Evolution has a {{different}} meaning {{in terms of the}} lizards. Leslie and Sarah are literally evolving. They were creatures that lived in the sea but apparently developed beyond their species. They were compelled to move to the land, though they do not really understand why. Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept the help that Nancy, enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Brook {{production}} seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, {{there has been a}} steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.|$|E
25|$|The play {{describes}} the Apshinken {{family and the}} pursuits in love of Owen and his butler, Robin. Owen pursues four women and Robin pursues only one. However, Robin is pursuing Sweetissa, whom Owen wishes to have for himself. To separate the two, Owen forges a letter which works until Robin's virtue proves his own devotion to Sweetissa. Although Robin lacks virtue in most regards, such as his stealing from his master, {{he is able to}} marry Sweetissa and, at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> Fielding breaks from his own tradition of comedic marriages by having Owen and Molly marry.|$|E
