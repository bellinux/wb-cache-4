500|$|The iPad 2 {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, praising its Apple A5 processor and 720p camera. Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that [...] "for {{those of you}} who haven't yet made the leap, feel free to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> dive in – the iPad 2 is {{as good as it gets}} right now.

"let's just <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{examine the}} rules that govern {{election}} spending in Britain and Canada (countries which, the last time I looked, were still counted among the world's leading democracies).

5000|$|<b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian band, Brighton Rock. The album was released in 1988. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is Brighton Rock's most commercially successful album, peaking at #22 on the Canadian album chart. The album was also certified Gold by the CRIA. [...] Gerry McGhee announced on April 30th, 2013 that <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> will be remastered by Warner Records.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well?" [...] she asked, with defiant inflection. [...] "What is to follow? Am I {{to govern}} {{my life to}} suit Westervelt or the street? I admire and respect Mr. Douglass very much. He {{has more than one}} side to him. I am sick of the slang of the Rialto and the greenroom. I'm tired of cheap witticisms and of gossip. With Mr. Douglass I can discuss calmly and rationally many {{questions}} which trouble me. He helps me. To talk with him enables me to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> try again. He enables me to forget the stage for a few hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{then asked}} 'Evans' {{if he could}} not lift the table for us, and he replied by tapping that he would try; and a few moments later the psychic, whose hands and feet began to pass through a period of tremor, warningly called out: 'Now please be very quiet, and don't break the circle.' I could hear him <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> a moment later the table rose and passed over Mrs. Towne's head so closely that she was obliged to lean to the right to avoid it, and we all heard it gently {{deposited}} not far from the psychic's right hand. While this was done, both Dr. Towne and Mrs. Towne affirmed that their fingers were locked with those of the psychic.|$|E

Once hostile, old ladies are [...] not won over. They don't care much for mind in the young.

6000|$|Lutyens {{felt the}} little chap <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and,</b> as it were, crouch under his rider. The ball was hopping towards the {{right-hand}} boundary, an Archangel riding {{for it with}} both spurs and a whip; but neither spur nor whip would make his pony stretch himself as he neared the crowd. The Maltese Cat glided under his very nose, picking up his hind legs sharp, for {{there was not a}} foot to spare between his quarters and the other pony's bit. It was as neat an exhibition as fancy figure-skating. Lutyens hit with all the strength he had left, but the stick slipped a little in his hand, and the ball flew off to the left instead of keeping close to the boundary. Who's Who was far across the ground, thinking hard as he galloped. He repeated stride for stride The Cat's manoeuvres with another Archangel pony, nipping the ball away from under his bridle, and clearing his opponent by half a fraction of an inch, for Who's Who was clumsy behind. Then he drove away towards the right as The Maltese Cat came up from the left; and Bamboo held a middle course exactly between them. The three were making a sort of Government-broad-arrow-shaped attack; and there was only the Archangels' back to guard the goal; but immediately behind them were three Archangels racing all they knew, and mixed up with them was Powell sending Shikast along on what he felt was their last hope. It takes a very good man {{to stand up to the}} rush of seven crazy ponies in the last quarters of a Cup game, when men are riding with their necks for sale, and the ponies are delirious. The Archangels' back missed his stroke and pulled aside just in time to let the rush go by. Bamboo and Who's Who shortened stride to give The Cat room, and Lutyens got the goal with a clean, smooth, smacking stroke that was heard all over the field. But there was no stopping the ponies. They poured through the goalposts in one mixed mob, winners and losers together, for the pace had been terrific. The Maltese Cat knew by experience what would happen, and, to save Lutyens, turned to the right with one last effort, that strained a back-sinew beyond hope of repair. As he did so he heard the right-hand goalpost crack as a pony cannoned into it--crack, splinter and fall like a mast. It had been sawed three parts through in case of accidents, but it upset the pony nevertheless, and he blundered into another, who blundered into the left-hand post, and then there was confusion and dust and wood. Bamboo was lying on the ground, seeing stars; an Archangel pony rolled beside him, breathless and angry; Shikast had sat down dog-fashion to avoid falling over the others, and was sliding along on his little bobtail in a cloud of dust; and Powell was sitting on the ground, hammering with his stick and trying to cheer. All the others were shouting at the top of what was left of their voices, and the men who had been spilt were shouting too. As soon as the people saw no one was hurt, ten thousand native and English shouted and clapped and yelled, and before any one could stop them the pipers of the Skidars broke on to the ground, with all the native officers and men behind them, and marched up and down, playing a wild Northern tune called [...] "Zakhme Began," [...] and through the insolent blaring of the pipes and the high-pitched native yells you could hear the Archangels' band hammering, [...] "For they are all jolly good fellows," [...] and then reproachfully to the losing team, [...] "Ooh, Kafoozalum! Kafoozalum! Kafoozalum!" ...|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} with the Cardinals, Hrabosky became a fan {{favorite}} for his antics on the mound. Between each pitch he would turn {{his back to the}} batter, walk towards second base, vigorously rub the ball between his palms several times, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> pound the ball into his mitt. He would then storm back to the mound, staring down the batter. Although the crowd would roar in delight, most batters were not fond of the pitcher's routine.|$|E

5000|$|Lambert {{said that}} the song is [...] "about slowing down, taking a breath and remembering what it's like to live life a little more simply.
