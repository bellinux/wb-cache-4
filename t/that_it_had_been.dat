5|$|Russell's {{teaching}} that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built under God's direction was overturned in 1928, when Rutherford asserted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> built {{under the direction}} of Satan for the purpose of deceiving God's people in the last days. The announcement prompted further defections among long-time Bible Students.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} never {{fared well}} in captivity. The oldest {{lived to be}} 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild.

5|$|The defense {{continued}} a {{few more}} days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man.

5|$|The monastery is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in the early 14th century, although Yevgeniy Bolkhovitinov claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> founded by the first Metropolitan of Kiev, Michael, along with Greek monks arriving from Byzantium in 988 AD. The claim is likely spurious, since Mezhyhirya is not listed by modern authors among the monasteries of Kievan Rus.|$|E

5|$|After Kerr {{resigned}} as Governor-General, he still sought a government position, reasoning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his intent to remain {{for ten years}} as Governor-General. However, Fraser's attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to UNESCO (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such public outcry that the nomination was withdrawn.

5|$|Another {{political}} pirate was the Miners pirate {{radio station}} dubbed Radio Arthur by the media, which operated in the Nottinghamshire area during the 1984/1985 miners strike; downloads {{of some of}} its programmes are available on www.g0mrf.com. This station transmitted over the top of Radio Trent on both mediumwave using 3500 watts and VHF using 800 watts or more. Mentioned in a House of Lords debate in Hansard as Radio Scargill, it was stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> actively pursued and closed down by the authorities; however this was incorrect and the people involved were never caught. Other recordings of Radio Arthur are on the Pirate Archive website.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|As Hogue {{approached}} her sinking sister, her captain, Wilmot Nicholson, realized <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a submarine attack and signaled Cressy {{to look for}} a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed and sank at 07:15.|$|E

5|$|Black Hawk was {{determined}} to hold onto Saukenuk, where he lived and had been born. When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, they found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> occupied by white squatters who were anticipating the sale of land. After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth {{that he and his}} followers would not return to Saukenuk.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{deposited}} {{on top of a}} layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
