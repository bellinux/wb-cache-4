If there are two vertices in the cover, augment G by adding an edge (corresponding to v) that connects these two vertices. If {{there is only one}} vertex in the cover, then add a new vertex to G, adjacent to this vertex.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} an {{implicit}} graph is common in various search algorithms which are {{described in terms of}} graphs. In this context, an implicit graph may be [...] defined as a set of rules to define all neighbors for any specified vertex. This type of implicit graph representation is analogous to an adjacency list, in that it provides easy access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> of each vertex. For instance, in searching for a solution to a puzzle such as Rubik's Cube, one may define an implicit graph in which each vertex represents one of the possible states of the cube, and each edge represents a move from one state to another. It is straightforward to generate the neighbors of any vertex by trying all possible moves in the puzzle and determining the states reached by each of these moves; however, an implicit representation is necessary, as the state space of Rubik's Cube is too large to allow an algorithm to list all of its states. states, and is too large to search exhaustively.}} ...|$|E

And in those cases the corpse was always left till the officers had notice to come and take them away, or till night, when the bearers attending the dead cart would take them up and carry them away.

60|$|All the {{inhabitants}} of the little village are busy. One is clearing a spot on the verge of the forest for his homestead; another is hewing the trunk of a fallen pine tree, in order to build himself a dwelling; a third is hoeing in his field of Indian corn. Here comes a huntsman out of the woods, dragging a bear which he has shot, and shouting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> to lend him a hand. There goes a man to the sea-shore, with a spade and a bucket, to dig a mess of clams, which were a principal article of food with the first settlers. Scattered here and there are two or three dusky figures, clad in mantles of fur, with ornaments of bone hanging from their ears, and the feathers of wild birds in their coal black hair. They have belts of shell-work slung across their shoulders, and are armed with bows and arrows and flint-headed spears. These are an Indian Sagamore and his attendants, who have come to gaze at the labors of the white men. And now rises a cry, that a pack of wolves have seized a young calf in the pasture; and every man snatches up his gun or pike, and runs in chase of the marauding beasts.|$|E
60|$|One day she {{had come}} upon the rotting ribs of a wreck on the beach. Its {{distance}} from the tide line, its position, and its deep imbedding of sand, showed that it was of ancient origin. An omnivorous reader of all that pertained {{to the history of}} California, Jenny had in fancy often sailed the seas in one of those mysterious treasure-ships that had skirted the coast in bygone days, and she at once settled in her mind that her discovery was none other than a castaway Philippine galleon. Partly from her reserve, and partly from a suddenly conceived plan, she determined to keep its existence unknown to her father, as careful inquiry on her part had found it was equally unknown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors.</b> For this shy, imaginative young girl of eighteen had convinced herself that it might still contain a part of its old treasure. She would dig for it herself, without telling anybody. If she failed, no one would know it; if she were successful, she would surprise her father and perhaps retrieve their fortune by less vulgar means than their present toil. Thanks to the secluded locality {{and the fact that she}} was known to spend her leisure moments in wandering there, she could work without suspicion. Secretly conveying a shovel and a few tools to the spot the next day, she set about her prodigious task. As the upper works were gone, and the galleon not large, in three weeks, working an hour or two each day, she had made a deep excavation in the stern. She had found many curious things,--the flotsam and jetsam of previous storms,--but as yet, it is perhaps needless to say, not the treasure.|$|E
6000|$|The storm raged violently as Hays {{emerged from}} {{the last of a}} long range of {{outbuildings}} and sheds, and crossed the open space between him and the farmhouse. Before he had reached the porch, with its scant shelter, he had floundered through a snowdrift, and faced the full fury of the storm. But the snow seemed to have glanced from his hard angular figure as it had from his roof-ridge, for when he entered the narrow hall-way his pilot jacket was unmarked, except where a narrow line of powdered flakes outlined the seams as if worn. To the right was an apartment, half office, half sitting-room, furnished with a dark and chilly iron safe, a sofa and chairs covered with black and coldly shining horsehair. Here Hays not only removed his upper coat but his under one also, and drawing a chair before the fire sat down in his shirt-sleeves. It was his usual rustic pioneer habit, and might have been some lingering reminiscence of certain remote ancestors to whom clothes were an impediment. He was warming his hands and placidly ignoring his gaunt arms in their thinly-clad [...] "hickory" [...] sleeves, when a young girl of eighteen sauntered, half perfunctorily, half inquisitively into the room. It was his only remaining daughter. Already elected by circumstances to a dry household virginity, her somewhat large features, sallow complexion, and tasteless, unattractive dress, did not obviously suggest a sacrifice. Since her sister's departure she had taken sole charge of her father's domestic affairs and the few rude servants he employed, with a certain inherited following of his own moods and methods. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> she was known as [...] "Miss Hays,"--a dubious respect that, in a community of familiar [...] "Sallies," [...] "Mamies," [...] "Pussies," [...] was grimly prophetic. Yet she rejoiced in the Oriental appellation of [...] "Zuleika." [...] To this it is needless to add {{that it was impossible to}} conceive any one who looked more decidedly Western.|$|E
