5|$|There {{has been}} some {{evidence}} that prior to this charter, the royal heralds had already in some ways behaved like a corporation as early as 1420. Nevertheless, the charter is the earliest surviving document <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> chapter as a corporate body of heralds. The charter outlines {{the constitution of the}} officers, their hierarchy, the privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in the Kingdom of England.|$|E
5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|By 1166, Foliot {{had been}} {{presented}} with a petition for annulment of the marriage of Aubrey de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. On the couple's third appearance before the bishop in his episcopal court on 9May 1166, Countess Agnes appealed to the pope <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> validity of her marriage. Foliot enclosed her appeal in his own surviving letter setting out the salient features of the case. While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded the earl for his treatment of his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When Pope Alexander III wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten the earl with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for {{his handling of the}} case.|$|E

5|$|Initially the new {{government}} had little success, but in 1220 the fortunes of Henry's government began to improve. The Pope allowed Henry to be crowned for a second time, using {{a new set of}} royal regalia. The fresh coronation was intended <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> authority of the King; Henry promised to restore the powers of the Crown, and the barons swore that they would give back the royal castles and pay their debts to the Crown, on the threat of excommunication. Hubert, accompanied by Henry, moved into Wales to suppress Llywelyn in 1223, and in England his forces steadily reclaimed Henry's castles. The effort against the remaining recalcitrant barons came to a head in 1224 with the siege of Bedford Castle, which Henry and Hubert besieged for eight weeks; when it finally fell, almost all of the garrison were executed.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|Bullion prices {{continued}} to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone {{forced to sell}} at melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value. Despite the support of Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, {{the question of the}} redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new Morgan dollar under the inflationary Bland–Allison Act. Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts which so provided. It was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars. The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland–Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887, when the ten-day period which President Grover Cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President. Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> coin's silver content. The dollars were only redeemable for six months, and the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{controversial}} nature of the case, it garnered much attention from many groups {{on both sides of}} the gun rights issue.

25|$|While the Filioque {{doctrine}} was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose Tome {{was approved}} at the Council of Chalcedon, its {{inclusion in the}} Creed appeared in the anti-Arian situation of 7th-century Spain. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East. The Filioque, included in the Creed by certain anti-Arian councils in Spain, was a means <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> full divinity of the Son in relation to both the Father and the Spirit.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgement}} of {{the district}} court was unanimously upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in March 2009.

Williams wrote that the scientific literature clearly supported the city's grooming regulation, but that this issue had not been raised by city attorneys in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|After hearing oral {{arguments}} in the case, the Supreme Court was conflicted as to the outcome. The papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall, released nearly a decade later, reveal {{that a majority of}} justices were initially inclined <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit. Justice Harry Blackmun was assigned to write a majority opinion to that effect, while Justice John Paul Stevens drafted a dissenting opinion. Sensing that some members of the Court might be persuaded to change their votes, Stevens wrote a dissent that read like a majority opinion, and could be changed to one with the substitution of a few words.|$|E

5000|$|It {{may or may}} not be {{the case}} that [...] "all Z is B," [...] but this is {{irrelevant}} to the conclusion. What is relevant to the conclusion is whether it is true that [...] "all B is Z," [...] which is ignored in the argument. The fallacy is similar <b>to</b> <b>affirming</b> <b>the</b> consequent and denying the antecedent. However, the fallacy may be resolved if the terms are exchanged in either the conclusion or in the first co-premise. Indeed, from the perspective of first-order logic, all cases of the fallacy of the undistributed middle are, in fact, examples of <b>affirming</b> <b>the</b> consequent or denying the antecedent, depending on the structure of the fallacious argument.|$|R
25|$|In 646, Emperor Taizong, in the aftermaths of the {{collapse}} of Tang's one-time vassal and adversary Xueyantuo to the north, went to the important northern defense prefecture of Ling Prefecture (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), to try <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> faith of the former vassals of Xueyantuo, who were by now directly Tang vassals. Initially, he was taking Li Zhi with him, but Zhang submitted a petition stating that this would better serve as an opportunity for Li Zhi to serve as regent at Chang'an, so that he could become familiar with imperial governance. Emperor Taizong agreed, and rewarded Zhang by giving him the honorific title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (銀青光祿大夫).|$|E

Today, Taoist practices are predominant in Guan Yu worship. Many temples dedicated to Guan Yu, including the Emperor Guan Temple in Xiezhou County, show heavy Taoist influence. Every year, on the 24th day of the sixth month on the lunar calendar (legendary birthday of Guan Yu, Guan was actually born on the 22nd day of the sixth month of 160), a street parade in the honour of Guan Yu would also be held.|$|E
25|$|The {{impossibility of}} the {{physical}} presence of the monarch was replaced by viceroys, the post of viceroy the direct representation of the monarch. The functions of the viceroy were: governor, captain general, president of the Audiencia, superintendent of the Royal Treasury and vicepatronage of the Church. Thus, the territories of the viceroyalties emerged <b>to</b> <b>affirm</b> <b>the</b> authority of the king in a specific territory. The territory which comprised the viceroyalty was divided in provinces —also called governorates— headed by the governor. In the 16th century the Spanish overseas territories were divided in two viceroyalties: New Spain (1535) for North America, Antilles, the Philippines and Venezuela, and Peru (1542) for South America, which was divided in the 18th century.|$|E
