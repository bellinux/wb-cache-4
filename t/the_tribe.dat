The Clan cats discover that <b>the</b> <b>Tribe</b> cats have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a savage lion-like creature that has been killing many members of <b>the</b> <b>Tribe.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tribe</b> thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy, and he is therefore expected to protect <b>the</b> <b>Tribe</b> from Sharptooth.

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. <b>The</b> <b>tribe</b> made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> came to an agreement in 2009, where <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E

5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> would be withdrawn and <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. <b>The</b> <b>tribe</b> and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. <b>The</b> <b>tribe</b> was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. <b>The</b> <b>tribe</b> was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of <b>the</b> <b>tribe,</b> but extinguished <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> and with it all treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of <b>the</b> <b>tribe,</b> citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of <b>the</b> <b>tribe.</b> Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> had a right to assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tribe</b> was {{represented}} by Charles A.

Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>tribe</b> claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims.
