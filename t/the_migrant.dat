5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015, Cumberbatch {{condemned}} the UK government's response to <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> crisis {{in a speech}} to theatregoers during a curtain call at a performance of Hamlet, for which he stars. He also fronted a video campaign to help the charity Save The Children in its mission to aid young Syrian refugees. He was one of the signatories of an open letter, published in The Guardian, criticising the government for its actions regarding the refugee problem. He also gave nightly speeches after his curtain call as Hamlet at the Barbican in London, asking for donations to help Syrian refugees. At the end of the run, the audience contributed more than £150,000 for Save the Children.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} set up where {{migrants}} must choose a level of social traits and consumption of ethnic goods. As the consumption level of ethnic goods increases, <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> become ever more different to the local population and are less assimilated. Less assimilation affects {{the reaction of the}} local population to <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> and <b>the</b> willingness of the local population to accept them. This affects wages and unemployment. We show that increasing the unemployment social benefits of <b>migrants</b> increases <b>the</b> consumption of ethnic goods, thus creating a trap wherein the willingness of the local population to accept <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> into <b>the</b> economy decreases and so increases the probability of the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> on <b>the</b> welfare state...|$|R

50|$|The Pitcairn government's {{attempts}} to attract migrants have been unsuccessful. Since 2013, some 700 make inquiries each year, but so far, {{not a single}} formal settlement application has been received. <b>The</b> <b>migrants</b> are prohibited from taking local jobs or claiming benefits for a certain length of time, even those with children. <b>The</b> <b>migrants</b> {{are expected to have}} at least NZ$30000 per person in savings and are expected to build their own house at average cost of NZ$140000. It is also possible to bring the off-island builders at the additional cost between NZ$23000 and NZ$28000. The average annual cost of living on the island is NZ$9464. There is, however, no assurance of <b>the</b> <b>migrant's</b> right to remain on Pitcairn; after their first two years, the council must review and reapprove <b>the</b> <b>migrant's</b> status. <b>The</b> <b>migrants</b> are also required {{to take part in the}} unpaid public work to keep the island in order: maintain the island's numerous roads and paths, build roads, navigate the island longboats, clean public toilets etc. There are also restrictions on bringing children under the age of 16 to the island.|$|R
5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first migrant workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, <b>the</b> <b>Migrant</b> Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus peregrinator, {{described}} by Sundevall in 1837, {{is known as}} the Indian peregrine falcon, Shaheen falcon, Indian shaheen or shaheen falcon. It was formerly sometimes known as Falco atriceps or Falco shaheen. Its range includes South Asia from Pakistan across India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Southeastern China. In India, the shaheen is reported from all states except Uttar Pradesh, mainly from rocky and hilly regions. The Shaheen is also reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It has a clutch size of 3 to 4 eggs, with the chicks fledging time of 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest. In India, apart from nesting on cliffs, it has also been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and cellphone transmission towers. A population estimate of 40 breeding pairs in Sri Lanka was made in 1996. It is non-migratory, and is small and dark, with rufous underparts. In Sri Lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> calidus is more often seen along the coast.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in <b>the</b> previous section, <b>migrants</b> have substantially lower wages than non-migrants (Table  1). However, Table  3 shows that once observed variables are controlled, {{the gap in}} monthly wages between <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants is very small and not statistically significant. It means that the gap in wages between <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> and non-migrants is mainly explained by {{the differences in the}} control variables.|$|R

25|$|Runaway migrant {{domestic}} {{workers are}} former-live in {{workers who have}} left their sponsor {{for a variety of}} reasons.

25|$|In {{order to}} recruit migrant {{domestic}} workers, Lebanese recruitment agencies collaborate with agencies in <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> sending countries. Migrant domestic workers {{are required to}} pay a fee to the local agent in their home country, usually a large sum of money which causes them to incur a large debt. Once the fee transaction is complete the agency arranges the transportation. The employer is obliged to meet <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> worker at the airport gate where a general security guard who holds the employee's passport will hand it over directly to the employer. A medical examination and the resulting report must be fulfilled before the work permit is issued and the insurance for the worker must be paid by the employer within three months. A standard unified contract is drawn up which is more in favour of the employer than <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> worker.|$|E

30|$|Nearly half <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> were {{unemployed}} {{before they}} left for the first time, {{and most of them}} worked in agriculture and construction. Roughly 84 % of <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> come back {{at least once a year}} or go back and forth on a regular basis. While abroad, 85 % communicate with household members at least once a week or more often. Thus, <b>the</b> connection between <b>migrants</b> and those left behind is by all means quite close. On average, 63 % of <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> have a work permit for their destination country. In the destination countries, <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> work mostly in the construction sector or have individual household employers, i.e., sectors that are likely to have a low education premium. The remittances generated by these migrants make up about 46 % of the total household income of migrant households in Moldova.

25|$|When the {{employers}} {{were asked about}} the kafala system, 55.8% wanted the system to change. The {{reason for this is}} that {{the employers}} felt that the burden was too high on them. In fact the figure increased to 65% when the employers were informed of the obligation to reimburse the recruitment fees in case of an early termination of contract by <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> workers. A large amount of the employers even felt that <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> workers should not be included in the Lebanese labour code, out of fear of the expansion of these rights to other foreigners like the Syrian or Palestinian refugees.|$|E
25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process of}} a migrant domestic worker into Lebanon is conducted by sponsorship. The worker has {{to receive an}} invitation before being granted a working permit to enter the country. The invitation comes through a recruiting agency either by use of the services of {{their counterparts in the}} worker’s country of origin or directly from the agency itself and sometimes at the request of an individual employer. First, the Ministry of Labour issues preliminary work authorization to migrant domestic workers. In 2010, the Ministry of Labour issued and approximate 118,000 work permits to migrant domestic Workers. Next, the Ministry of Interior issues entry visas through the General Directorate for General Security. Then the General Directorate of General Security authorizes the legal entry of migrant domestic workers and arranges work permission and residence when they arrived in the country. Lastly, the sponsor’s name is located on <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> domestic worker's entry visa, residence and work permit. The visa is for a three-month period {{and the name of the}} sponsor is included in the passport. When <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> domestic worker arrives at the airport they are subjected to an immigration routine which includes the handing over of their passports to the Lebanese General Security in order to process the papers, while <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> domestic worker waits to be collected by their sponsor. After this, the sponsor brings <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> domestic worker to a local agency for a basic medical checkup.|$|E
