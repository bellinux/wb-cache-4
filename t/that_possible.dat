The presence of fecal coliform (chiefly Enterococcus and Escherichia coli) can be attributed both to residential septic and sewage systems and to farm animals and wildlife.

25|$|Durham Dynamos {{contrived}} to {{lose this}} one, having first had Leicestershire Foxes on the rack after limiting them {{to a total of}} 150 for 9. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made <b>that</b> <b>possible,</b> but he was later to be the main culprit as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets and refused to give him runs. He eventually finished on 18 from 17 balls, making the task of Gareth Breese and Gordon Muchall impossible - and Durham finished an agonising three runs short.|$|E

25|$|Both Conway's and Jensen's {{versions}} of the transfer-matrix method involve {{counting the number of}} polyominoes that have a certain width. Computing the number for all widths gives the total number of polyominoes. The basic idea behind the method is <b>that</b> <b>possible</b> beginning rows are considered, and then to determine the minimum number of squares needed to complete the polyomino of the given width. Combined with the use of generating functions, this technique is able to count many polyominoes at once, thus enabling it to run many times faster than methods that have to generate every polyomino.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos {{lost their}} second game in succession, having bowled first and taken nine Leicestershire Foxes wickets, while their opponents made 150 runs. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made <b>that</b> <b>possible,</b> but he scored at a strike rate 22 points below the required, hitting 18 off 17 balls, while as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets {{and refused to}} give him runs Gareth Breese hit 16 not out off 8 balls, and Gordon Muchall 38 not out off 30, but they couldn't carry Durham all the way, and they {{finished}} four runs short of victory.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regard to}} whether two given propositions {{can have the}} same truth value, there are four {{separate}} logical possibilities: the propositions are subalterns (possibly both are true, and possibly both are false); subcontraries (it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are true, but not that both are false); contraries (it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are false, but not that both are true); or contradictories (it is not <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are true, {{and it is not}} <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are false).|$|R
40|$|Gemes (2009) argued that, {{given that}} I believe that I have hands and I {{believe that it}} is not the case that I have a hand with a wart on it, it must be the case that at least one of my experience-based beliefs (EBBs) is true. This follows since the contradictions of those two propositions {{believed}} by me are jointly inconsistent. Gemes (2009) concluded that this refutes the sceptical claim <b>that</b> it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's EBBs are false. The first section of this article addresses some objections to the argument of Gemes (2009). The second section develops new counter-examples to the claim <b>that</b> it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's EBBs are false, and then argues that they are also counter-examples to the claim <b>that</b> it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's direct, that is, perceptual, EBBs are false. The third section presents counter-examples to the claim <b>that</b> it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's positive, that is, existential entailing, EBBs are false. Readers who are already convinced of the soundness of the argument of Gemes (2009) might skip the first section of this article...|$|R

The day after the shooting, Prime Minister Harper pledged to expedite plans to boost security forces' surveillance, detention, and arrest powers; other members of the government indicated consideration was being made toward ways to magnify anti-terrorism laws.|$|E
25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication {{that sounds like a}} short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show <b>that</b> <b>possible</b> causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E

The presence of shell middens and refuse heaps at the site will afford an opportunity to study subsistence patterns as well as possibly some information on the paleoenvironment. The burials and associated grave goods will provide an insight into social, religious, ceremonial/symbolic systems of these occupants, as well as provide information on prehistoric demographic patterns, nutrition, disease and other prehistoric population characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Any {{historical}} or current presence of similar groups of residents among the western population is currently unknown, however, whalers' logbooks and scientific observations indicate <b>that</b> <b>possible</b> year-round occurrences in Chinese waters and Yellow and Bohai basins {{were likely to}} be summering grounds. Some of the better documented historical catches show that it was common for whales to stay for months in enclosed waters elsewhere, with known records in the Seto Inland Sea and the Gulf of Tosa. Former feeding areas were once spread over large portions on mid-Honshu to northern Hokkaido, and at least whales were recorded for majority of annual seasons including wintering periods at least along east coasts of Korean Peninsula and Yamaguchi Prefecture. Some recent observations indicate that historic presences of resident whales are possible: a group of two or three were observed feeding in Izu Ōshima in 1994 for almost a month, two single individuals stayed in Ise Bay for almost two months in the 1980s and in 2012, the first confirmed living individuals in Japanese EEZ in the Sea of Japan and the first of living cow-calf pairs since the end of whaling stayed for about three weeks on the coastline of Teradomari in 2014. One of the pair returned to the same coasts at the same time of the year in 2015 again. Reviewing on other cases on different locations among Japanese coasts and islands observed during 2015 indicate that spatial or seasonal residencies regardless of being temporal or permanental staying once occurred throughout many parts of Japan or on other coastal Asia.|$|E
