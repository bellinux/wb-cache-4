50|$|The <b>three-way</b> <b>catalyst</b> {{developed}} by Keith and chemical engineer John J.

50|$|Automotive oxygen sensors, colloquially {{known as}} O2 ("ō two") sensors, make modern {{electronic}} fuel injection and emission control possible. They help determine, in real time, if the air-fuel ratio of a combustion engine is rich or lean. Since oxygen sensors {{are located in the}} exhaust stream, they do not directly measure the air or the fuel entering the engine but when information from oxygen sensors is coupled with information from other sources, {{it can be used to}} indirectly determine the air-fuel ratio. Closed loop feedback-controlled fuel injection varies the fuel injector output according to real-time sensor data rather than operating with a predetermined (open-loop) fuel map. In addition to enabling {{electronic fuel injection}} to work efficiently, this emissions control technique can reduce the amounts of both unburnt fuel and oxides of nitrogen entering the atmosphere. Unburnt fuel is pollution in the form of air-borne hydrocarbons, while oxides of nitrogen (NOx gases) are a result of combustion chamber temperatures exceeding 1,300 kelvin due to excess air in the fuel mixture and contribute to smog and acid rain. Volvo was the first automobile manufacturer to employ this technology in the late 1970s, along with the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalyst</b> used in the catalytic converter.|$|E

40|$|Using {{multicomponent}} gas feeds, {{the formation}} of ammonia from nitric oxide over Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Pd/Ce/Al 2 O 3 model catalysts was {{compared to that of}} a commercially-available <b>three-way</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Steady- state oxygen-sweep experiments show that the highest activity for ammonia formation is obtained over the Pd/Ce/Al 2 O 3 catalyst whilst the lowest activity is observed for the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The latter is consid- ered to be linked to the incorporation of rhodium, a component that promotes the NOx reduction selectivity towards N 2. Also, lean/rich cycling experiments were carried out to simulate the cycling conditions that passive-SCR after treatment systems depend upon. High activity is again seen over the Pd/Ce/Al 2 O 3 cata- lyst during short periodic switches. For the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalyst,</b> longer periodic switches are required for the onset of ammonia formation due to the high oxygen storage capacity of this sample as compared to the other two. Hence, a future direction of investigation could be to develop materials with equivalent water- gas shift properties of ceria, but with reduced oxygen storage capacity so as to provide hydrogen for reaction without incurring a significant delay in ammonia formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} rate for ammonia from in-use vehicles {{is calculated based on}} measurements made inside a Los Angeles roadway tunnel. Using fleet distributions by vehicle age and type, known catalyst distributions, and fuel economy by model year and vehicle type and attributing all ammonia to {{vehicles equipped with}} <b>three-way</b> <b>catalysts</b> or <b>three-way</b> <b>catalysts</b> plus oxidizing catalysts (dual-bed catalysts), we estimate an average ammonia {{emission rate}} of 72 mg km^(- 1) for these vehicles, or 61 mg km^(- 1) driven by the vehicle fleet as a whole. These emissions can emanate from vehicles running under rich air−fuel conditions, with three-way catalytic converters designed to reduce NO_x to N_ 2 and O_ 2 in addition forming NH_ 3. Resulting calculations estimate ammonia emissions of 24 − 29 t of NH_ 3 day^(- 1) from the vehicle fleet for the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) that surrounds Los Angeles. This represents an increase in the daily emissions of ammonia attributable to motor vehicles in the SoCAB from 2 % of basin wide emissions before the introduction of catalyst-equipped automobiles to 15 % based on the current experiment. The air basin wide emission rate of ammonia from motor vehicles is compared to ammonia emissions from livestock waste decomposition at local dairies, and the implications for control of fine particle ammonium nitrate concentrations are discussed...|$|R
