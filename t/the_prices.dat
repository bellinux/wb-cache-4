According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure.

40|$|Many {{valuation}} {{models in}} financial economics are developed using <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel approach {{to adjust for}} risk through the equivalent martingale representation. Often it is assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel exhibits constant elasticity with respect to <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> market portfolio. In a representative agent economy this would be close to assuming that the representative agent has constant proportional risk aversion. The elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel has also implications for <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> of options. This paper shows, first, that given <b>the</b> forward <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> market portfolio, all European options would have higher <b>prices</b> if <b>the</b> elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel was declining instead of constant. Moreover, a volatility smile-effect is generated. Second, the paper shows that the standard geometric Brownian motion underlying the Black/Scholes model requires constant elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel. Third, if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> market portfolio at the expiration date of an option is lognormally distributed, then declining elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel implies a stochastic process which is characterized by higher volatility and negative autocorrelation. Thus, declining elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel can explain several empirical findings. ...|$|R
