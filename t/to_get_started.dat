5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started</b> presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E
5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started</b> in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started</b> again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

If the prostate grows too large, it may constrict the urethra and impede the flow of urine, making urination difficult and painful and, in extreme cases, completely impossible.|$|E

25|$|No {{enrichment}} {{and fuel}} element fabrication. Since 100% of natural thorium {{can be used}} as a fuel, and the fuel is in the form of a molten salt instead of solid fuel rods, expensive fuel enrichment and solid fuel rods' validation procedures and fabricating processes are not needed. This greatly decreases LFTR fuel costs. Even if the LFTR is started up on enriched uranium, it only needs this enrichment once just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started.</b> After startup, no further enrichment is required.|$|E
25|$|Less fissile fuel needed. Because LFTRs are thermal {{spectrum}} reactors, they need much less fissile fuel <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started.</b> Only 1-2 tons of fissile {{are required to}} start up a single fluid LFTR, and potentially as low as 0.4 ton for a two fluid design. In comparison, solid fueled fast breeder reactors need at least 8 tons of fissile fuel to start the reactor. While fast reactors can theoretically start up very well on the transuranic waste, their high fissile fuel startup makes this very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for New Zealand, most {{of these}} {{projects}} only came on line {{at the same time}} as oil prices dropped during the 1980s oil glut. The price of crude went from more than US$90 a barrel in 1980, to about US$30 a few years later. Because these Think Big projects required massive borrowing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started,</b> public debt soared from $4.2 billion in 1975 when Muldoon became Prime Minister to $21.9 billion when he left office nine years later. Inflation remained rampant, averaging 11% in the 1980s. Once Labour came to power in 1984, many of these projects were sold to private industry as part of a wider sale of state-assets.|$|E

This production did not go nearly as smoothly, and a continual stream of minor changes from Curtiss-Wright (in turn demanded by the U.S. Navy) meant that full-scale production {{took a long time}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started.</b> In the midst of this project MacGill and the works manager, E. J. (Bill) Soulsby, were dismissed.

25|$|A great escape {{looked on}} the cards when Middlesbrough went a goal up {{at home to}} Aston Villa in their {{penultimate}} game of the season, courtesy of an overhead kick from Tuncay. Boro were dealt a huge blow however, when Stewart Downing was brought down under a challenge from Stiliyan Petrov, and needed treatment. He was able to briefly continue before needing to be substituted. John Carew brought Villa level when Boro failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started</b> again in the second half. The visitors looked most likely to score again as they continued to press forward, while Boro needed to get forward themselves in their relegation fight. The game eventually ended in a 1–1 draw, with Boro needing a miracle in the final game to avoid the drop.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} is more {{malleable}} than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, {{to adapt to}} new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves {{through a series of}} gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started,</b> as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).|$|E

25|$|Pop {{and rock}} were slow <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started</b> in Scotland and {{produced}} few bands of {{note in the}} 1950s or 1960s, though thanks to accolades by David Bowie and others, the Edinburgh-based band 1-2-3 (later Clouds), active 1966–71, have belatedly been acknowledged as a definitive precursor of the progressive rock movement. However, by the 1970s bands such as the Average White Band, Nazareth, and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band began to have international success. The biggest Scottish pop act of the 1970s however (at {{least in terms of}} sales) were undoubtedly the Bay City Rollers; a spinoff band formed by former Rollers members, Pilot, also enjoyed some success. Several {{of the members of the}} internationally successful rock band AC/DC were born in Scotland, including original lead singer Bon Scott and guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young, though by the time they began playing, all three had moved to Australia. George Young, Angus and Malcolm's older brother, found success as a member of the Australian band The Easybeats, later produced some of AC/DC's records and formed a songwriting partnership with Dutch expat Harry Vanda. Similarly Mark Knopfler was partly raised in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, Waterfront Toronto (the former TWRC) {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} the segment from Jarvis Street to the Don River and construction of a widened Lake Shore Boulevard {{in the style of}} University Avenue at a projected cost of $200 to $300 million. The proposal shelved the previous plan to demolish the central section and the construction of the Front Street Extension. Waterfront Toronto proposed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>started</b> on the environmental assessment of the demolition, which is expected to take up to five years and cost $10 million. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong criticized the proposal, pointing out that the city already had a $300 million backlog of road repairs. Mayor David Miller endorsed the proposal, noting that the funds for the demolition and the eight-lane boulevard would come from monies saved by not building the Front Street Extension, and money saved on the maintenance of the elevated highway. In July 2008, City Council voted to proceed with the environmental assessment. In March 2009, Waterfront Toronto started the environmental assessment consultation process, with open houses and an online consultation web site. The Terms of Reference were approved by City Council in May 2009 and the Government of Ontario in September 2009 and an Environmental Assessment was expected to start in April 2010.|$|E
