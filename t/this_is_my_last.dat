500|$|Nixon ran for Governor of California against {{incumbent}} Pat Brown, and {{was defeated}} handily, leading {{the media to}} label him as a [...] "loser." [...] This defeat was widely {{believed to be the}} end of his career; in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon famously blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> press conference." [...] In September, the New York Post published an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with Nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses. He moved to New York, joining the Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon law firm, and regrouped, considering but decided against a run for president in 1964, beginning to plan for a 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E
500|$|Some time later, Rose has a dream {{where she}} hears the Doctor's voice calling her. The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay, where a {{holographic}} image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, I suppose, if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> chance to say it: Rose Tyler—"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. In the TARDIS, tears run down the Doctor's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course. As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. With the Doctor shocked and confused, the mysterious bride angrily demands to know where she is, leading {{to the events of}} [...] "The Runaway Bride".|$|E

500|$|Local and {{national}} Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election. Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race. The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the {{office as a}} stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own {{lack of interest in}} being California's governor. Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics. Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed {{to be the end of}} his political career. In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> press conference". The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of ABC's [...] entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon". Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air, and public sympathy for Nixon grew.|$|E
