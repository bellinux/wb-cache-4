2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
60|$|So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> As far as {{the junior}} day-room was concerned, Pillingshot felt himself vindicated.|$|E
60|$|La Hire {{said that}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> he wasn't {{going to kill}} the {{voluntary}} ones, but only the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Miss Smithers," [...] {{said the}} captain, with a jolly laugh. [...] "You are my guest, and I shall take no denial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right? No! How can a wood like <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> {{without a}} man about the place who knows {{anything}} {{of the nature of}} a fox? In your grandfather's time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, missie, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> now. You {{can keep}} off {{the ghost of}} the dead Englishwoman while I kill Baas Frank. But first he must be fast asleep. Fast, fast asleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right!</b> He {{could not}} argue with me while so {{important}} a person engaged him. [...] . I came boldly down the steps.|$|E
6000|$|MEPHISTOPHELES: <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> my friend: Be {{it enough}} that the mouse was not gray. [...] 375 Do not disturb your hour of {{happiness}} With close consideration of such trifles.|$|E
6000|$|Did {{anyone ever}} hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who {{ever heard of}} ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Kitty; I {{agree with}} you {{this is not the}} best place in the world for her, and I think it likely that I may take her away altogether.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Been 'aving {{a little}} nap?" [...] he asked, looking gayly down on Northwick's bewildered face. [...] "Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right!</b> We have supper, now, pretty soon. You hungry? Well, in a 'alf-hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Moussa," [...] my host answered. [...] "I am {{not feeling}} very well to-night, though, and I should much prefer {{if you would}} stay on the island." ...|$|R
6000|$|It's still dicky, though, if {{that fellow}} at the back gets up again; the old chap can't work that stop a second time. 'Ah! here was 'old Apple-pie' on his hind legs. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] said he. [...] "Last time I {{was blown}} {{up in my}} bunk, too. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> So I think, now, too, I stay in my bunk here. It is cold upstairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, {{you must}} know, Corny, here, and I, and Dirck there, {{went in to}} see the lion, about which no doubt you've heard so much, and Corny paid for Miss's ticket Well, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> enough, but----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> I <b>am</b> {{glad you}} sent it, {{as he would}} {{be looking for a}} letter from me. I suppose you <b>are</b> quite sure <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> a negro who stabbed me?' ...|$|R
60|$|Jack. Oh, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Cecily <b>is</b> not a silly romantic girl, I {{am glad to}} say. She has got {{a capital}} appetite, goes long walks, and pays no {{attention}} at all to her lessons.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Cause I don't {{think it}} would be nice to talk to God before strangers, Anne. Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes, but I won't. I'll wait till she's gone and then say 'em. Won't <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Anne?" ...|$|R
60|$|When we surmounted the slope, and {{eventually}} reached camp, I found Isbel entertaining strangers, men of rough garb, evidently riders of the range. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but I {{did not like}} his prodigality with our swiftly diminishing store of eatables.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{they were}} {{that he was to}} have a key of the house. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Lodgers often have them. Also, that he was to be left entirely to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> He {{might not}} look in that drawer for hours. I {{glanced at his}} clock. Twenty minutes still before the Birmingham train. Time to buy a pair of boots and get away. But how I was {{to get to the}} station? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> enough; {{but unless}} <b>that</b> comes, there <b>is</b> nothing to wake one. The close {{air of the}} forest takes out what little starch you have in you, and I verily believe <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> very often asleep, as we march." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> I think, myself, <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> for the best. Of course, it must <b>be</b> {{understood}} <b>that,</b> in {{the matter}} of religion, she is not to be forced or urged in any sort of way; but is to be allowed to follow the religion in which she has been brought up." ...|$|R
60|$|Mike said {{he thought}} <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> The {{pantomime}} dame exhibited no pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{leaping from}} side to side of the grating, making {{threatening}} jabs with his broken spear. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> It would keep the Selenites down--for a time at any rate. I looked up the cavern again. What on earth were we going to do now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And their complexions," [...] said Mr. Direck, {{over the}} pyramid of fruit, quite manifestly {{intending}} a compliment. So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right....</b> But {{the girl on}} the left of him was speaking across the table to the German tutor, and did not hear what he had said. So that even if it wasn't very neat it didn't matter....|$|E
60|$|She said to {{him ever}} so many times, graciously waving her tail, 'My son, when you find a Hedgehog you must drop him {{into the water and}} then he will uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must scoop him out of his shell with your paw.' And so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Best Beloved.|$|E
60|$|PICKERING [indulgently, being rather bored] Oh, <b>that</b> will <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Mrs. Higgins. [He {{rises to}} go].|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] he said, [...] "any {{man that}} has a {{nickname}} like <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>That's</b> the best recommendation you can give the General--just say 'Uncle Billy.'" [...] He put one lip over the other. [...] "You've given 'Uncle Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," [...] he said. [...] "Did you ever hear the story of Mr. Wallace's Irish gardener?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my boy, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Margaret and I {{have been}} talking, and I know her wishes." [...] He {{held out his}} hand. When I wrung it, and had kissed Margaret, who drew her chair close to mine, {{so that we could}} hold hands as we listened, he went on, but with a certain hesitation--it could hardly be called nervousness--which was new to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] said the Baroness, {{promptly}} veering round in defence of her offspring. [...] "Elsa said something quite clever on Thursday about the Triple Alliance. Something {{about it being}} like a paper umbrella, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> {{as long as you}} didn't take it out in the rain. It's not every one who could say that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jocularly I {{suggested}} the beastly heat {{as the first}} cause. But Captain Giles disclosed himself possessed of a deeper philosophy. Things out East were made easy for white men. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> The difficulty was to go on keeping white, {{and some of these}} nice boys did not know how. He gave me a searching look, and in a benevolent, heavy-uncle manner asked point blank: ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as I {{got started}} I took {{out after the}} raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> {{as far as it}} went, but the towhead warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right!</b> It would <b>be</b> a bother {{taking it}} down, and I should {{not know what}} to do with it when I got to Lisbon; it would be a {{nuisance}} altogether, and I am glad to get rid of it. The money is of no consequence to me one way or the other. I wish you better luck with it than I have had." ...|$|R
5000|$|For years I have <b>been</b> pretending <b>that</b> {{everything}} <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> {{when in fact}} I hurt all the time...I cannot pretend anymore.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{almost always}} right, Gran'pa Jim," [...] she admitted; [...] "but {{in all our}} European travels I've not met so {{interesting}} a person as Alora, and she's an American girl, which draws us still closer together. I'm going to make her promise that when she's of age and her own mistress she will let me know, and come to us for a visit. Wouldn't <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Gran'pa?" ...|$|R
