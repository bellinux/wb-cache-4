25|$|In the 6th century Tiberias {{was still}} the seat of Jewish {{religious}} learning. In light of this, a letter of Syriac bishop Simeon of Beth Arsham urged the Christians of Palaestina to seize the leaders of Judaism in Tiberias, to put them to the rack, and to compel them to command the Jewish king, Dhu Nuwas, <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> persecuting the Christians in Najran.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{breakdown}} of international diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis, the fighting in the Six-Day War of 1967 began on 6 June 1967 with surprise Israeli air strikes that destroyed the entire Egyptian air force {{while it was still}} on the ground. In spite of Israel's request to Jordan <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> attacking it, Jordan along with Syria began to shell Israeli targets. In addition, Hussein, reluctant at first, sent ineffective bomber strikes because of Nasser's requests and affirmation of a sound Egyptian victory. Attacks on other Arab air forces took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts. A subsequent ground invasion into Egyptian territory led to Israel's conquest of the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. With the rapid and rather unexpected success on the Egyptian front, Israel decided to attack and successfully captured the West Bank from Jordan on June 7, and the Golan Heights from Syria on June 9.|$|E
25|$|Romanos III {{arrived at}} Antioch with a 20,000-strong army, {{composed}} mostly of mercenaries, on 20 July 1030, {{and sent a}} messenger to Nasr and Thimal demanding they cede Aleppo to him. Nasr rejected the demand, detained the envoy and sent his own diplomatic mission, led by his cousin Muqallid ibn Kamil, to persuade Romanos <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> attacking Aleppo. Nasr's envoys told Romanos that the Mirdasids had not given the Byzantines any pretext for war and maintained the Byzantine protectorate and alliance per the treaty of 969. They also related that they were prepared for war should Romanos continue his offensive against Aleppo. Nasr's envoys were detained and Romanos continued his march, setting up camp outside Azaz, to the northwest of Aleppo. Nasr and Thimal, meanwhile, evacuated their families from the city, and mobilized the Kilab, the Banu Numayr and other Bedouin tribes, {{as well as local}} Muslims from Aleppo and its hinterland. The bulk of the Mirdasid force remained with Thimal to defend Aleppo and its citadel, while Nasr and some 700–900 Bedouin horsemen left to confront the Byzantines.|$|E
25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it.

25|$|The {{incident}} {{that marked the}} turning point of Indo-LTTE relationship occurred in early October. On 4 October 1987, the Sri Lankan Navy captured an LTTE boat off Point Pedro with seventeen Tigers, including some high-profile leaders of the movement, on board. The Colombo govt alleged the boat was involved in smuggling arms across the Palk Straits and on the grounds denied immunity to these captured Tiger rebels. The LTTE denied this claiming the rebels movement {{were in accordance with}} the truce, being in the process of transferring documents for shifting the Tigers Headquarters from Madras to Jaffna. The Sinhalese government intended to bring a number of the rebels captured, including Pulendran, Kumarappa and others, to trial in Colombo for allegedly masterminding the massacre of a hundred and fifty civilians. The Tigers, who were at the time still in negotiation with the Indian authorities, appealed for enforcement of protection by the IPKF. The rebels were at this time in IPKF custody at Palali Airbase pending transfer to Sinhalese authorities. Although the Indian authorities insist that they had explained the possible repercussions of such an action on the fragile truce and exerted considerable pressure on the Sinhalese authorities <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> proceeding, ultimately the IPKF withdrew allowing the Sri Lankan forces to proceed with transferring the captured rebels to Colombo. The detainees however, attempted mass suicide by swallowing cyanide- a common LTTE practice when faced imminent capture. The night of 5 October saw large scale slaughter of Sinhalese people who had returned to Jaffna, including eight troops of the Sri Lankan Army who were at the time being held hostages by the LTTE. These coincided by armed confrontations between the Tiger Cadres and the Indian Troops in and around Jaffna. On 8 October, the LTTE carried out a number of mortar attacks and ambushes on the IPKF.|$|E
500|$|In July, the IWW {{called for}} a strike against all the mines in the district. In this case, the MMSW voted 470 to 194 against striking. Three days later, about 250 armed vigilantes rounded up at least 60 {{suspected}} IWW members, loaded them onto a railroad cattle car, and shipped them out of town {{in what has been}} called the Jerome Deportation. Nine IWW members, thought by the Prescott sheriff's department to be leaders, were arrested and jailed temporarily in Prescott though never charged with a crime; others were taken to Needles, California, then to Kingman, Arizona, where they were released after promising <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> [...] "further agitation".|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the studio}} bowed to {{pressure}} from the Roosevelt Administration, the Hays Office, and isolationist lawmakers <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> similar projects. Jack Warner announced that the studio would release no more [...] "propaganda pictures" [...] and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme. In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including Underground and All Through the Night. In 1940, the studio produced short films that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on London. Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the Royal Canadian Air Force, with films such as Captains of the Clouds. In 1941, Warner also produced the influential war film Sergeant York.|$|E

500|$|On August 5, the HMS Falcon, {{commanded}} by John Linzee, appeared off Ipswich Bay. Captain Linzee sent a barge {{of men to}} the shore in search of livestock, hove to, and sent a barge containing about 50 men ashore to secure a supply of mutton from, the flock of sheep grazing on the Coffin farm at West Gloucester. Major Coffin observed their movements and anticipated their design. He hastily gathered some half dozen men, armed them with rifles and, concealed behind sand mounds, kept up such a brisk firing that the sailors in the barge, supposing that a large company were ready to receive them, thought it prudent <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> their sheep foraging intentions {{and returned to the}} [...] "Falcon". When the barge returned to the Falcon, Linzee sent it to investigate a schooner in the harbor; this ship turned out to only contain ballast.

500|$|The U.S. State Department {{acknowledged}} that it had received reports of [...] "myriad deaths" [...] along the Albanian border. State Department spokesman James Rubin called the situation in Kosovo [...] "quite troubling, extremely dangerous."

In turn, the Yugoslav military issued a statement requesting that the West put pressure on Kosovo Albanian leaders [...] "to give up and denounce terrorism if they truly wanted a peaceful and political solution to Kosovo's problems." [...] The statement also accused Albania of [...] "training, infiltrating and illegally arming the terrorists," [...] and demanded that the West pressure the country <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> such activities. Albania denied supporting the KLA insurgency, and alleged that two Yugoslav helicopters had violated its airspace. Yugoslavia denied that there had been any violations. Consequently, the Albanian Army and police were placed on high alert, and the country stationed elite troops along its border.|$|E

500|$|The ensuing period {{became known}} as the [...] "Days of May", with so great a level of {{political}} agitation that some feared revolution. Some protesters advocated non-payment of taxes, and urged a run on the banks; one day signs appeared across London reading [...] "Stop the Duke; go for gold!" [...] £1.8 million was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the run (out of about £7 million total gold in the Bank's possession). The National Political Union and other organisations sent petitions to the House of Commons, demanding that they withhold supply (cut off funding to the government) until the House of Lords should acquiesce. Some demonstrations called for the abolition of the nobility, and some even of the monarchy. In these circumstances, the Duke of Wellington had great difficulty in building support for his premiership, despite promising moderate reform. He was unable to form a government, leaving King William with no choice but to recall Lord Grey. Eventually the king consented to fill the House of Lords with Whigs; however, without the knowledge of his cabinet, Wellington circulated a letter among Tory peers, encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> further opposition, and warning them of the consequences of continuing. At this, enough opposing peers relented. By abstaining from further votes, they allowed the legislation to pass in the House of Lords, and the Crown was thus not forced to create new peers. The bill finally received the Royal Assent on 7 June 1832, thereby becoming law.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, Syrian media {{reported}} Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told President Bashar al-Assad that Israel would {{withdraw from}} the Golan Heights in return for peace. Israeli leaders of communities in the Golan Heights held a special meeting and stated: [...] "all construction and development projects in the Golan are going ahead as planned, propelled by the certainty that any attempt to harm Israeli sovereignty in the Golan will cause severe damage to state security and thus is doomed to fail". A survey found that 70% of Israelis oppose relinquishing the Golan for peace with Syria. That year, a plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution 161–1 in favour of a motion on the Golan Heights that reaffirmed Security Council resolution 497 and called on Israel <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> [...] "changing the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan and, in particular, <b>to</b> <b>desist</b> <b>from</b> the establishment of settlements [...] from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan and from its repressive measures against {{the population of the}} occupied Syrian Golan."
