40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> in a regime of {{widespread}} fiscal corruption in a static framework. We prove {{that the relationship between}} the tax rate and <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> depends on the relevance of the "shame effect" of being detected in a corrupt transaction. In countries with a "low shame" effect, <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> grow as the tax rate increases. Moreover, there is a critical tax rate where the growth rate of <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> begins to reduce.

40|$|State {{and local}} {{government}} <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> dropped steeply following the most severe housing market contraction since the Great Depression. We identify five main channels through which the housing market affects state and local tax revenues: property <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> transfer <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> personal income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> direct sales <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> (through construction materials) and indirect sales <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> (through the link between housing wealth and consumption). We find that historically property <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> do not tend to decrease following house price declines. Similarly, property tax collections have yet to fall on average during the current housing market contraction. On the basis of state-level case studies we conclude that the current resilience of property tax receipts is due to significant lags between market and assessed values and the tendency of policy makers offset declines in the tax base with higher tax rates. The other four channels have had a relatively modest effect on state <b>tax</b> <b>revenues.</b> We calculate that the combined channels reduced <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> by $ 14 billion from 2005 to 2009, which is less than 2 percent of total state own-source revenues in 2005. We conclude that the recent contraction {{in state and local}} <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> has been driven primarily by the general economic recession, rather than the housing market per-se. I...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates why {{countries}} mandate accruals in {{the definition}} of corporate taxable income. Accruals alleviate timing and matching problems in cash flows, which smoothes taxable income and thus better aligns it with underlying economic performance. These accrual properties can be desirable in the tax setting as tax authorities seek more predictable corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues.</b> However, they can also make <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> procyclical by increasing the correlation between aggregate corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> and aggregate economic activity. We argue that accruals shape the distribution of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> which leads regulators to incorporate accruals into the definition of taxable income to balance the portfolio of government revenues and expenditures. Using a sample of 26 OECD countries, we find support for several theoretically motivated factors explaining the use of accruals in tax codes. We first provide evidence that corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> are less volatile in high accrual countries, but high accrual countries collect relatively higher (lower) <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> when the corporate sector grows (contracts). Critically, we then show that accruals and smoother <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> are favored by countries with higher levels of government spending on public services and uncertain future expenditures, while countries with procyclical other tax collections favor cash rules and lower procyclicality of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>revenues...</b>|$|R

Since the late 1980s, the economy of Marysville has centered around retail areas, including the downtown Marysville Towne Center Mall (opened in 1987) and the Naval Support Complex (opened in 1995). The Tulalip Tribes built a new casino and new shopping center in the early 2000s to the west of Marysville, contributing to a fall in sales <b>tax</b> <b>revenue.</b> In the latter half of the decade, Marysville opened two large retail centers of its own in the annexed Lakewood neighborhood and at 116th Street NE, bringing additional jobs and sales <b>tax</b> <b>revenue</b> to the city.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Indonesian's income tax reforms and the {{development}} of Indonesian's income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> in the period of 1983 - 2011. It points out two key features of the Indonesian's income tax reforms: 1) the tax reforms have embraced tax rates cutting and tax bases broadening apcomprehensive income tax system toward the schedular tax system. Then, regarding <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> data shows that the Indonesian's nominal income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> have increased considerably during that period; however they {{have not been able to}} increase Indonesian's income tax ratios significantly. This phenomenon indicates that even though the income tax reforms did have positive effects on increasing the income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues,</b> they were not the only factors for the steep increase of Indonesian's nominal income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues.</b> This paper shows that Indonesian's relatively high inflation rates and high economic growth during that period have considerably contributed to the steep increases of income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues.</b> At the end, in order to increase the Indonesian's income <b>tax</b> <b>revenues</b> fur- ther, this paper notes that beside tax regulation reform, it is equally necessary to promote public tax awareness, tax authorities' professionalism and integrity, and the implementation of governance practices in Indonesian's bureaucracy...|$|R
