40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{carding machine}} using gill pin <b>taker-in</b> on {{polyester}} yarn hairiness was studied. The hairiness of the yarn processed by carding machine with gill pin <b>taker-in</b> and saw-tooth <b>taker-in</b> respectively, which using three-grade speed was tested by YG 172 Yarn Hairiness Tester. The {{results show that}} (1) when using gill pin <b>taker-in,</b> it is most advantageous to the reduction of hairiness of 2 mm and above when the <b>taker-in</b> speed is 1290 r/min, while it is most advantageous to the reduction of hairiness of 3 mm and above when the <b>taker-in</b> speed is 820 r/min; (2) when using saw-tooth <b>taker-in,</b> it is most advantageous to the reduction of yarn hairiness when the <b>taker-in</b> speed is 1290 r/min; (3) the hairiness of the yarn processed by gill pin <b>taker-in</b> is more than that processed by saw-tooth <b>taker-in</b> as a whole...|$|E

This paper gives a {{model of}} using CFD to {{calculate}} the airflow between <b>taker-in</b> and its casing in the A 186 carding machine for researching static pressure of the airflow with FLUENT software. The model analyzes the static pressure in the casing of <b>taker-in</b> under {{the condition of the}} different rotation speeds of <b>taker-in</b> and cylinder and two gauges in air inlet of the casing. The numerical calculation of the model shows that the rotation speed of <b>taker-in</b> and cylinder has an obvious influence on the static pressure of the casing, of which the effect of rotation speed of <b>taker-in</b> is larger than that of cylinder, and the static pressure increases gradually from air inlet to outlet between <b>taker-in</b> and its casing. Furthermore, the calculation results confirm that while the gauge of the air inlet diminish, the static pressure of the air inlet decreases but that of the air outlet has little change. The calculation result of the model has a good agreement with the conclusion of previous study with the experimental method...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{understanding}} the transfer of fibres between carding-machine surfaces is addressed by considering the movement of a single fibre in an airflow. The structure of the aerodynamic flow field predicts how and when fibres migrate between the different process surfaces. In {{the case of a}} revolving-flats carding machine the theory predicts a “strong” aerodynamic mechanism between <b>taker-in</b> and cylinder and a “weak” mechanism between cylinder and removal cylinder resulting in effective transfer in the first case and a more limited transfer in the second...|$|E
40|$|Carding is an {{essential}} pre-spinning process whereby masses of dirty tufted fibres are cleaned, disentangled and refined into a smooth coherent web. Research and development in this `low-technology' industry have hitherto depended on empirical evidence. In collaboration with the School of Textile Industries at the University of Leeds, a mathematical theory has been developed that describes the passage of fibres through the carding machine. The fibre dynamics in the carding machine are posed, modelled and simulated by three distinct physical problems: the journey of a single fibre, the extraction of fibres from a tuft or tufts and many interconnecting, entangled fibres. A description {{of the life of}} a single fibre is given as it is transported through the carding machine. Many fibres are sparsely distributed across machine surfaces, therefore interactions with other neighbouring fibres, either hydrodynamically or by frictional contact points, can be neglected. The aerodynamic forces overwhelm the fibre's ability to retain its crimp or natural curvature, and so the fibre is treated as an inextensible string. Two machine topologies are studied in detail, thin annular regions with hooked surfaces and the nip region between two rotating drums. The theoretical simulations suggest that fibres do not transfer between carding surfaces in annular machine geometries. In contrast to current carding theories, which are speculative, a novel explanation is developed for fibre transfer between the rotating drums. The mathematical simulations describe two distinct mechanisms: strong transferral forces between the <b>taker-in</b> and cylinder and a weaker mechanism between cylinder and doffer. Most fibres enter the carding machine connected to and entangled with other fibres. Fibres are teased from their neighbours and in the case where their neighbours form a tuft, which is a cohesive and resistive fibre structure, a model has been developed to understand how a tuft is opened and broken down during the carding process. Hook-fibre-tuft competitions are modelled in detail: a single fibre extracted from a tuft by a hook and diverging hook-entrained tufts with many interconnecting fibres. Consequently, for each scenario once fibres have been completely or partially extracted, estimates can be made as to {{the degree to which a}} tuft has been opened-up. Finally, a continuum approach is used to simulate many interconnected, entangled fibre-tuft populations, focusing in particular on their deformations. A novel approach describes this medium by density, velocity, directionality, alignment and entanglement. The materials responds to stress as an isotropic or transversely isotropic medium dependent on the degree of alignment. Additionally, the material's response to stress is a function of the degree of entanglement which we describe by using braid theory. Analytical solutions are found for elongational and shearing flows, and these compare very well with experiments for certain parameter regimes...|$|E
