50|$|A {{clinometer}} or inclinometer is {{an instrument}} for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or depression of an object with respect to gravity. It {{is also known as}} a <b>tilt</b> <b>meter,</b> tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope)#Nomenclature for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.|$|E
50|$|The UNAVCO GAGE Facility {{provides}} {{access to}} several types of data that scientists use for quantifying the motions of rock, ice and water {{at or near the}} Earth’s surface. Geodetic GPS/GNSS Data (Global Navigation Satellite System / Global Positioning System Data), enable millimeter-scale surface motion measurements at discrete points. Geodetic Imaging Data are collected by a variety of different sensors deployed on satellites, aircraft, and on the ground, and provide high resolution terrain models and deformation measurements over areas of tens of meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Data collected from Strain and Seismic Borehole instruments measure the deformation at or near the surface of the Earth and measure rock physical properties {{in the vicinity of the}} installations. At many of the sites where geodetic measurements are made, Meteorological Data are also collected to aid in the processing of the geodetic data. Under the large EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, UNAVCO acquires, archives, and/or distributes a number of community data sets including GPS, strainmeter, borehole seismometer, <b>tilt</b> <b>meter,</b> and geodetic imaging with radar and lidar, as part of EarthScope’s Plate Boundary Observatory.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tilt</b> current <b>meters</b> {{operate under}} the drag-tilt {{principle}} and are designed to either float or sink depending on the type. A floating <b>tilt</b> current <b>meter</b> typically consists of a sub-surface buoyant housing that is anchored to the sea floor with a flexible line or tether. A sinking tilt current is similar, but the housing is designed such that the meter hangs from the attachment point. In either case, the housing tilts {{as a function of}} its shape, buoyancy (negative or positive) and the water velocity. Once the characteristics of a housing is known, the velocity can be determined by measuring the angle of the housing and direction of tilt. The housing contains a data logger that records the orientation (angle from vertical and compass bearing) of the <b>Tilt</b> Current <b>Meter.</b> Floating <b>tilt</b> current <b>meters</b> are typically deployed on the bottom with a lead or concrete anchor but may be deployed on lobster traps or other convenient anchors of opportunity.

40|$|Digital {{zenith camera}} systems (DZCS) are {{dedicated}} astronomical-geodetic measurement {{systems for the}} observation of {{the direction of the}} plumb line. A DZCS key component is a pair of <b>tilt</b> <b>meters</b> for the determination of the instrumental tilt with respect to the plumb line. Highest accuracy (i. e., 0. 1 [*]arc-seconds or better) is achieved in practice through observation with precision <b>tilt</b> <b>meters</b> in opposite faces (180 ° instrumental rotation), and application of rigorous tilt reduction models. A novel concept proposes the development of a hexapod (Stewart platform) -based DZCS. However, hexapod-based total rotations are limited to about 30 °– 60 ° in azimuth (equivalent to ± 15 ° to ± 30 ° yaw rotation), which raises the question {{of the impact of the}} rotation angle between the two faces on the accuracy of the tilt measurement. The goal of the present study is the investigation of the expected accuracy of tilt measurements to be carried out on future hexapod-based DZCS, with special focus placed on the role of the limited rotation angle. A Monte-Carlo simulation study is carried out in order to derive accuracy estimates for the tilt determination as a function of several input parameters, and the results are validated against analytical error propagation. As the main result of the study, limitation of the instrumental rotation to 60 ° (30 °) deteriorates the tilt accuracy by a factor of about 2 (4) compared to a 180 ° rotation between the faces. Nonetheless, a tilt accuracy at the 0. 1 [*]arc-second level is expected when the rotation is at least 45 °, and 0. 05 arc-second (about 0. 25 microradian) accurate <b>tilt</b> <b>meters</b> are deployed. As such, a hexapod-based DZCS can be expected to allow sufficiently accurate determination of the instrumental tilt. This provides supporting evidence for the feasibility of such a novel instrumentation. The outcomes of our study are not only relevant to the field of DZCS, but also to all other types of instruments where the instrumental tilt must be corrected. Examples include electronic theodolites or total stations, gravity meters, and other hexapod-based telescopes...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of precision {{and length of}} available time series of continuous GNSS observations reveals an increasing multitude of observed crustal deformation signals. The environmental induced signals are becoming more evident, as those due to thermoelastic deformation, due to subsurface water flows and loading tides and the tectonic signals as seismic fault movements and free oscillations.
