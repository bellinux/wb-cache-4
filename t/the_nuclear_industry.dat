5|$|The 10B isotope {{is useful}} for {{capturing}} thermal neutrons (see neutron cross section#Typical cross sections). <b>The</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry</b> enriches natural boron to nearly pure 10B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure 11B.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry,</b> the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} there are only a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry</b> for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry,</b> and the NRC. Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance {{both before and after}} the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Kennedy Martin {{had written}} {{the first draft of}} what would {{eventually}} become Edge of Darkness – at this stage it was called Magnox (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry.</b> The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development. The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Industry</b> Radioactive Waste Management Executive (NIREX) was {{established}} {{with responsibility for}} disposing of long-lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal 200–1,000 meters underground. NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site. A Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield reprocessing plant.|$|E

5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry</b> – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|After he had {{completed}} his doctoral study, {{he was offered}} a job at EG Corporation Energy Measurements in Goleta, California, to work on crystal growth. EG was a defense contractor of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required Van den Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. Van den Berg gathered years of research and management experience {{in the preparation of}} crystalline materials—in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>industry</b> as gamma ray detectors. During his work at EG, Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space, which NASA approved.|$|E
