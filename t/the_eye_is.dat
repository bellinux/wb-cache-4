5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|The cloudy {{outer edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> called the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is {{sometimes referred to as}} the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to <b>be</b> expressive, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> portrayed in Maitum jars are given high regard in describing <b>the</b> dead. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> classified to four major shapes: (1) Almond, (2) Ovaloid, (3) Round, and (4) Rectangular.|$|R
5000|$|For Series 13 <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> exactly <b>the</b> {{same shape}} and size as the {{previous}} series. The centre of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> a 3D purple sphere that had a white glowing pupil. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> separated into multi-coloured sections that would rotate and spin during the title sequence, {{at the beginning and}} end and also when the day and time was being announced by narrator Marcus Bentley.|$|R
50|$|Females have an unpatterned prosoma with {{a reddish}} yellow sternum and appendages. The prosoma length <b>is</b> 2.3 mm. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> ringed brown. <b>The</b> opisthosoma is unpatterned.Males have a prosoma length of 2.2 mm. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> ringed blackish brown.|$|R
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near <b>the</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>is</b> called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E
5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of <b>the</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>is</b> also more common in those with HIV.|$|E

40|$|A Drowsy Driver Detection System is an Image {{processing}} based system. This {{system is}} developed using a non-intrusive machine vision based concepts. In this system, {{there is a}} camera that will be continuously monitoring the driver’s face to detect fatigue. In case the driver is detected as fatigue, the system issues an alarm. This system detects drowsiness by checking {{the amount of time}} <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed. <b>The</b> first five consecutive frames of the camera <b>is</b> checked, if <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> found closed in all the five frames, then the system issues alarm. Before determining whether <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open or closed, it is required to determine eye location. To determine <b>eye</b> location, <b>the</b> images captured from the camera are binarized. This binary version of the image help to find the edges of the face, which narrows the area of where <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> may exist. Once the face area <b>is</b> found, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> found by computing the horizontal averages in the area. Based on intensity change <b>eye</b> location <b>is</b> found, as <b>eye</b> regions in <b>the</b> face present great intensity changes. Once <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> located, measuring <b>the</b> distances between the intensity changes in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> area it <b>is</b> determined whether <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> open or closed. A large distance corresponds to eye closure...|$|R
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one <b>eye</b> affects <b>the</b> {{diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, <b>the</b> pupil of <b>the</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> pupil of <b>the</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, Corvidae, though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers {{have a tendency to}} bleach to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by a band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} an unusual shape for a crocodilian, with a {{dome-shaped}} skull {{and a short}} smooth, concave snout with an upturned tip, the shape rather resembling {{the head of a}} dog. The upper jaw extends markedly further forward than the lower jaw. There are four pre-maxillary and fourteen to fifteen maxillary teeth {{on either side of the}} upper jaw and twenty-one or twenty-two teeth on each side of the lower jaw giving a total of about eighty teeth. The neck is relatively slender and the dorsal scutes are less prominent than in the smooth-fronted caiman (Paleosuchus trigonatus). The double row of scutes on the tail are small and project vertically. Adults are dark brownish-black with a dark brown head while juveniles are brown with black bands. The iris of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> chestnut brown at all ages and the pupil is a vertical slit.|$|E
5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are marked {{on the head and}} nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts. The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. The feathers of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{about the}} Eye, known from allusions in the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) {{and a more}} {{complete}} account in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus from the Late Period (664–332 BC), demonstrates the Eye's close connection with Ra and Atum and her ability to act independently. The myth takes place before {{the creation of the}} world, when the solar creator—either Ra or Atum—is alone. Shu and Tefnut, the children of this creator god, have drifted away from him in the waters of Nu, the chaos that exists before creation in Egyptian belief, so he sends out his Eye to find them. The Eye returns with Shu and Tefnut but is infuriated to see that the creator has developed a new eye, which has taken her place. The creator god appeases her by giving her an exalted position on his forehead {{in the form of the}} uraeus, the emblematic cobra that appears frequently in Egyptian art, particularly on royal crowns. The equation of the Eye with the uraeus and the crown underlines the Eye's role as a companion to Ra and to the pharaoh, with whom Ra is linked. Upon the return of Shu and Tefnut, the creator god is said to have shed tears, although whether they are prompted by happiness at his children's return or distress at the Eye's anger is unclear. These tears give rise to the first humans. In a variant of the story, it is the Eye that weeps instead, so <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> the progenitor of humankind.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies {{a loss of}} virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
5|$|The Eye of Ra or Eye of Re is a {{being in}} ancient Egyptian mythology that {{functions}} as a feminine counterpart to the sun god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> an extension of Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by {{a wide variety of}} Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. The Eye goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner in the creative cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of the Eye goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. The Eye of Ra is similar to the Eye of Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when the Eye goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is fairly}} large and {{distinct}} and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The {{edge of the}} snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the rostral scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large nasal scale. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital scales. The temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).|$|E
