The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the validity of the LSST by comparing the clinical measurements on the skin surface to the actual anatomical distance between the scapula and the spine as seen on radiographic images.

Nine subjects (18 shoulders) were assessed with the clinical LSST and radiographic images in three <b>test</b> <b>positions</b> (0 °, 45 °, and 90 ° of glenohumeral abduction).

5000|$|BESS. The BESS (Balance Error Scoring System) is a {{commonly}} used way to assess balance. It {{is known as}} a simple and affordable way to get an accurate assessment of balance, although the validity of the BESS protocol has been questioned. The BESS is often used in sports settings to assess the effects of mild to moderate head injury on one’s postural stability. The BESS tests three separate stances (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (firm surface and medium density foam) for a total of six tests. Each test is 20 seconds long, with the entire time of the assessment approximately 5-7 minutes. The first stance is the double leg stance. The participant is instructed to stand on a firm surface with feet side by side with hands on hips and eyes closed. The second stance is the single leg stance. In this stance the participant is instructed to stand on their non-dominant foot on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The third stance is the tandem stance. The participant stands heel to toe on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stances repeat in order stances one, two, and three except the participant performs these stances on a medium density foam surface. The BESS is scored by an examiner who looks for deviations from the proper stances. A deviation is noted when any of the following occurs in the participant during testing: opening the eyes, removing hands from the hips, stumbling forward or falling, lifting the forefoot or heel off the testing surface, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, or remaining out of the proper <b>testing</b> <b>position</b> for more than 5 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Background: Forward head is {{a common}} {{postural}} fault of the cervical spine that can be assessed using the photogrammetry method. This is a valid, popular and feasible clinical method. Although forward head is primarily a sagittal plane postural fault, deviations in other planes may result in measurement errors when photos are captured from only one side. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether forward head assessment by photogrammetry taken from the right (Rt) or left (Lt) sides of the body would differ. Methods: One hundred thirty two healthy adults were assessed from standing and 90 were assessed from sitting positions. In addition, 41 patients with mechanical neck pain were assessed from standing and 56 from sitting positions. Three profile photos were captured from each side in standing and sitting positions. Photos were then digitized before they were analyzed using the kinovea software to measure the craniovertebral (CVA) and gaze angles. Results: In healthy adults, the CVA was not significantly different across sides (p> 0. 05) whereas the gaze angle was different regardless of the <b>testing</b> <b>position</b> (p 0. 05), whereas the gaze angle did not differ regardless of the <b>testing</b> <b>position</b> (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Numerous {{methods have}} been {{developed}} {{over the last decade}} to predict allelic identity at unobserved loci between pairs of chromosome segments along the genome. These loci are often unobserved <b>positions</b> <b>tested</b> for the presence of quantitative trait loci (QTL). The main objective {{of this study was to}} understand from a theoretical standpoint the relation between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allelic identity prediction when using haplotypes for fine mapping of QTL. In addition, six allelic identity predictors (AIP) were also compared in this study to determine which one performed best in theory and application. A criterion based on a simple measure of matrix distance was used to study the relation between LD and allelic identity prediction when using haplotypes. The consistency of this criterion with the accuracy of QTL localization, another criterion commonly used to compare AIP, was evaluated on a set of real chromosomes. For this set of chromosomes, the criterion was consistent with the mapping accuracy of a simulated QTL with either low or high effect. As measured by the matrix distance, the best AIP for QTL mapping were those that best captured LD between a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and a QTL. Moreover the matrix distance between a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and a QTL was shown to decrease for some AIP when LD increased. However, the matrix distance for AIP with continuous predictions in the [0, 1] interval was algebraically proven to decrease less rapidly up to a lower bound with increasing LD in the simplest situations, than the discrete predictor based on identity by state between haplotypes (IBS hap), for which there was no lower bound. The expected LD between haplotypes at a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and alleles at a QTL is a quantity that increases naturally when the <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> gets closer to the QTL. This behavior was demonstrated with pig and unrelated human chromosomes. When the density of markers is high, and therefore LD between adjacent loci can be assumed to be high, the discrete predictor IBS hap is recommended since it predicts allele identity correctly when taking LD into account...|$|R

Although some authors, in the literature regarding the rotation stress test, accept that rotation will occur during testing, estimates of range occurring with a normal test response vary between 20 and 40 degrees.

Objective: The {{purposes of this study}} were: (1) to examine the range of craniocervical rotation occurring during rotation stress testing for the alar ligaments in individuals who are healthy and (2) to investigate a measurement protocol for quantifying rotation. Design: A within-subject experimental study was conducted. Methods: Sixteen participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging in neutral and end-range rotation stress <b>test</b> <b>positions.</b> Measurements followed a standardized protocol relative to the position of the axis. A line connecting the transverse foramena of the axis created a reference plane. The position of the occiput in the head-neutral position was calculated as the angle formed between a line joining the foramena lacerum and the reference plane. Measurements were repeated at the end-range <b>test</b> <b>position.</b> Total rotation of the occiput was calculated as the difference in angles measured in neutral and <b>test</b> <b>positions.</b> Measurement was performed on 4 occasions, and reliability of measurements was assessed using the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Measurement of rotation of the occiput relative to a stabilized axis ranged between 1. 7 and 21. 5 degrees (X̅= 10. 6, SD= 5. 1, SEM= 1. 14, ICC=. 96, 95 % confidence interval=. 90 –. 98).

For this set of chromosomes, the criterion was consistent with the mapping accuracy of a simulated QTL with either low or high effect. As measured by the matrix distance, the best AIP for QTL mapping were those that best captured LD between a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and a QTL. Moreover the matrix distance between a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and a QTL was shown to decrease for some AIP when LD increased. However, the matrix distance for AIP with continuous predictions in the [0, 1] interval was algebraically proven to decrease less rapidly up to a lower bound with increasing LD in the simplest situations, than the discrete predictor based on identity by state between haplotypes (IBS hap), for which there was no lower bound. The expected LD between haplotypes at a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and alleles at a QTL is a quantity that increases naturally when the <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> gets closer to the QTL. This behavior was demonstrated with pig and unrelated human chromosomes. ConclusionsWhen the density of markers is high, and therefore LD between adjacent loci can be assumed to be high, the discrete predictor IBS hap is recommended since it predicts allele identity correctly when taking LD into account...|$|R
