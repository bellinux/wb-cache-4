25|$|The {{coast of}} Hudson Bay is {{extremely}} sparsely populated; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> a dozen communities. Some {{of these were}} founded as trading posts in the 17th and 18th centuries by the Hudson's Bay Company, making them some of the oldest settlements in Western Canada. With {{the closure of the}} HBC posts and stores, although many are now run by The North West Company, {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, many coastal villages are now almost exclusively populated by Cree and Inuit people. Two main historic sites along the coast were York Factory and Prince of Wales Fort.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} 1970s, the {{government}} changed its policies {{in regards to}} the Lacandon, establishing the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. It evicted some squatters, and granted the tiny group of Lacandones ownership of huge tracts in the reserve. That caused resentment in some indigenous communities, and would be a factor in the Zapatista uprising two decades later. However, even with the establishment of the reserve, the government did not sufficiently protect it, and many squatters made their way onto the lands, creating patchworks of squatter camps. Even today, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> twenty forest rangers for the entire reserve.|$|E

500|$|Istanbul's {{persistently}} high humidity reaches [...] most mornings. Because of this, fog is very common, {{although more}} so in northern {{parts of the city}} and away from the city center. Dense fog disrupts transportation in the region, including on the Bosphorus, and is common during the autumn and winter months when the humidity remains high into the afternoon. The humid conditions and the fog tend to dissipate by midday during the summer months, but the lingering humidity exacerbates the moderately high summer temperatures. During these summer months, high temperatures average around [...] and rainfall is uncommon; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> fifteen days with measurable precipitation between June and August.

500|$|There {{are only}} three living genera in the family Marsileaceae. [...] The {{majority}} of species (about 45 to 70) belong to the genus Marsilea, which grows worldwide in warm-temperate and tropical regions. [...] Marsilea can be distinguished from the other two genera {{by the presence of}} four leaflets on each leaf, although some species occasionally produce six leaflets per leaf. A second genus Regnellidium includes a single living species that grows only in southern Brazil and neighboring parts of Argentina; it has only two leaflets per leaf. [...] The third genus Pilularia grows widely in temperate regions of both the northern and southern hemispheres. [...] Its leaves do not subdivide into leaflets but are slender and tapered to a point, so that it is often overlooked and mistaken for a grass. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> five species known.|$|E
500|$|Population of free-ranging horses is {{a concern}} because, unlike {{wildlife}} or livestock, horses are not hunted, do not face significant natural predators, nor are their numbers human-controlled by means of grazing permits. [...] Without population control, their numbers can double every four years. With current management practices, numbers currently are increasing by about 15% to 18% each year. [...] , 48,447 equines that had been captured, removed from the range were kept in holding facilities in various locations throughout the west and midwest. Many of these excess animals are eligible to be placed for [...] "adoption" [...] with private owners. [...] Since 1971, about 220,000 horses and burros have been adopted through the BLM. [...] In the early 2000s, about 8,000 horses a year were adopted, but at present, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 2,500 horses adopted each year. The BLM attributes this to changing economic conditions. Of those remaining in the wild, , the estimated 67,027 horses and burros are {{two and a half}} times the population in 1971 when the Act was passed and about twice the recommended AML. [...] Besides removal of about 3,500 animals in 2016 to long-term holding facilities and adoption, the BLM hopes to use fertility control and other tools to reduce numbers of horses on the range.|$|E

500|$|The Jutland horse (...) is a {{draft horse}} breed {{originating}} in Denmark, {{named after the}} Jutland Peninsula which forms {{the western part of}} the country. [...] Usually chestnut, they are a compact, muscular breed known for their calm and willing temperament. The breed was originally developed for use in agriculture, but today is more often seen in urban settings and at horse shows. Some of the best known members of the breed pull beer wagons for the Carlsberg brewery around Copenhagen, as well as at competitions and for demonstrations. Images from the 9th century show a horse similar to the Jutland being used by Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain. The first written record is from the 12th century, when they were popular as war horses. Some infusion of bloodlines from other breeds occurred in the 18th century, but the modern Jutland type only began about 1850 with the addition of blood from several other breeds, mainly draft horses. A stud book was created in the late 19th century, and the Jutland population grew to a maximum of around 15,000 by 1950. Numbers subsequently declined, and as of 2011 it is estimated that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 1,000 horses remaining.|$|E
