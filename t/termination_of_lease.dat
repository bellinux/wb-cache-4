40|$|Lease and {{ownership}} of non-residential premises Resumé The objective of my thesis {{is to describe}} in detail the current lease (sublease), {{and ownership}} of non-residential premises {{as well as their}} expected changes in the new Civil Code. Within my thesis I branch out into several chapters in which I try to provide a comprehensive view on the legal legislation of the concepts of a lease, sublease and ownership. I have analysed these terms and referred to the current as well as previous judgments where the legislation appears to be ambiguous, notably judgments delivered by the Supreme Court. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis, non- residential premises. Chapter Two is subdivided into parts which I dedicated to lease of non residential premises. This part of my work is devoted to a brief historical overview and current legislation of lease of non-residential premises most notably in view of selected parts of the Act No. 116 / 1990 Coll, and Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll. It provides an outline about creation of lease, particulars of the contract, rights and obligations of the lease and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease.</b> Act No. 116 / 1990 Coll. is significant as it restores the rights, which were removed during the period of socialism, of owners of non-residential premises to rent their property [...] . ...|$|E

The next chapter analyses the legal regulations <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> - the concept, the subject <b>of</b> the <b>lease,</b> the protection <b>of</b> the tenant and the rights and obligations follow from the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease.</b> The first way how rental can also be terminated is the expiry of the term, after that follows the renewal <b>of</b> the <b>lease,</b> with which the expiry of the period closely related. The fifth chapter deals with the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease,</b> which is the most extensively regulated in OZ and also is a frequent subject of lawsuits. Therefore I focus on the notice to quit in detail, in terms of both - the tenant and the landlord's perspective. While the death of the landlord does not affect the duration <b>of</b> the <b>lease,</b> the death <b>of</b> the tenant may terminate the lease, if there is no transfer <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> and if tenant's heir is not known within six months of the tenant's death (§ 2284 Civil Code).

40|$|The present Iowa laws {{pertaining}} to landlord-tenant relationships do {{not distinguish between}} urban and agricultural conditions, with only two exceptions: The agricultural landlord’s lien and the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> indefinite agricultural <b>leases.</b> This lien applies to the total crop and to all personal property of the tenant, except to the property exempted from execution. In addition, leases usually contain a provision in which the tenant waives his exemption rights. In periods of excessive price decline or crop failure, and if production credit is sought by the tenant, the landlord’s lien may work serious hardship. As a possible corrective, placing of certain limitations on the landlord’s lien, and declaring invalid any waivers of exemption rights might be considered. An Iowa statute provides that any lease with a fixed date <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> shall expire without notice and that only 1 month’s notice is necessary to terminate an indefinite tenancy. The old common law rule provided for a 6 months’ period <b>of</b> notice for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>leases</b> without a definite expiration date.

40|$|The legal reasons <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> residental <b>lease</b> - {{current and}} future {{legislation}} The thesis is composed of five separate chapters and a comparison table as an annex. The paper analyzes the different reasons for the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> flat according to currently active legislation and the legislation that comes into force on January 1, 2014. The author chose this topic because the issue of housing and residential <b>lease</b> affects all <b>of</b> us and it is thus important to recognize the exact content of individual reasons for termination. Given that a radical change awaits us in this field, the author decided to compare and evaluate the future legislation. The first chapter outlines a historical development {{of the reasons for}} termination in our modern democratic history. Primarily, it focuses on the changes that have been brought upon the termination reasons by the Act No. 107 / 2006 Coll. and 132 / 2011 Coll. To maintain a better consistency of the paper, the second chapter examines the basic terminology and assess where and how they are regulated today and how they will be in a few months time.
