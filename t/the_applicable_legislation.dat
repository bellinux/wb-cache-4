5000|$|Pharmacovigilance (PV or PhV), {{also known}} as drug safety, is the {{pharmacological}} science relating to the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of adverse effects with pharmaceutical products. [...] The etymological roots for the word [...] "pharmacovigilance" [...] are: pharmakon (Greek for drug) and vigilare (Latin for to keep watch). As such, pharmacovigilance heavily focuses on adverse drug reactions, or ADRs, which are defined as any response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, including lack of efficacy (the condition that this definition only applies with the doses normally used for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiological disorder function was excluded with the latest amendment of <b>the</b> <b>applicable</b> <b>legislation).</b> Medication errors such as overdose, and misuse and abuse of a drug as well as drug exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding, are also of interest, even without an adverse event, because they may result in an adverse drug reaction.|$|E
5000|$|In Catalonia, {{a unitary}} {{linguistic}} {{model has been}} formed with Catalan as the main vehicular language known as a [...] "conjunction model", based {{on the notion that}} [...] "everybody has the right to education in Catalan" [...] and this language [...] "must normally be used as vehicular language, and for university and non-university learning and teaching", as stated in article 35 of the Catalonia Statute of Autonomy of 2006. The conjunction model aims to prevent school segregation on linguistic grounds, even though it recognises the right to receive primary education in Catalan and Castilian and recognises the right of pupils joining the Catalan school system later to receive linguistic support if Catalan is not their first language. This model of course requires the teachers to be able to express themselves in either of Catalonia’s two official languages. In order to guarantee this point, in 1991 a law was approved governing access to the education sector, requiring teachers to have a level of Catalan and Castilian allowing them to perform their professional duties in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>applicable</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E

Specifically, item #34 of the enumerated list of war crimes under the NEI legislation was [...] "indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorising the population, whether described as taking hostages or not". The court understood the definition of such unlawful mass arrests to be as [...] "arrests of groups of persons firstly on the ground of wild rumours and suppositions, and secondly without definite facts and indications being present with regard to each person which would justify his arrest". To this it added commentary on indiscriminate mass arrests that are for the purpose of terrorizing the populace, stating that they [...] "contained the elements of systematic terrorism for nobody, even the most innocent, was any longer certain of his liberty, and a person once arrested, even if absolutely innocent, could no longer be sure of health and life".|$|E

50|$|Transparency {{of media}} {{ownership}} {{refers to the}} public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In Romania transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if Romania is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should {{be said that the}} focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership. Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted <b>the</b> <b>applicable</b> <b>legislation</b> which is indeed absent. The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the Trade Register Company. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.|$|E
