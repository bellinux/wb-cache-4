The winning caller in the competition was actually a visitor to the set who pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calling</b> from an outside line to select a prize. The competition was rigged because of a technical problem with receiving the calls.

Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E
25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his “Epigram on the Court Pucell,” which many critics call a “disturbingly ‘personal’ {{attack on a}} woman.” Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he had not wanted to happen. Regarding the title of the poem, “pucell” was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calling</b> Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a “generic court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.” Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonson’s frustration with having to rely on a woman, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent “inversion of traditional gender codes,” so he used the “trope of prostitution” in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E

2500|$|Seurat's Bathers preceded A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, {{which shows}} {{people on the}} bank of the other side of the river. While the bathers at Asnieres on the left bank are working-class people, it is the bourgeoisie who are on the right bank. The bathers are cast in light, while on the Grande Jatte almost {{everyone}} is in shadows, and there are allusions to lust (a woman with a monkey on a leash) and prostitution (a woman [...] "fishing"). Seurat's message has been interpreted as implying that the working class represented the future, while the middle classes had grown decrepit and ridden with vice. Seen in this light and context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asnières appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calling</b> out to them, as if to say [...] "we are the future, come and join us".|$|E
