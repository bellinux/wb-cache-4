50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the W251 model series {{followed an}} evolutionary {{path from the}} venerable W191 (ranging from 15MW to around 18MW over product life, with more than 180 units sold) and was introduced in 1967, {{just prior to the}} W501. The W251A, at a nominal rating of 20MW, was the first to feature cooling of first-stage <b>turbine</b> <b>vane</b> and other stationary parts. In 1985, when the W251B10 was rated at approximately 45MW, the W251 product line charter was moved to Westinghouse Canada. The W251, at half the rating of the W501, was popular for smaller applications, and about 230 units were sold. The final design before being dropped from the product line ca. 1998, the W251B12 was a 50MW class gas turbine, built at Westinghouse Hamilton, Ont. plant. With gear driven generator, the W251 could be used in 50 Hz as well as 60 Hz applications.|$|E

The results indicate that free-stream turbulence tends to induce streaks within the near wall flow, which augment the surface heat transfer. Turbulent breakdown is observed over the late suction surface, and this occurs via the growth of two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz spanwise roll-ups, which then develop into lambda vortices creating large local peaks in the surface heat transfer. Turbulent dissipation is found to significantly increase losses within the trailing-edge region of the vane...|$|E
