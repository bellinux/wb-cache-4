40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to seek first year students’ <b>engagement</b> at <b>the</b> universities. The methodology {{of this research was}} survey and correlation. The First Year Experience Questionnaire (FYEQ) of Krause & Coates (2008) employed to gather data. Of the 1921 first year students (girls 1136 and boys 785) 551 samples (girls 313 and boys 238) were elected to questionnaire by the targeted first year students at the University of Sistan and Baluchestan in Iran. SPSS 15 was used to produce Mean; Standard Deviations; Pearson Product Moment Correlation (r); T-test; and ANOVA. The results showed that the first year students relatively scored over average their engagements in five components, and they marked relatively high scores on intellectual engagement and class <b>engagement.</b> <b>The</b> rank order showed that intellectual engagement and class engagement have had outrank in comparison with other components. There was relatively high positive correlation between components of <b>engagement.</b> <b>The</b> highest correlation is related to <b>the</b> online <b>engagement</b> scale with <b>the</b> intellectual <b>engagement,</b> <b>the</b> transition <b>engagement</b> with <b>the</b> student-staff <b>engagement,</b> peer <b>engagement</b> scale with <b>the</b> academic <b>engagement,</b> and <b>the</b> beyond-class <b>engagement</b> scale with <b>the</b> online <b>engagement...</b>|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Sterett had the American colors raised, {{he had his}} men {{open fire}} upon the Tripolitans at close range with muskets. In response, Tripoli {{returned}} fire with an ineffective broadside. The Americans returned fire with their own broadsides, which led Rous to break off <b>the</b> <b>engagement</b> and attempt to flee. Neither able to fight off the American vessel nor outrun her, the Tripolitans attempted to grapple Enterprise and board her. Once within musket range, Enterprise marines opened fire on the Tripoli, foiling its boarding attempt, and forced Tripoli to try to break away once more. Enterprise continued <b>the</b> <b>engagement,</b> firing more broadsides into the Tripolitan and blasting a hole in her hull.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 3 July 1810 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, in which a French frigate squadron under Guy-Victor Duperré attacked and defeated a convoy of Honourable East India Company East Indiamen near the Comoros Islands. During <b>the</b> <b>engagement</b> the British convoy resisted strongly and suffered heavy casualties but two ships were eventually forced to surrender. These were the British flagship, the Windham, which held off the French squadron to allow the surviving ship Astell to escape, and the Ceylon. <b>The</b> <b>engagement</b> was the third successful French attack on an Indian Ocean convoy in just over a year, the French frigates {{being part of a}} squadron operating from the Île de France under Commodore Jacques Hamelin.|$|E
5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in <b>the</b> <b>engagement.</b> This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout <b>the</b> <b>engagement.</b> This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the data processing problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} the House of Lancaster was {{severely}} reduced after this battle. Henry fled the country, {{and many of his}} most powerful followers were dead or in exile after <b>the</b> <b>engagement,</b> letting Edward rule England uninterrupted for nineyears, before a brief restoration of Henry to the throne. Later generations remembered the battle as depicted in William Shakespeare's dramatic adaptation of Henry's life—Henry VI, Part 3, Act2, Scene5. In 1929, the Towton Cross was erected on the battlefield to commemorate the event.

5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>engagement,</b> Linois was the subject of criticism from the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests {{to make use of the}} Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at Port Louis, which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about <b>the</b> <b>engagement</b> with the China Fleet and when Decaen found his answers unsatisfactory the governor wrote a scathing letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next two and a half months, eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and Sémillante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
