5|$|At 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work {{supervisor}} of the nursing school faculty {{that she would be}} out of town for a week due to a death in her family; no one in her family had died. She also said she would contact them when she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
25|$|Two {{documentary}} {{films are}} known to have been made in north-eastern Portugal where present day descendants of marranos were interviewed about their lives. In 1974 for The Marranos of Portugal, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) sent reporter Ron Ben-Yishai to carry out interviews with families about their religious practice. After being asked to prove he knew Hebrew before <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk,</b> he found people still reluctant to talk openly but did eventually gain a remarkable insight into their version of Jewish customs, prayers and songs. The film was commended at the 1976 Jerusalem Jewish Film and TV Festival. Another documentary, The Last Marranos, was made by the New York Jewish Media Fund in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|The Liberal Democrats {{said that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> first to {{whichever}} party won the most seats. They later campaigned {{on being a}} stabilising influence should either the Conservatives or Labour fall short of a majority, with the slogan [...] "We will bring a heart to a Conservative Government and a brain to a Labour one." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Austin let it go. If <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> about Cayman, she <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> about Betty, but she listened. After all, she {{had given}} them a lead.|$|R
60|$|Faith and Una {{looked at}} each other again. This was a matter for the Good-Conduct Club. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> it over with Mary.|$|R

2500|$|Neither Flatt nor Scruggs {{spoke to}} each other for the next ten years — until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to the bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt's voice was barely above a whisper, he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs {{answered}} yes, but told Flatt <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> when he was better. [...] Flatt said, [...] "It came as quite a surprise and made me feel good". But Lester Flatt never recovered, and died May 11, 1979. [...] Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said [...] "Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living".|$|E
2500|$|The album leaked into file-sharing {{websites}} {{around three}} {{weeks prior to}} its release, although Lane remarked [...] "the fact that people are even interested enough to {{want to talk about}} the record, or when it leaks to even make the effort to download the record" [...] was [...] "all that really matters". On September 15, the band made Daisy available to stream through Myspace. In promoting the album, as with previous album The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, the band were very selective over which publications <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to, largely avoiding the American media altogether. The band also made the decision not to make conventional music videos, as well as ultimately only releasing one song as a single after scrapping the planned [...] "Sink" [...] single. Some publications speculated that Daisy would be the band's final album, claims which the band repeatedly denied.|$|E
2500|$|In late October 2009, Clinton {{travelled}} to Pakistan, {{where she}} had staged a memorable visit in 1995 while First Lady. Her arrival was followed within hours by the 28 October 2009 Peshawar bombing; in response, Clinton said of those responsible, [...] "They know {{they are on the}} losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is." [...] In addition to meeting with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani, she also staged numerous public appearances. In those, she let students, talk show hosts, and tribal elders repeatedly complain about and criticize American foreign policy and American actions. Occasionally, she pushed back in a more blunt fashion than usual for diplomats, explicitly wondering why Pakistan had not been more successful in combating al Qaeda [...] "if they wanted to." [...] Member of Parliament and government spokesperson Farahnaz Ispahani said, [...] "In the past, when the Americans came, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to the generals and go home. Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile or not, has made a big impression – and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it means so much more." ...|$|E
60|$|Finding <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> with him, {{the crow}} {{flew back to}} his tree, where he sat sullenly perched upon a branch near his nest. And they were very glad {{to get rid of}} him so easily.|$|R
60|$|When {{the young}} folk were wi' them <b>they</b> <b>would</b> speak little, {{but when they}} had gone <b>they</b> <b>would</b> aye <b>talk</b> as if some waefu' trial ere aboot to fa' upon them, though I could never gather from their words {{what it was that}} they were afeared o'.|$|R

60|$|If lost hounds {{could speak}} when they cast up next day, after an {{unchecked}} night among the wild {{life of the}} dark, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> much as our destroyers do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad cess to them!" [...] Mike exclaimed, indignantly. [...] "If I had two {{or three}} of them, it's mighty little <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of execution, after I and me stick had had a few minutes' {{converse}} with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may laugh, Katharine, but I {{can tell}} you that if any of your friends saw us {{together}} at this time of night <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> about it, and I should find that very disagreeable. But why do you laugh?" ...|$|E
60|$|A mere nothing, the Club assured him. The {{blushing}} modesty of the Autolycus Club at {{hearing of}} their own good deeds was touching. Left to themselves, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked</b> of quite other things. As a matter of fact, they tried to.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Headworth {{had said}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> till after church, {{but there was}} no deferring the matter then.

60|$|And now I {{have lived}} to see the dissenters {{themselves}} very quiet, if not very well pleased with an act of parliament to prevent it. Their friends indeed laid it on; they would be friends indeed if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of taking it off again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in {{and have}} a drink," [...] he invited. [...] "I am just up from the House. I do wish you could get some of your {{military}} friends to stop worrying us, Norgate. Two hours to-night have been absolutely wasted because <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> National Service and heckle us about the territorials." ...|$|E
60|$|She had a {{beautiful}} way of sitting musing, gratefully, as if her heart were lit up. Sometimes she would turn to him, laughing, to tell him some little thing that had happened during the day. Then he would laugh, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> awhile, before the vital, physical silence was between them again.|$|E
50|$|Polgas then deduces that {{a recent}} series of robberies against the bank's {{customers}} were made possible because Estong used his {{business as a}} spotter for the suspects.

6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Isobel, [...] "I {{knew it was}} {{something}} of the sort. This," [...] she added with a flash of inspiration, [...] "is {{the result of the}} meddling of that old General Cubitte.

6000|$|... "I know it"--answered the widow, sharply. [...] "I know'd {{it at the}} time; {{but what}} could a lone woman do to set 'em right; and he a deacon of the meetin' the whull time? If <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of worldly things at such times, it wasn't for one like me to put 'em right." ...|$|E
60|$|The men lay {{about the}} stockade with their rusty guns beside them, the negro, Bad Dollar, filing his matchet, {{as he did}} continually. The man Dane called Monday, however, {{crouched}} close beside him. A curious friendship had sprung up between the two, and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> long together with mutual satisfaction, though neither of them fully understood his companion.|$|E
60|$|He {{spent most}} of the next morning nerving himself to face the garrulous world of the Athletic Club. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> about Paul; they would be lip-licking and rotten. But at the Roughnecks' Table they did not mention Paul. They spoke with zeal of the coming {{baseball}} season. He loved them as he never had before.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{computer}} {{support was}} delivered either {{by a person}} physically attending the premises where a computer was located or over the telephone with technicians on one end talking customers {{through a series of}} information gathering which was then relayed to the technician so that the technician could propose a solution which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> then <b>talk</b> the customer through implementing.|$|R
2500|$|In negotiations, one of Grossman's {{favorite}} techniques was silence. Musician manager Charlie Rothschild said of Grossman, [...] "He {{would simply}} stare {{at you and}} say nothing. He wouldn't volunteer any information, and that would drive people crazy. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> keep <b>talking</b> to fill the void, and say anything. He had a remarkable gift for tipping {{the balance of power}} in his favor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there we}} sits. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>would</b> all <b>talk</b> at once, {{sometimes}} {{two or three}} of them would give it me. Ten o'clock comes and they got desperate like, for only one or two of them had put anything into their pockets, thinking that the matter was sure to be finished that night.

60|$|Rilla wished <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of {{something}} besides war. She had heard nothing else {{for a week}} and she was really a little tired of it.

60|$|The {{trip to the}} {{southeast}} coast of Cuba lasted seven days. It was very hot, even for {{this time of the}} year, and those who could, slept on deck during the voyage. There was but little to do, and when not drilling, the men took it easy in the shade,--sleeping, chatting, or playing games. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of the future and wonder how much of real fighting lay before them.|$|E
6000|$|Concerning {{the cause}} of this death--his family would doubtless reject with vigour the {{suspicion}} of suicide, which was so compromising! They would take it as an accident, a stroke of fate. In their hearts they would even feel it an intervention of Providence, a retribution--had not Bosinney endangered their two most priceless possessions, the pocket and the hearth? And <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of 'that unfortunate accident of young Bosinney's,' but perhaps they would not talk--silence might be better! ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{to return}} to the Calabooza Beretanee. Immense was the {{interest}} we excited among the throngs that called there; <b>they</b> <b>would</b> stand <b>talking</b> about us by the hour, growing most unnecessarily excited too, and dancing up and down with all the vivacity of their race. They invariably sided with us; flying out against the consul, and denouncing him as [...] "Ita maitai nuee," [...] or very bad exceedingly. They must have borne him some grudge or other.|$|R
2500|$|... "Old Scouts" [...] Robert E. Strahorn, Captain Jack Crawford and Col. Buffalo Bill Cody {{shaped the}} popular {{vision of the}} American West through their images and narratives. At The Wigwam, the home of their friend Major Israel McCreight ("Cante Tanke") [...] in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, they could relax, smoke {{and talk about the}} Old West. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877, in later years <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> of it. All {{expressed}} remorse.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] the {{old woman}} said. [...] "They might have cut me in pieces without getting a single word from me as to where I lived. Still they might have found out somehow, for <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have been sure to have {{published}} the fact that I had been taken, {{with a description of}} me. Then the neighbours would have said, 'This description is like Louise Moulin, and she is missing;' and then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked,</b> and the end of it would have been you would have been discovered. Will you come home with us, Monsieur Sandwith?" ...|$|R
