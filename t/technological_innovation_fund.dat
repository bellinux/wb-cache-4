40|$|ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational {{modification}} that modulates {{the functions}} of many target proteins. We previously showed that the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA) induces the ADP-ribosylation of C-terminal-binding protein- 1 short-form/BFA-ADP-ribosylation substrate (CtBP 1 -S/BARS), a bifunctional protein with roles in the nucleus as a transcription factor and in the cytosol as a regulator of membrane fission during intracellular trafficking and mitotic partitioning of the Golgi complex. Here, we report that ADP-ribosylation of CtBP 1 -S/BARS by BFA occurs via a nonconventional mechanism that comprises two steps: (i) synthesis of a BFA-ADP-ribose conjugate by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD 38 and (ii) covalent binding of the BFA-ADP-ribose conjugate into the CtBP 1 -S/BARS NAD+-binding pocket. This results in the locking of CtBP 1 -S/BARS in a dimeric conformation, which prevents its binding to interactors known {{to be involved in}} membrane fission and, hence, in the inhibition of the fission machinery involved in mitotic Golgi partitioning. As this inhibition may lead to arrest of the cell cycle in G 2, these findings provide a strategy for the design of pharmacological blockers of cell cycle in tumor cells that express high levels of CD 38.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : Individuals {{carrying}} pathogenic {{mutations in}} the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes {{have a high}} lifetime risk of breast cancer. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are involved in DNA double-strand break repair, DNA alterations that {{can be caused by}} exposure to reactive oxygen species, a main source of which are mitochondria. Mitochondrial genome variations affect electron transport chain efficiency and reactive oxygen species production. Individuals with different mitochondrial haplogroups differ in their metabolism and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Variability in mitochondrial genetic background can alter reactive oxygen species production, leading to cancer risk. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial haplogroups modify breast cancer risk in BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers. METHODS : We genotyped 22, 214 (11, 421 affected, 10, 793 unaffected) mutation carriers belonging to the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA 1 / 2 for 129 mitochondrial polymorphisms using the iCOGS array. Haplogroup inference and association detection were performed using a phylogenetic approach. ALTree was applied to explore the reference mitochondrial evolutionary tree and detect subclades enriched in affected or unaffected individuals. RESULTS : We discovered that subclade T 1 a 1 was depleted in affected BRCA 2 mutation carriers compared with the rest of clade T (hazard ratio (HR) = 0. 55; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 34 to 0. 88; P = 0. 01). Compared with the most frequent haplogroup in the general population (that is, H and T clades), the T 1 a 1 haplogroup has a HR of 0. 62 (95 % CI, 0. 40 to 0. 95; P = 0. 03). We also identified three potential susceptibility loci, including G 13708 A/rs 28359178, which has demonstrated an inverse association with familial breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS : This study illustrates how original approaches such as the phylogeny-based method we used can empower classical molecular epidemiological studies aimed at identifying association or risk modification effects.

The results show that R&D intensity has a positive effect on continuous <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> and family management moderates negatively this relationship. Our findings also suggest that the influence of the family management significantly contribute to improve the effect of the <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> on sustained performance. It seems that some family-managed firms characteristics (nepotism,…) could hinder the efficient conversion of R&D expenditures into continuous <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> outcomes, but once family-managed firms have obtained <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> outcomes, they become riskier and put all its social capital to work to improve the conversion of innovation outcomes into performance. Therefore, family involvement in management looks influence <b>technological</b> <b>innovation</b> efficiency...|$|R

Firms whose continuously innovate will be more adaptive and competitive in changing market. The firm’s need to innovate is in almost all industrial sectors, including clean water technology industry. The diversity of water treatment technology emerged to meet various need of user. This study aims to examine how the different characteristics of users influence the degree of innovations novelty produced by water treatment technology manufacturers. The method used is a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodsthrough conducting surveys and in-depth interviews. The results showed that differences in the characteristics of users will influence the degree of novelty of innovation in water treatment technology industries. There are three characteristics that influence the degree of novelty of innovation, namely technology needs, <b>innovation</b> <b>funding</b> and user involvement in the development process of innovation. Efficiency based innovation, flexibility of <b>innovation</b> <b>funding,</b> and increasing user involvement in the development of innovation will increase the degree of novelty of <b>innovation.</b> Keywords: <b>technological</b> <b>innovation,</b> water treatment, degree of novelty, user, industrial surve...|$|R
