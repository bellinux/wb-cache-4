5|$|After {{seeing the}} {{preliminary}} pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers {{realized there was}} no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} {{days after the}} war, {{contradictory}} reports arose as to Bormann's whereabouts. Sightings were reported in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere. Bormann's wife was placed under surveillance in case he tried to contact her. Jakob Glas, Bormann's long-time chauffeur, insisted that he saw Bormann in Munich in July 1946. In case Bormann was still alive, multiple public notices about the upcoming Nuremberg trials were placed in newspapers and on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> October and November 1945 to notify him of the proceedings against him.|$|E
5|$|Television variety {{shows are}} the widest venue for popular music. They change often, but Buona Domenica, Domenica In, and I raccomandati are popular.

5|$|Hergé {{incorporated}} several characters {{into the}} story who had previously been introduced in earlier Adventures; this included Dr. Müller, a German villain who had previously appeared in The Black Island, and the Portuguese merchant Oliviera da Figueira, who had first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh. Hergé also included {{a reference to the}} recurring character Bianca Castafiore, whose singing appears on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> one scene. He also introduced a number of new characters in the story; this included the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab, a character who was based largely on Ibn Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia, whom Hergé had learned about from a 1939 book by Anton Zischke. It has also been suggested that the character was partly inspired by the deceased Iraqi leader, Faisal I. The character of the Emir's son, Prince Abdullah, was inspired by the King of Iraq, Faisal II, who was appointed monarch in 1939 aged four, although in creating this character Hergé had also been influenced by an obnoxious child character that appears in the work of O. Henry.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, British {{alternative}} {{rock was}} distinguished {{from that of}} the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{prevented}} a swift Soviet breakthrough into Estonia {{and gave the}} underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia enough time to attempt to re-establish Estonian independence. On 1 August 1944, the national committee pronounced itself Estonia's highest authority and on 18 September 1944, acting head of state Uluots appointed a new government led by Otto Tief. Over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> English, the government declared its neutrality in the war. The government issued two editions of the Riigi Teataja (State Gazette) but {{did not have time}} to distribute them. On 21 September, the national forces seized the government buildings in Toompea, Tallinn and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Estonia was hoisted at the tower of Pikk Hermann, to be removed by the Soviets four days later. The Estonian Government in Exile served to carry the continuity of the Estonian state forward until 1992, when it handed its credentials over to the incoming President, Lennart Meri.|$|E

Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was just east of the control tower.

25|$|The Yeomen of the Guard was {{immediately}} {{a hit in}} London, with a successful New York run following shortly thereafter. Percy Anderson designed the original costumes, while the set was by Hawes Craven. The first English provincial tour opened in 1888, {{and from then on}} it was a fixture in the D'Oyly Carte repertory, with at least one official touring company playing it somewhere in almost every season until the company's closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Anderson in 1919 and 1927, and Peter Goffin designed new sets and costumes in 1940. In Australia, the opera's first authorised performance was on 20 April 1889 at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, produced by J. C.
