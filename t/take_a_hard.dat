This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> enough fall.

25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred canal construction {{up and down the}} East Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations in less than two years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round freight transportation, but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen {{were going to have to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> careful look.

25|$|Those five former {{officers}} were Geoff Sims, Steve Schaefer, Dave Cook, Rich Mann, and Rod Keeling, {{the head of}} the new governing body that was the ABA company pilot who rose to the rank of Vice President of Marketing. Previous to the piloting position with the ABA, he had no experience with BMX racing. Mr. Keeling had departed the ABA on March 2, 1984 and announced the creation of the new governing body on March 23, 1984. Some thought the creation of the USBA was timed {{to take advantage of the}} ABA's financial dire straits and to cause a stampede of ABA tracks to change affiliation to the new organization. Mennenga saw it as a personal betrayal to the point that he called a press conference to denounce them. He charged at that press conference that it was they who had given him bad advice to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> uncompromising line against the track owners, the racers, and the BMX press. His basic charge was that their collective advice was deliberate sabotage to undermine the ABA so they could make this move to set up their own governing body and destroy the ABA. This was a tactic not unknown to Mennenga. During a 1981 dispute with the promoters of the large-pursed ($10,000) Knott's Berry Farm race, the ABA bristled at being scheduled directly opposite, i.e. on the same Thanksgiving weekend as, their prestigious Grand National in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. That it was sanctioned by the NBL, being run under NBL rules and racers received national points at that race as they would at a national created directly by the NBL, exacerbated already raw feelings between the NBL and the ABA. The ABA felt it was a deliberate action to siphon off racers, particularly the pros from their season-ending Grand National. The hiring by the Knott's Berry promoter Thomas Henn of former NBA founder and President Ernie Alexander to run the race (he also designed the temporary track at Knott's) didn't help matters. Alexander had a reputation of deliberately scheduling NBA events against the events of other sanctioning bodies when he ran the NBA. Mennenga sent out press releases and faxes to the BMX press, track operators and bicycle manufactures allegedly hinting that they should boycott persons and organizations that participated in the Knott's Berry race. The ABA allegedly had a boycott list that had many notables of the BMX industry on it, including promoter Renny Roker, which the ABA ordered tracks to boycott his upcoming Pro seven race series that would later come to be known as the ESPN Pro Spectacular. Several ABA tracks left the ABA and joined Roker to participate in his series which were to be NBL sanctioned. With this siege mentality in his background it was easy for Mennenga to believe that USBA stole the valuable ABA membership records to proposition ABA racers to join the USBA. While the value of this list would be a motive to steal it, Mennenga provided no evidence.|$|E

500|$|The Astonishing has {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album holds an average score of 80, based on six reviews.

[...] Rolling Stone echoed these sentiments, concluding, [...] "The results won't please every Dream Theater partisan, nor will they convert the skeptical. But it would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> heart to deny Petrucci, co-composer and keyboardist Jordan Rudess and their mates credit for the boldness of their aspirations and the assurance with which they achieve them."

His major opposition in the Democratic primary came from secretary of state Bob Babbage and President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate John [...] "Eck" [...] Rose. Although sitting governor Brereton Jones did not officially endorse Patton, Rose referred to Jones as Patton's [...] "mentor". Rose charged that, like Jones, Patton would not <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> stand on the issues; referring to a nickname given to Jones in the 1991 campaign, Rose remarked [...] "If you have liked Jell-O Jones, then {{you are going to}} be in a position to love Puddin' Paul Patton." [...] Particularly odious to Rose was that Patton had publicly supported collective wage bargaining for public employees, but had declared that he would not fight for it in the upcoming 1996 legislative session. Though Babbage and Rose were political veterans and solid campaigners, Patton won 152,203votes in the primary, well over the 40percent needed to avoid a runoff.

500|$|Following the {{downfall}} of the Ngô family, the White House came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> line against Cẩn. Mass graves containing 200 bodies were found on his land. The US consul in Huế, John Helble, confirmed the existence of rows of 18th-century style dungeons with filthy, dark cells in an old French arsenal. Although junta member General Trần Văn Đôn asserted that the compound predated the Diệm era, the town's citizens saw Cẩn as a mass murderer. On 4 November, two days after the coup ended, thousands of irate townspeople walked three kilometres to Cẩn's house on the city's southern outskirts — where he lived with his aged mother — demanding vengeance. The junta had ringed the home with barbed wire and armoured cars, sensing that the populace would riot and attack Cẩn. By this time, Cẩn had escaped to a Catholic seminary, but was considering applying to the Americans for political asylum. The U.S. State Department was faced with a dilemma: sheltering Cẩn would associate them with the protection of a corrupt and authoritarian regime that had killed and tortured hundreds of thousands of its own people. Allowing Cẩn to be attacked by angry mobs would damage the reputation of the new American-backed junta. The State Department instructed: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{deal was}} signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed {{all of the}} {{commercial}} rights to Formula One to him for 15years, {{on the condition that}} they would return to the FIA {{at the end of that}} period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> line with me as we had worked together for so long."

Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams.
