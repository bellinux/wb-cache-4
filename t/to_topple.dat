5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E

Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of the Revolution during the siege.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} {{of a civil}} war between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was supported by external powers, with each of the regimes trying <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the armistice (ceasefire agreement) was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{resistance}} was <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease.

5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was old enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the Lithuanian government.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{had become}} the key {{logistical}} artery for PAVN and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF or commonly, Viet Cong), {{in their effort to}} conduct military operations <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

5|$|France invaded {{and began}} occupying Syria in 1919 and {{following}} the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, Faisal was exiled and the kingdom annulled. Al-Bakri left for Amman in Transjordan, which was {{under the authority of}} Faisal's brother King Abdullah. Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to Syria after the French issued amnesty for political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the French authorities in Syria and align the country with the ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz. The Hashemites were driven out of the latter in 1925 by the Saudis.|$|E
5|$|In July 1994 {{one of his}} sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led {{a failed}} coup attempt <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the {{government}}. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, but government troops soon discovered his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives {{to allow him to}} go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry's headquarters, convinced that there was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to the safer location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E
50|$|Aspects of Chimwenje's {{ideology}} and agenda remain unclear. It was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>toppling</b> Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, and first entered prominence in mid-1995. The group retained somewhat ambiguous political ties to prominent Zimbabwean opposition leader Ndabaningi Sithole, and its ranks included several known associates of Sithole, {{including one of}} his former bodyguards. In October 1995 Sithole was arrested on suspicion that he was involved with a Chimwenje plot to assassinate President Mugabe. When questioned he expressed awareness of the militants and simply stated that they were Zimbabwean exiles who wished to return to their country.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} in California {{took a different}} shape, less concerned about elections. Chicanos in Los Angeles formed alliances with other oppressed people who identified with the Third World Left and were committed <b>to</b> <b>toppling</b> U.S. imperialism and fighting racism. The Brown Berets, with links to the Black Panther Party, was one manifestation of the multiracial context in Los Angeles. The Chicano Moratorium antiwar protests of 1970 and 1971 also reflected the vibrant collaboration between African Americans, Japanese Americans, American Indians, and white antiwar activists that had developed in Southern California.|$|R

5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people {{to emulate the}} Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and telling them (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona svikiro (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any svikiro who gained significant popularity.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{a guerrilla}} {{war between the}} Federation of Malaya—a {{protectorate}} of Britain until August 1957, {{and part of the}} Commonwealth of Nations thereafter—and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The MNLA sought <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the Malayan government and force the British out, while the Commonwealth worked to prevent this. The conflict had its roots in the Second World War, in which groups of local ethnic Chinese fought alongside Britain's limited forces in the country against the occupying Imperial Japanese; these Malayan Chinese subscribed to communist political thinking, and called themselves the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in Comoros), on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} Comoros, backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, {{in defiance of the}} federal government and the AU. The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E
40|$|The {{toppling}} (or `tip-over') {{of soccer}} goalposts {{has resulted in}} many human injuries and fatalities worldwide. One design of a soccer goalpost, the `free-standing' type, is particularly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>toppling.</b> This paper presents analyses of the safety and design issues surrounding free-standing goalposts. First, a mathematical route for the generation of topple data is outlined. Second, data-sets for Mini-Soccer goalposts are used <b>to</b> scrutinise real-world <b>toppling</b> scenarios. Design steps are proposed for reducing the likelihood of (and subsequent severity of injury from) goalpost toppling. The results are compared against current safety provision contained in the British Standards Institution's (BSI) documents BS EN 748 : 1996 and PAS 36 - 1 / 2 : 2000. It is intended that manufacturers apply the analysis techniques outlined in this paper to gather quantitative data on {{the safety of their}} own products...|$|R
2500|$|While {{generally}} considered a beautiful design, the Cross of Sacrifice {{is not a}} robust one.

5|$|In November 2001, {{as part of}} Operation Enduring Freedom {{with the}} United States, the United Kingdom invaded Afghanistan <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the Taliban in Operation Herrick. The 3rd Division were {{deployed}} in Kabul {{to assist in the}} liberation of the capital and defeat Taliban forces in the mountains. In 2006 the British Army began concentrating on fighting Taliban forces and bringing security to Helmand Province, with around 9,500 British troops (including marines, airmen and sailors) deployed at its peak—the second-largest force after that of the US. In December 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the combat mission would end in 2014, and troop numbers gradually fell as the Afghan National Army took over the brunt of the fighting. Between 2001 and 26 April 2014 a total of 453 British military personnel died in Afghan operations. Operation Herrick ended with the handover of Camp Bastion on 26 October 2014, but the British Army maintains a deployment in Afghanistan as part of Operation Toral.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd via Vyborg. There, Lenin attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued his case that the party should lead an armed insurrection of their supporters <b>to</b> <b>topple</b> the Provisional Government. This time, he was successful in his argument, and the motion was ratified with ten votes against two. Those critical of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, expressed the view that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the existing regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet with the Provisional Government's support during the Kornilov Affair; the MRC consisted largely of those loyal to the Bolsheviks.|$|E
