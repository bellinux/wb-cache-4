Whilst new machinery such as laser screeding plant has helped in providing quicker and more accurate concrete placement, the greater size of the pour creates an increased risk of thermal and hygral movement. All concrete slabs must consequently accommodate significant shrinkage throughout their lifespan, because if restricted, additional stresses and cracking will occur. Some form of control to prevent premature degradation is therefore required within the structure. This is commonly achieved with the use of joints (controlled cracks) to enable the concrete to move at designated locations, leaving the remainder of the slab relatively free of restraint-induced stress.

High-affinity potassium transporter (HKTs) has been proven to be involved <b>in</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>in</b> plants. Therefore, we screened for natural nucleotide polymorphism in the coding sequence of OsHKT 1, which encodes the HKT protein in eight Vietnamese rice cultivars differing <b>in</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>level.</b> <b>In</b> total, seven nucleotide substitutions in coding sequence of OsHKT 1 were found, including two non-synonymous and five synonymous substitutions. Further analysis revealed that these two non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions (G 50 T and T 1209 A) caused changes in amino acids (Gly 17 Val and Asp 403 Glu) at signal peptide and the loop of the sixth transmembrane domain, respectively. To assess the potential effect of these substitutions on the protein function, the 3 D structure of HKT protein variants was modelled by using PHYRE 2 webserver. The results showed that no difference was observed when compared those predicted 3 D structure of HKT protein variants with each other. In addition, the codon bias of synonymous substitutions cannot clearly show correlation with salt tolerance level.

The effects of two levels of salinity, 100 (T 1) and 300 (T 2) mM NaCI, on plant growth and on some physiological parameters were measured. Leaf and root Na+ accumulation differed among landraces. 12 reduced growth and seed yield in all landraces with maximum inhibition relative to controls in R 49. Salinity negatively affected chlorophyll and total polyphenol content (TPC) in VI- 1 and Villarrica but not R 49. Germination on saline or control media of seeds harvested from plants treated or not with NaCI was sometimes different; the best performing landrace was R 49 insofar as 45 - 65 % of seeds germinated on 500 mM NaCl-containing medium. In all landraces, average seedling root length declined strongly with increasing NaCI concentration, but roots of R 49 were significantly longer than those of VI- 1 and Villarrica up to 300 mM NaCI. Salt caused increases in seed TPC relative to controls, but radical scavenging capacity was higher only in seeds from T 2 plants of R 49. Total SDS-extractable seed proteins were resolved into distinct bands (10 - 70 kDa) with some evident differences between landraces. Salt-induced changes in protein patterns were landrace-specific.

Towards this goal, we sought ecological gradients of divergence between the cryptic malaria vectors Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae {{and then looked}} for a physiological trait that may underlie such divergence.
