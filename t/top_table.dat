5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to walk out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they searched for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the <b>top</b> <b>table,</b> however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E

25|$|In just {{its first}} season {{back in the}} top flight 2000–01 French Division 1, Lille {{qualified}} for Europe {{for the first time}} in the club's history, booking its place in the 2000–01 Champions League. On the back of the club's new status, Lille entered into a decisive new era under the guidance of chairman and Chief executive officer Michel Seydoux and coach Claude Puel. The club left the historical Stade Grimonprez-Jooris to join the Stadium Lille Métropole and became a regular on the European scene. Amongst its most emphatic results was the 1–0 victory over Manchester United at the Stade de France in 2005, the 2–0 triumph over Milan in San Siro in 2006 and the 1–0 home win over Liverpool in 2010. A steady development off the pitch (inauguration of the Domaine de Luchin training complex in 2007, opening of the Grand Stade in 2012), coupled with the sporting progression under the expert hand of coach Rudi García, took Lille back to the summit of the French game with the League and Cup double in 2011 (56 years after the club's last trophy). In 2012, LOSC confirmed its place at the <b>top</b> <b>table</b> of the domestic game with another qualification for Europe's most prestigious club competition, the Champions League in 2012–13. With the club finishing just outside the UCL places that season, García left to join Roma, while former Montpellier coach René Girard was appointed the new Lille manager. After two years in charge of the club, Girard left his role as the head coach by mutual consent. He was joined by assistants Gerard Bernadet and Nicolas Girard in making the exit. In May 2015, the Ivory Coast national team head coach Hervé Renard was appointed as the new manager.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci observed that the song [...] "treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs" [...] on the album. Writing for Clash magazine, Mike Diver praised Beyoncé's vocal performance noting, [...] "When Beyoncé truly unleashes her vocals on ballad-tempo moments... 'Jealous', she immediately casts long shadows over singers who might have tried to shift her from the <b>top</b> <b>table</b> of pop". Mike Wass of Idolator considered [...] "Jealous" [...] to be an update of the singer's [...] "If I Were a Boy", sung by a grown woman. He went on to praise the [...] "frank, honest and vulnerable" [...] characteristics the singer decided to showcase in the song, opposed to her other material where she was reluctant to discuss about them. Wass finished his review by noting that [...] "Jealous" [...] would be a [...] "dark horse for a radio single down the line". Brittany Spanos of The Village Voice described the song as a [...] "grown up version" [...] of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] with lyrics about [...] "persistent mistrust". Latifah Muhammad of BET deemed the song a [...] "distant cousin" [...] to [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] and stated that its turning point comes during several lines of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|After {{an absence}} of six years, a period which also saw McCarthy serve a one-year ban from the game, St. Finbarr's {{returned}} to the <b>top</b> <b>table</b> of Cork hurling once again. In spite of being regarded as underdogs against Blackrock, Con Roche gave a masterful display in helping the Barr's to a 2–17 to 2–14 victory. It was McCarthy's third championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents in the subsequent provincial decider A low-scoring 0–7 to 0–3 victory gave McCarthy his second Munster medal, however, the game was tinged with sadness for St. Finbarr's as an horrific shine-bone injury brought Bernie Scully's career to an end. The All-Ireland final on St. Patrick's weekend saw St. Finbarr's take on the Fenians of Kilkenny.

Allmusic's Michael Sutton found [...] "there's an undeniably spiritual feel {{to several of}} the songs" [...] where [...] "David McComb spews his words with the fiery passion of a backwoods preacher". Sutton advises [...] "Fans of Nick Cave will immediately be seduced by McComb's bluesy croon; deep and brimming with palpable sorrow, [...] voice never dwindles in intensity". David Fricke writing for Rolling Stone observed that the album [...] "is about the chills and delusions suffered by lovers separated too long {{from each other and}} from reality". Mathur and Phillips summarised, [...] " [...] is a precise and masterful record. Eleven songs and one instrumental together illustrate the heights which such finely crafted music can attain". NMEs Stephen Worthy reviewed the 2007 version and felt it was [...] "even more difficult to understand why [...] weren’t at rock’s <b>top</b> <b>table</b> with U2 and R.E.M.". Mess+Noises Lauren Zoric compared the 2007 versions of Calenture and In the Pines (originally issued in 1986), [...] "Calenture emerged from the woolshed chrysalis. It is The Triffids' pop album, and remains a sweeping, majestic masterpiece. McComb's voice is overwhelming, a terrifying embodiment of ruinous emotions reined into literary form".|$|E

2500|$|A {{new wave}} of pop punk groups had sprung up {{sometime}} around 2010. Dave Beech of Clash noted that these groups were [...] "arker and more mature" [...] than those previously, taking [...] influence [...] "and occasional indifference" [...] from [...] On The Wonder Years' The Upsides (2010), vocalist Dan Campbell sung about [...] "His early twenties soul-searching and tales of strife" [...] which [...] "resonated with a [...] generation, inspiring countless imitators in the process." [...] This pushed Campbell to [...] "the forefront of a new wave", and the album influencing a {{new wave of}} pop punk bands. The Story So Far's second album, What You Don't See (2013), [...] "cemented their place at the <b>top</b> <b>table</b> of nu pop-punk". Rock Sound included The Wonder Years' The Greatest Generation on their best albums of 2013 list, calling it [...] "the defining album of what may well have been the genre's best year for a decade." [...] Kerrang! said the album [...] "ripped up the pop-punk blueprint" [...] pushing the genre to [...] "new peaks of invention, both lyrically and musically." [...] In early 2014, Welsh band Neck Deep released their debut album Wishful Thinking, which Rock Sound later called it [...] "the greatest UK pop-punk record of all time." [...] Also in 2014, Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer's self titled album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and in many other countries, prompting Alternative Press to describe the band as important to the marketing of the pop-punk scene.|$|E
