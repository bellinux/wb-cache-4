5|$|As {{the women}} {{go back to}} the factory, Micaëla returns and gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother ("Parle-moi de ma mère!"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on {{learning}} <b>this.</b> <b>Just</b> as José declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance ("Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi"); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.|$|E

He joined Peyton Manning and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to do <b>this,</b> <b>just</b> the week after {{the two of them}} achieved the accomplishment. On Thanksgiving 2007, Favre led the Packers to a 37–26 win over the Lions, and brought the Packers to a 10–1 record. He won the Galloping Gobbler award, given by the broadcasters at Fox to the game's MVP. Favre threw three touchdown passes for his 63rd career game with at least three touchdowns, surpassing Marino's former record of 62.|$|E

The incriminating letter falls out, but it is quickly taken up by Stankar and torn into many pieces, much to the fury of Stiffelio.|$|E

The changeling queen, Queen Chrysalises, imprisoned and impersonated Cadence, so she could feed off Shining Armor's love for her. Twilight Sparkle discovered <b>this</b> <b>just</b> before the imposter of Cadence and Shining Armor could be wed.

25|$|The Fort Thompson {{line that}} had been set up by General Hill {{extended}} only from the river to the railroad. They ended on the right in a brickyard that would figure prominently in the fighting. Because the land farther to the right was fairly firm and would allow his position to be flanked, General Branch decided to extend the line beyond the railroad and end it in a swamp. <b>This</b> <b>just</b> about doubled the length of the defensive line. He made a major blunder in laying out the line, however. In haste to complete the extension and faced with an exasperating shortage of labor, he decided to use a small creek as a natural part of the line. This creek intersected the railroad at a point some 150 yards (135 meters) up from the brickyard. The line of breastworks therefore had a dogleg in its center.|$|E

25|$|Work {{started to}} convert the corporation's lines to {{electric}} power in 1898. The first to be done was from the Market Avenue to Prince Rock which was operated by electric trams from 22 January 1899. Electricity was supplied from the corporation's own power station at Cattewater (near {{the eastern end of}} the line) and a new tram depot was built in Elliot Road. The electrification was soon extended from Market Avenue to the Theatre. The first six electric cars were equipped to haul an old horse tram as a trailer, but this practice was discontinued after a derailment in Old Town Street. 4 April 1901 saw the route to Compton turned over to electric operation. A new electric route eastwards to Beaumont Road was opened on 2 April 1902. The horse trams to Peverell were replaced by electric on 13 January 1903, and those to Pennycomequick on 21 September 1905. <b>This</b> <b>just</b> left horse trams on the West Hoe route, which was converted on 22 June 1907.|$|E
25|$|Considerable scepticism is {{therefore}} warranted {{as to whether}} this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed {{to the body of}} the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do <b>this</b> <b>just</b> before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that <b>this</b> <b>just</b> made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of them want to remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E

25|$|In March 2016, Pakistan was {{eliminated}} from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing to India, New Zealand and Australia. Many were left disappointed after this and the PCB announced they would take action. There were initial talks that Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal could face a potential 2-year ban following their poor performance {{but this was not}} verified. However, the focus was on Waqar Younis and Shahid Afridi. The highlight of this was that Waqar Younis had written up a 6-page report on recommendations along with discreet reasons he though contributed to the failure. However, the PCB were accused of leaking this report to the media, where all details were publicised, particularly popularising the fact Waqar thought it was Afridi's fault. The PCB then refused to meet with Younis, confirming to most that they were responsible in leaking the files. Younis announced his resignation due to <b>this</b> <b>just</b> after Afridi resigned as T20 captain in April 2016. He said the PCB's actions were a disgrace. The PCB apologised to Waqar Younis for the leak on 6 April 2016.|$|E

25|$|By 600, the {{establishment}} of the first Anglo-Saxon 'emporia' was in prospect. There seem to have been over thirty of such units, many of which were certainly controlled by kings, in the parts of Britain which the Anglo-Saxons controlled. Bede's use of the term imperium has been seen as significant in defining the status and powers of the bretwaldas, in fact it is a word Bede used regularly as an alternative to regnum; scholars believe <b>this</b> <b>just</b> meant the collection of tribute. Oswiu's extension of overlordship over the Picts and Scots is expressed in terms of making them tributary. Military overlordship could bring great short-term success and wealth, but the system had its disadvantages. Many of the overlords enjoyed their powers for a relatively short period. Foundations had to be carefully laid to turn a tribute-paying under-kingdom into a permanent acquisition, such as Bernician absorption of Deira. The smaller kingdoms did not disappear without trace once they were incorporated into larger polities; on the contrary their territorial integrity was preserved when they became ealdormanries or, depending on size, parts of ealdormanries within their new kingdoms. An obvious example of this tendency for later boundaries to preserve earlier arrangements is Sussex; the county boundary is essentially {{the same as that of}} the West Saxon shire and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Witan, also called Witenagemot, was the council of kings; its essential duty was to advise the king on all matters on which he chose to ask its opinion. It attested his grants of land to churches or laymen, consented to his issue of new laws or new statements of ancient custom, and helped him deal with rebels and persons suspected of disaffection.|$|E
