5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych <b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 <b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a 1944 {{triptych}} {{painted by}} the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon. The canvasses {{are based on}} the Eumenides—or Furies—of Aeschylus's Oresteia, and depict three writhing anthropomorphic creatures set against a flat burnt orange background. It was executed in oil paint and pastel on Sundeala fibre board and completed within two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for almost twenty years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that <b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> was the fons et origo of his career. He destroyed many of his earlier canvasses, and tried to suppress those that had left his studio. Bacon was emphatic that no pre-1944 images be admitted into his canon, {{and most of the}} early art critics agreed with this position. The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych, and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{panels of}} <b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a {{material}} Bacon was using {{at the time}} as an inexpensive alternative to canvas. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, {{due in part to the}} low level of oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E

25|$|In January 1937, at Thomas Agnew and Sons, 43 Old Bond Street, London, Bacon {{exhibited}} {{in a group}} show, Young British Painters, which included Graham Sutherland, Victor Pasmore and Roy de Maistre. Eric Hall, also a friend of Jerry Agnew, organised the show; Agnew's was then known for shows of Old Master paintings. Four works by Bacon were shown: Figures in a Garden (1936), purchased by Diana Watson; Abstraction, and Abstraction from the Human Form, known from magazine photographs. They prefigure <b>Three</b> <b>Studies</b> for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944) in alternatively representing a tripod structure (Abstraction), bared teeth (Abstraction from the Human Form), and both being biomorphic in form.

25|$|The <b>three</b> <b>studies</b> that {{initially}} found that high-dose mannitol {{was effective in}} cases of severe head injury were {{the subject of an}} investigation published in 2007.

Further, the Federal University of São Paulo, which Dr. Cruz gave as his affiliation, has never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only 4 studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol could not be reached.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{correcting}} static vision on sports vision {{is still not}} clear. Aim: To examine whether sports vision (depth perception [DP], dynamic visual acuity [DVA], eye movement [EM], peripheral vision [PV], and momentary vision [MV],) were different among soft tennis adolescent athletes with normal vision (Group A), with refractive error and corrected with (Group B) and without eyeglasses (Group C). Setting and Design: A cross-section study was conducted. Soft tennis athletes aged 10 – 13 who played softball tennis for 2 – 5 years, and who were without any ocular diseases and without visual training for the past 3 months were recruited. Materials and Methods: DPs were measured in an absolute deviation (mm) between a moving rod and fixing rod (approaching at 25 mm/s, receding at 25 mm/s, approaching at 50 mm/s, receding at 50 mm/s) using electric DP tester. A smaller deviation represented better DP. DVA, EM, PV, and MV were measured {{on a scale from}} 1 (worse) to 10 (best) using ATHLEVISION software. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test and Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the data among the <b>three</b> <b>study</b> groups. Results: A total of 73 athletes (37 in Group A, 8 in Group B, 28 in Group C) were enrolled in this study. All four items of DP showed significant difference among the <b>three</b> <b>study</b> groups (P = 0. 0051, 0. 0004, 0. 0095, 0. 0021). PV displayed significant difference among the <b>three</b> <b>study</b> groups (P = 0. 0044). There {{was no significant difference in}} DVA, EM, and MV among the <b>three</b> <b>study</b> groups. Conclusions: Significant better DP and PV were seen among soft tennis adolescent athletes with normal vision than those with refractive error regardless whether they had eyeglasses corrected. On the other hand, DVA, EM, and MV were similar among the <b>three</b> <b>study</b> groups...|$|R
