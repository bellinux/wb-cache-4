5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> summer populations, but most adults {{from the earlier}} {{emergence}} die {{before the end of}} summer.

Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
