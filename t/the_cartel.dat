5|$|Claude {{then begins}} {{working for the}} city's Yakuza and its leader Asuka Kasen (Lianna Pai), Maria's close friend, who has Claude assassinate Salvatore and get his revenge. This cuts off all of Claude's ties with the Leone family, who are now against him. Claude's work leads him to allying himself with other {{criminal}} sources, such as corrupt police detective Ray Machowski (Robert Loggia), an enemy of <b>the</b> <b>Cartel.</b> Claude later saves him from Internal Affairs and the CIA by helping him flee to Vice City. Claude also meets charismatic media mogul Donald Love (Kyle MacLachlan), who maintains a huge media front. In an effort to start a war between the Yakuza and Cartel, Claude and Love organise the death of Asuka's brother Kenji Kasen (Les Mau) and blame <b>the</b> <b>Cartel.</b> Later, Love asks Claude to rescue {{a man who was}} kidnapped by <b>the</b> <b>Cartel</b> in the prison truck that Claude was in. While on an errand, Claude finally confronts Catalina, who narrowly escapes. Asuka abducts Catalina's partner Miguel (Al Espinosa), believing him to have knowledge of her brother's death.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before his}} death, Blancornelas {{speculated that the}} Tijuana Cartel had placed a US$250,000 bounty on his assassination, and {{publicly}} said {{that he wanted to}} interview Enedina Arellano Félix, a female drug lord of <b>the</b> <b>cartel,</b> to confirm the information.|$|E
5|$|With the {{war with}} <b>the</b> <b>Cartel</b> intensifying, Asuka and Maria learn of Claude's history with Catalina and order him to attack many Cartel operations. Eventually, his {{exploits}} {{attract the attention of}} Catalina. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Cartel</b> kidnap Maria, murder Asuka and Miguel, and demand Claude to pay a $500,000 ransom in exchange for Maria's release. When Claude confronts Catalina, she attempts to have him killed, but he escapes. In the resulting firefight, Catalina attempts to flee in a helicopter and makes a final attempt on Claude's life. After killing the remaining Cartel members and rescuing Maria, Claude shoots down the helicopter, effectively killing Catalina. As they are leaving the scene, Maria complains to Claude about the kidnapping, particularly the state of her appearance. During the credits, a gunshot is heard, and Maria's voice is silenced.|$|E

In response to the photo publication, <b>the</b> <b>cartel</b> attempted to kill Blancornelas in 1997, but he managed to survive the attack and continued to report on the workings of Mexico's criminal underworld.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{surrounding}} {{these allegations}} were around since Moreno González was declared dead by the Mexican government in 2010.

5|$|Born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Antonio {{initially}} {{worked as}} a car washer at a local police station with his brother Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, former leader of <b>the</b> <b>cartel.</b> By the late 1980s, he entered the drug trade, and later became the crime boss of Matamoros, where he controlled the city's drug trafficking shipments and all organized crime activities. Few details were known of Antonio's criminal career prior to 1999, when his brother Osiel confronted federal agents at gunpoint with several of his gunmen in Matamoros. In 1998, Antonio avoided arrest after FBI and DEA agents tracked his whereabouts inside a domicile in Houston. Back in Mexico, his brother Osiel was the Gulf Cartel's main leader and had created a paramilitary squad known as Los Zetas, formed by soldiers who left the Mexican military.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Sonora <b>Cartel,</b> {{also known}} as Caro-Quintero Organization, was a Mexico based {{criminal}} cartel. [...] Upon of <b>the</b> <b>cartel's</b> disintegration, its leaders were incorporated into <b>the</b> Tijuana <b>Cartel</b> and Sinaloa Cartel.|$|R

The battle eventually resulted in defeat for <b>the</b> Juárez <b>Cartel</b> but not before taking the lives of between 5000 and 12,000 people in drug-related violence. During the war for the turf in Ciudad Juárez <b>the</b> Sinaloa <b>Cartel</b> used several gangs (e.g. Los Mexicles, the Artistas Asesinos and Gente Nueva) to attack <b>the</b> Juárez <b>Cartel.</b> <b>The</b> Juárez <b>Cartel</b> similarly used gangs such as La Línea and the Barrio Azteca to fight <b>the</b> Sinaloa <b>Cartel.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although Calderón {{set out to}} end {{the violent}} warfare between rival cartel leaders, critics argue that he {{inadvertently}} made the problem worse. The methods that Calderón adopted involved confronting <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> directly. These aggressive methods have resulted in public killings and torture from both <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> and <b>the</b> country’s own government forces, which aids in perpetuating the fear and apprehension that the citizens of Mexico have regarding {{the war on drugs}} and its negative stigma. As cartel leaders are being removed from their positions, either in the form of arrest or death, power struggles for leadership in <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> have become more intense, resulting in enhanced violence within <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as leader of La Familia Michoacana, Moreno González {{reportedly}} gave loans to farmers, funded schools and churches, financed drainage projects, and carried out several aid campaigns to help out the disadvantaged {{in the state of}} Michoacán. This, along with the manpower of the organization, allowed him get the support of several rural sectors in the state, where many served as informants and collaborators for <b>the</b> <b>cartel.</b> His wife was also known for organizing several self-help seminars in Apatzingán. The support of La Familia Michoacana is rooted in family connections and local communities in Michoacán, and in the supposed exploitation of its citizens by the government.|$|E

Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. <b>The</b> <b>cartel</b> offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Ramírez Treviño's boss {{triggered}} a war within the Gulf Cartel, {{resulting in the}} deaths and arrests of several high-ranking drug traffickers from 2011 to 2013. When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of <b>the</b> <b>cartel.</b> In efforts to keep the Gulf Cartel under a single command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking drug trafficker El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa.

Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization. With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{nationalization}} of the Asian fields causes financial ruin that affects <b>the</b> <b>cartel</b> members and J.R. Ewing's banker.

J.R. attempts to run both Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby) and Alan Beam (Randolph Powell) out of town as they both plot revenge against him. He also attempts to move Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) back into a sanitarium. With Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) having sought revenge upon J.R. based on an agreement he realized Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Digger Barnes (Keenan Wynn) had, J.R. has the oil fields stopped to keep Cliff from earning any royalties.

By June, not having come across a single ship, President turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, President captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June President captured the outward-bound Falmouth packet Duke of Montrose, Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before President could send a prize crew aboard. President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of Presidents prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth {{under the command of}} an American officer.

50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>cartels</b> would {{participate}} in other joint ventures in later years, {{such as the}} founding of Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS), who successfully returned Ochoa's kidnapped sister, Marta Nieves Ochoa. Expanding on the prior success of MAS, <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> and independent traffickers would meet again. The second meeting {{is believed to have}} been the start of organization in trafficking between the primary participants, <b>the</b> Medellín <b>Cartel,</b> and Cali <b>Cartel.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>cartels</b> divided up <b>the</b> major United States distribution points, with <b>the</b> Cali <b>Cartel's</b> taking New York City and <b>the</b> Medellín <b>Cartel's</b> taking South Florida and Miami; Los Angeles was left up for grabs. Through their affiliation in MAS, it is also believed <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> decided to work together to stabilize prices, production and shipments of the cocaine market. The strategic alliance formed with the foundation of MAS in 1981 began to crumble by 1983-1984, due to the ease of competition. As <b>the</b> <b>cartels</b> set up infrastructure, routes, transport methods and bribes, it became easier for competition and establish similar deals, or make use of those already in place by other <b>cartels.</b> By 1987, <b>the</b> cooperation forged by the formation of MAS no longer existed. Contributing to the demise was the Medellín Cartels' Rodriguez Gacha, who attempted to move in on the New York City market, previously ceded to <b>the</b> Cali <b>Cartel,</b> and <b>the</b> 1986 arrest of Jorge Ochoa at a police roadblock, an arrest <b>the</b> Medellín <b>Cartel</b> believed was suspicious and which they attributed partly to <b>the</b> Cali <b>Cartel.</b>|$|R

5|$|Given that Moreno González's {{body was}} never {{recovered}} from the December 2010 shootout where officials said he was killed, there were rumors that he was alive and secretly leading the Knights Templar Cartel, the split-off group of La Familia Michoacana. On June 2011, members of La Familia Michoacana set up several public banners throughout the state of Guerrero with written messages directed to the former President Calderón and his security spokesman Alejandro Poiré. The banners proclaimed that Moreno González was in fact alive and leading the Knights Templar Cartel, {{and that the government}} was allegedly covering him up. The rumors were immediately denied by the Mexican government, which stood firm that the drug lord was killed by federal forces on December 9, 2010. Rumors sparked again in October 2011 following the arrest of Mario Buenrostro Quiroz, a drug trafficker who headed a Mexico City-based gang known as Los Aboytes. In a videotaped police confession, he told authorities that Moreno González was still alive and heading <b>the</b> <b>cartel.</b> Intelligence agency InSight Crime said the rumors were probably part of a campaign of the Knights Templar Cartel to win prestige from La Familia Michoacana by saying that their leader is in fact alive and still supporting the group. On 27 October 2012, the Mexican Army raided a safe house in Apatzingán where they believed the drug lord Enrique Plancarte Solís was hiding. Though the raid was ultimately unsuccessful because Plancarte Solís managed to avoid capture by sending several gunmen from his inner circle to battle off the soldiers, the authorities discovered several documents written for Moreno González. The Army gave the documents to the intelligence agency SIEDO for further investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for <b>the</b> <b>cartel.</b> But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Cancún.

After Cartman demonstrates his ruthlessness against a cheating street dealer, Billy sends him and another employee, Tommy, to Corbin, Kentucky to buy chicken directly from Colonel Sanders. Sanders is impressed by Cartman but has Tommy executed after discovering {{him to be a}} mole for healthy foods advocate Jamie Oliver. Cartman wins over the Colonel's trust, but is warned to never betray him. Cartman eventually betrays Billy by telling Billy's mother that he got an F on his social studies test, and takes over <b>the</b> <b>cartel</b> after Billy is grounded. The Colonel assigns Cartman the task of assassinating Oliver to prevent him from giving a speech in the United Nations. However, the gluttonous Cartman soon comes to abuse the KFC food he assigned to sell, and forgets the Colonel's assassination order. The Colonel, furious at Cartman's incompetence, sends a squad of gunmen to kill him, leading to a firefight with the police that kills Billy's mother, and which Cartman escapes unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a disabled state at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in <b>the</b> <b>cartel</b> Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in imitation of the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a noose around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the Batavian Republic Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors.
