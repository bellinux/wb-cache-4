5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then used <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex {{to show how the}} molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
