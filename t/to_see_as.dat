5|$|Johann Lamont {{was born}} in the Anderston {{district}} of Glasgow on 11 July 1957. Her parents, Archie and Effie, were both Gaelic speakers from crofting families on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree, who met after both had moved to Glasgow. Archie was a carpenter employed by the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, working on the Mallaig to Skye route. He took part in the Seamen's Strike of 1966. The family were Presbyterians, and Lamont's mother was influenced in her faith by the American evangelist Billy Graham. Her first experiences of public speakers was listening to the preachers her mother took her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a girl.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, {{his sister}} Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{and moved to}} Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The {{following}} year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch FrederickV, who was leader of the Protestant Union, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown {{in defiance of the}} emperor {{marked the beginning of the}} turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.|$|E

Norris topped multiple opinion polls as the person most Irish people would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> their next president (with the caveat that these polls have been taken before all candidates have declared). Internal research by Fine Gael also placed Norris ahead of all other potential candidates.|$|E
25|$|Allred {{used the}} Pauling method to {{calculate}} separate electronegativities for different oxidation {{states of the}} handful of elements (including tin and lead) for which sufficient data was available. However, for most elements, {{there are not enough}} different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known to make this approach feasible. This is particularly true of the transition elements, where quoted electronegativity values are usually, of necessity, averages over several different oxidation states and where trends in electronegativity are harder <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a result.|$|E

25|$|Sanford Stadium {{is one of}} the few college stadiums, and one of {{only two}} in the Southeastern Conference, in which the {{football}} field is oriented to face east–west as opposed to north–south (the other is Commonwealth Stadium; both stadiums are oriented in a general northwest–southeast direction).

25|$|The hamster tail can be {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>as</b> it is usually not very long (about 1/6 {{the length of the}} body), {{with the exception of the}} Chinese hamster, which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors; they have an upper pair and lower pair which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are very flexible, but their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold.|$|E

25|$|The Sneinton Dragon {{is a large}} {{sculpture}} {{that stands}} at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from stainless steel, it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what they would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a piece of public art to represent their area. It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the Christmas period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There also are three other sculptures in Sneinton.|$|E
25|$|In {{directional}} terms, {{the beam}} was sharp {{enough that the}} edges of the arc were quite strong - the target would appear in the beam and then disappear with little or no difference in brightness at the edges. This meant that in spite of the relatively wide beam, the arcs were quite sharp and even small angles would cause the signals to disappear at some point and create a gap in the return. With targets near the centre this was quite easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the ring would develop a gap, allowing measurements as accurate as about one degree. However, targets further from the centre displayed much shorter arcs, making it more difficult to see small changes in their length.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the game}} uses a white ball {{instead of the}} red one used in {{first-class}} cricket, the ball can become discoloured and hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules {{to help keep the}} ball playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), the same strategy that was used in the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously-used ball. Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball.|$|E
