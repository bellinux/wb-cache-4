25|$|In 2057, the sun {{is dying}} and the Earth is freezing. A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the {{spaceship}} Icarus II, with the intent <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> the sun, and return to Earth. As they slingshot past Mercury, Icarus II discovers the distress beacon of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt their mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs {{have a better chance}} of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four shield panels.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} legislative actions and policies implemented on a federal and state level to both regulate atomic energy and promote its expansion. Growth of nuclear power in the US ended in the 1980s, however the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed in 2005 which aimed <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> the nuclear industry through financial loan-guarantees for expansion and re-outfitting of nuclear plants. The success of this legislation is still undetermined, since all 17 companies that applied for funding are still in the planning phases on their 26 proposed building applications. Some of the proposed sites have even scrapped their building plans, and many think the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster further dampen the success of expansion of nuclear energy in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} four years the three Balkenende {{cabinets}} had implemented an ambitious program of social-economic reforms, including tax cuts, reforms to the social welfare system and investments in education. Their aim was <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> the Dutch economy. Initially there was great public dissatisfaction with this policy, with large demonstrations in 2003, 2004 and 2005 by the main labour union FNV and the three main opposition parties. They criticised the government for taking these measures at the wrong point in time, during a recession, and they claimed that the government made the poor and socially weaker pay for the economic recovery. A major focus of this debate was on the fact that more than 10% of the people were said to live in poverty, as exemplified by the rising number of 'voedselbanken' (give-away shops for food). As the economy began to perform better in 2006 the public dissatisfaction decreased.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of {{hyperinflation}} in the late 1940s when the Kuomintang (KMT) military regime of Chen Yi overprinted the new Taiwan Yuan against the previous Japan Taiwan Yen, {{it became clear that}} a new and stable currency was needed. When the KMT government retreated to Taiwan after the loss of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, it brought part of the precious metal and foreign currency reserve of mainland China to the island. Although war-ravaged China had held only a very small reserve, some $170 million in all, those reserves helped to establish a gold-standard reserve currency in Taiwan, which in turn helped to stabilize prices and reduce hyperinflation. More importantly, many of the Chinese intellectual and business elites moved with KMT to the island. The Japanese had built up the agricultural and industrial infrastructure as well as chemical, material, and food reserves on the island that allowed the elite of the KMT supporters <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> their own economic endeavors. Along with the $4 billion in financial aid and soft credit provided by the US (as well as the indirect economic stimulus of US food and military aid) over the 1945-1965 period, Taiwan had the necessary capital to restart its economy. Further, the KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the band}} taking {{a more serious}} {{approach}} on Benefits, they decided to once more change their name, finally settling on A Wilhelm Scream. Signing with new label Jump Start Records, they re-released Benefits of Thinking Out Loud under their new name. After touring the United States and Canada a few times, they then began recording their next album, Mute Print, with Jump Start. For the recording of the album, the band decided to put [...] "as much shit as you can possibly fit into a song and pull off live" [...] into the songs, to which they attribute their faster, more aggressive and more technical sound. The album was produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, whom the band looked up to. Although the album was finished while the band was signed <b>to</b> <b>Jump</b> <b>Start,</b> {{the rights to the}} album were then bought by Nitro Records, who released it in 2004.|$|E
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: The risk of fatality is greater in jump than in flat racing in Victoria, Australia. This {{is the first}} study to identify risk factors specific <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> in Victoria. Objective: To identify risk factors for fatality of Thoroughbred racehorses in <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> on all racecourses in Victoria, Australia between 1989 and 2004. Methods: Fatalities comprised all horses that died during or immediately after a jump (hurdle or steeplechase) race or official jump trial and all horses that were subjected to euthanasia within 24 h of an event in which an injury was sustained. The retrospective study involved 191 case starts and 2324 control starts. Univariable and multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for fatality at any one start. A multiple level model was used with racecourse included as a random effect. Results: In the final multivariable model, {{the duration of the}} racing career of the horse, the number of flat, hurdle and steeple starts accumulated in the 60 days prior to the case or control start, the number of flat and <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> accumulated over the racing career, if the horse had had a start between 1 and 14 days prior to the case or control start, the type of jump race (hurdle or steeple), the calendar year of the start and the location of the racecourse were associated with fatality. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need to investigate further the differences between hurdle and steeplechase events and the adverse effect of prolonged prior flat racing careers on the risk of fatality in <b>jump</b> <b>starts.</b> Potential relevance: This is the first study to examine risk factors for fatality in <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> in Victoria. The results should shape the development of interventions to reduce the risk in <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> in the future...|$|R
