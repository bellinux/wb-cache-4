40|$|A {{discussion}} of new starting points for better, more proactive station access planning approaches. Station access planning is re-emerging {{as a vital}} component of the overall suite of initiatives needed to make public <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> <b>work</b> effectively. Without proactive access planning and access infrastructure improvement, the overall travel experience for public transport users is invariably diminished, {{and it may be}} that significant ridership potential is also forgone. It is only through a view that supports and enhances the “total journey ” (including access and egress) that transit can compete with private travel alternatives. The paper analyses figures for station access and egress in the BART network (of the San Francisco Bay Area) – and uses these figures to develop station access “typologies ” or “categories”. Interpretation from the figures and the categories is then delivered with a view to informing new efforts in access assessment, planning, design, and infrastructure provision. Advanced station access planning approaches would look at multi-modal and transit transfer questions, but also address pedestrian and bike access elements. But a first step may be to clearly understand actual access/egress usage, in order to then determine how planning and infrastructure development should proceed, based on preferred outcomes.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{business}} travel has increased substantially, with both individual and organizational consequences. Many larger companies and public authorities therefore attempt to implement policies, regulations and standardized routines for their travel. The concept of travel management describes such activities pursued on a professional basis, by employed travel managers. The purpose of this report is to investigate travel management in Sweden and, in particular, to examine business travel by train in relation to professional travel management. The report mainly draws on interviews with travel managers, but empirical data also include interviews with sales personnel at travel agencies and at SJ (the state-owned Swedish railway company), interviews with frequent business travellers, and travel policy documents. To begin with, six important tasks for a travel manager are identified: 1) developing and implementing a travel policy, 2) cooperating with a travel agency, 3) making agreements with suppliers, 4) creating standardized payment routines, 5) collecting and analyzing travel statistics, and 6) communicating and gaining support within the organization. These different tasks are then described and analyzed in some detail, and specific attention is given to how the railway as a <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> {{in relation to the}} practice of travel management.

The problem is global, but must be solved locally. Most of the world’s population lives in cities that act as centres of economic growth and productivity, but which – if they develop in the wrong direction – can cause social inequalities, or irreversibly harm the environment. Urban transport causes a number of negative impacts that can affect sustainability targets.

40|$|Transport {{and supply}} water {{networks}} {{are two types}} of systems which have received a significant amount of attention in the recent years. Issues on how to obtain the best performance for a given transport or supply water systems, or how to coordinate interactions between them are still open and need more research. This chapter presents a hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme with a supervisor that coordinates transport and supply water systems. First, a two-level hierarchical control structure resulting from a functional decomposition of water network is briefly presented. Inside each hierarchy, an MPC controller is used. In the two-level hierarchy, a supervisory coordinating mechanism is used to generate control strategies which consider objectives at different time scales. The first level, in charge of managing the <b>transport</b> <b>system,</b> <b>works</b> in a daily scale in order to achieve the global management policies for the transport over water (e. g., navigation, vessels and barges) in different rivers and balance management of different reservoirs. The second level, in charge of managing the supply <b>system,</b> <b>works</b> in a hourly scale and manipulates actuator (pumps and valves) set-point to satisfy the local water supplying objectives (e. g., minimizing economic cost, handling emergency storage and smoothing actuator operation). The results of the modeling will be applied to the Catalunya Regional Water Network and based on an aggregate model.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in the modelling of a <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> {{is the level of}} detail required in the specification of travel demand models. The problem is all the more significant as the greater the extension and diversity of areas influenced by intervention options is. Common practice typically pursues a mono-scale approach, modelling the entire <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> using a single model, consistent with the territorial scale of the study area and indifferent to any territorial and/or transportation specificities.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the performances of}} a <b>transport</b> <b>system,</b> many <b>works</b> in literature use traffic data (i. e. flow counts) observed on representative links of the transport network) together with transport model. The observed data are the input for the transport model update.

In this paper, we apply a method for calibrating the parameters of cost functions and demand parameters and/or demand update at the same time. The data input are a (initial) demand matrix, the link cost function (i. e., a function for each link set), the model for users choices simulation.

DXD-AAA substitution resulted in loss of binding of UDP-GlcNAc and the ability to inhibit mitogenic stimulation of bovine T cells, without obvious changes to the biophysical properties of the protein. Unlike LCTs, wild-type LifA did not appear to be directly cytotoxic to HeLa or Jurkat cells using a fluorescence-based assay for release of lactate dehydrogenase.
