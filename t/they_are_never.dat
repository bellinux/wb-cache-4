5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, most {{academic}} related {{software development}} projects are short lived experimental projects.

25|$|Some {{proteins}} might specifically interact {{when they}} are co-expressed in the yeast, although in reality <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> present in the same cell at the same time.

25|$|Tidal {{power is}} the most {{predictable}} of all the variable renewable energy sources. Twice a day the tides vary 100%, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> intermittent, on the contrary they are completely reliable.

25|$|Similar {{symptoms}} {{may appear}} months to years after exposure as chronic radiation syndrome when the dose rate {{is too low}} to cause the acute form.

25|$|The {{meaning of}} the chacmool figures varied across time {{depending}} upon the geographical and cultural context. Chacmools {{do not appear to}} have been worshipped, since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> found within inner sanctuary of temples or shrines; it appears to have rather been a piece of religious paraphernalia used by the priesthood {{in the course of their}} duties. Three uses have generally been attributed to chacmools.|$|E

25|$|Because muons have a {{very large}} mass and energy {{compared}} with the decay energy of radioactivity, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> produced by radioactive decay. They are, however, produced in copious amounts in high-energy interactions in normal matter, in certain particle accelerator experiments with hadrons, or naturally in cosmic ray interactions with matter. These interactions usually produce pi mesons initially, which most often decay to muons.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch have {{a code of}} {{etiquette}} which governs {{social behaviour}} and is considered important. Because of the international position of the Netherlands, many books have been written on the subject.

In addition to those specific to the Dutch, many general points of European etiquette apply to the Dutch as well.|$|E
25|$|P. tarminiana is {{distinguished}} from P. tripartita var. mollissima {{by a number}} of features. P. tarminiana has small deciduous stipules while P. tripartita var. mollissima has larger, persistent stipules. The sepals and petals in P. tarminiana are perpendicular to the floral tube or are reflexed, whereas <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> so open in P. tripartita var. mollissima. They are also both much shorter in relation to the length of the floral tube in P. tripartita var. mollissima than in P. tarminiana.|$|E

25|$|Female workers forage to feed {{themselves}} and non-foragers, {{such as the}} queen, larvae, and males. They help to build the nest {{and care for the}} larvae. Workers may mate with males and remain inseminated even if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> able to attain queenship and produce offspring. Worker-worker relatedness is not asymmetrically higher than relatedness between workers and males or workers and the queen. This is because of overlapping matrilines and patrilines within the colony which decreases relatedness overall between individuals.|$|E
25|$|Maundy {{money is}} a {{ceremonial}} coinage traditionally given to the poor, and nowadays awarded annually to deserving senior citizens. There are Maundy coins in denominations of one, two, three and four pence. They bear dates from 1822 to the present and are minted in very small quantities. Though they are legal tender in the UK, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> encountered in circulation. The pre-decimal Maundy pieces have the same legal tender status and value as post-decimal ones, and effectively increased in face value by 140% upon decimalisation. Their numismatic value is much greater.|$|E
25|$|But {{people who}} go to {{pictures}} for the sake of seeing pictures will see a great one. For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>never</b> quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E
