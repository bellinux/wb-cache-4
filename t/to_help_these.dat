5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>these</b> bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{national}} accreditation groups {{attempted to}} disaccredit many of Kentucky's public colleges during Clements administration {{in order to}} end longstanding political interference in the higher education system. Clements worked <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>these</b> colleges maintain their accreditation and to secure re-accreditation for Morehead State Teachers College. In 1948, he weakened Kentucky's Day Law—which enforced segregation of the state's education system—by providing an exception for black medical personnel to take post-graduate courses in white public hospitals. He also supported a 1948 bill that allowed blacks to pursue medical training at the University of Louisville. His efforts to secure a similar arrangement at the University of Kentucky were not successful, despite the governor's status as ex-officio chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1949, the federal district court in Lexington granted blacks admission to programs at the University of Kentucky if an equivalent program was not available at Kentucky State College, the state's historically black college.|$|E
5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>these.</b> Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E

25|$|At one point, local commanders {{decided to}} remove the coastal {{artillery}} from the badly damaged fortress, and the 33rd was asked to help. The guns were removed from their five- to eight-inch bases during daylight hours; later, at night, they were slung beneath a specially built wagon equipped with fourteen-inch-wide tires, to which thirty-six mules were hitched. A lengthy rope was tied to the tongue, and 100 soldiers were tasked with pulling on it <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>these</b> mules haul the cannon across the sandy beach to barges on the bay, which in turn carried them on to Pensacola.
