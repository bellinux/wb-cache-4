40|$|An Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) is an {{electrical}} device that disconnects protected circuit whenever it detects unbalance current between the phase conductor and the neutral conductor. Such an unbalance is sometimes caused by current leakage {{through the body}} of a person who is grounded when accidentally touching the energized part of the circuit. A lethal shock can result from these conditions. ELCB are designed to disconnect this fault fast enough to mitigate the harm caused by such shocks. Currently, there is no Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) with auto re-closer features in the market. The current ELCB that available in the market is a manual type and cannot differentiate between temporary disturbances and permanent faults. It’s means that, if a disturbance or fault occurs on the protected area (house or shop), the protection system will force ELCB to trip. One of the drawbacks of the common ELCB is that, it’s can’t <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> supply back to the normal operation condition although only a short disturbance occurs. Such disturbance is lightning strike on the transmission line in the distribution site near to the protected area. To turn the power back to normal operation, consumers need to do that manually. To overcome this problem, Auto Re-closer Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (AR-ELCB) has been developed. This thesis presents the development of AR-ELCB. This device was designed to differentiate between permanent fault and short disturbances (lightning) ...|$|E

40|$|Permanent magnet {{brushless}} DC motors (PMBLDC) find wide {{applications in}} industries {{due to their}} high power density and ease of control. These motors are generally controlled using a three phase power semiconductor bridge. For starting and the providing proper commutation sequence to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> devices in the inverter bridge the rotor position sensors required. Based on the rotor position, the power devices are commutated sequentially every 60 degrees. To achieve desired level of performance the motor requires suitable speed controllers. In case of permanent magnet motors, usually speed control is achieved by using proportional-integral(PI) controller. Although conventional PI controllers are widely used in the industry due to their simple control structure and ease of implementation, these controllers pose difficulties where there are some control complexity such as nonlinearity, load disturbances and parametric variations. Moreover PI controllers require precise linear mathematical models. This thesis presents a Fuzzy Logic Controller(FLC) for speed control of a BLDC by using. The Fuzzy Logic(FL) approach applied to speed control leads to an improved dynamic behavior of the motor drive system and an immune to load perturbations and parameter variations. The FLC is designed using based on a simple analogy between the control surfaces of the FLC and a given Proportional-Integral controller(PIC) for the same application. Fuzzy logic control offers an improvement {{in the quality of}} the speed response, compared to PI control. This work focuses on investigation and evaluation of the performance of a permanent magnet brushless DC motor (PMBLDC) drive, controlled by PI, and Fuzzy logic speed controllers. The Controllers are for the PMBLDC motor drive simulated using MATLAB soft ware package. Further, the PI controller has been implemented on an experimental BLDC motor set up...|$|E
40|$|Author: Gary Brown ### Day 0 One frozen vial of Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) is thawed {{quickly in}} a 37 oC water bath. When {{the last bit}} of ice is melted, spray the vial with 70 % ethanol and {{transfer}} the contents of the vial into one 75 cm 2 flask (T- 75) containing 20 ml of MEF media. Place the MEFs in a 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, 86 % humidity incubator. Every frozen MEF preparation thaws a little differently. If on Day 1, the MEFs are only 50 % cconfluent, thaw another vial into your ongoing T- 75 MEF flask. It is important for the MEFs to be maintained at a relatively high density, or they will not continue to expand. ### Day 2 MEF passage 1 : Expand the MEFs as follows: The MEFs should be 90 % confluent (if they are not, feed them another day). Split as follows: Suction off old media, rinse flask x 1 with 10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 5 ml Trypsin/EDTA media (0. 05 %/ 0. 02 %) to the flask and incubate for 5 to 10 minutes at 37 oC. After 10 minutes, the cells should be detached from the bottom. Now add 10 ml MEF media to this flask, pipette up and down to disaggregate the cells into a single cell suspension, and add the entire contents of the flask into one 150 cm 2 flask (T- 150). Add 20 ml MEF media to the flask, so that the final volume is 30 to 35 ml. Incubate at 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, 86 % humidity. ### Day 4 You should now have 1 T- 150 flask of confluent MEF cells. MEF passage 2 : Mitotically inactivate cells as follows: Rinse with PBS (10 ml) and harvest with 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA for 10 minutes at 37 oC as above. Add 10 ml of MEF media and pipette cells up and down several times. Take 10 ml of cells from the flask and put in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Refeed the T- 150 ml flask with 25 ml of fresh media. To the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the MEF cells, add 5 ml MEF media (bringing the final volume up to 15 ml). Take this tube to the blood bank and irradiate (3000 rads). These inactivated MEFs will be used to make two 10 cm dishes of MEF feeder layers for your ES cell thaw on Sunday. Using a hemacytometer, count the MEFs before adding them to your dish. A good monolayer will be formed if you add approximately 1 x 106 MEF cells to each 10 cm dish. Plate inactivated MEFs in 2 - 10 cm dishes having a final concentration of 1 x 106 Mef's per dish and a final volume of 12. 0 ml. We prepare 1 extra 10 cm dish in case of contamination or poor monolayer. ### Sunday, Day 5 Thaw ES cells as follows: Suction the existing MEF media off one of the inactivated MEF 10 cm dishes. Refeed the dish with 12 ml ES media. Thaw one frozen vial of RW 4 cells (1 x 106 cells) in a 37 oC waterbath. When {{the last bit of}} ice has melted, spray the tube with 70 % ethanol and transfer the contents of the vial to the inactivated MEF dish. Rock the dish to evenly disperse the cells. Incubate overnight at 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, and 86 % humidity. The T- 150 flask of ongoing MEFs is ready to be expanded today. Rinse with PBS, add 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA, for 10 minutes, then add 10 ml of MEF media, and pipette up and down several times. Pipette 8 ml of these cells into a new T- 150 flask containing 25 mls of MEF media. Refeed the existing T- 150 with 25 ml MEF media to create 2 T- 150 's of expanding MEFs. ### Day 6 Feed the ES cells with 12 ml ES media. Approximately 60 % of the ES cells will form colonies in the dish. They are football shaped, shiny, and plump. You will need 4 x 10 cm dishes of irradiated MEFs for your electroporation on Day 7. You have 2 T- 150 's ongoing from which to make these 4 dishes. Follow the procedure for mitotically inactivating MEFs on Day 4. However, use both T- 150 s this time. Don't forget to refeed them, or you will not have MEFs {{for the end of the}} week. If the 2 T- 150 flasks of MEF cells are not confluent today, feed them, and then inactivate them on the morning of Day 7. If you inactivate your MEFs on Day 7, you must either give them 2 to 3 hours to attach before changing the MEF media to ES media or initially inactivate and plate them in ES media. ### Day 7 **Electroporation**: Use three of the 10 cm dishes of inactivated MEF cells prepared on Day 6. From each dish, remove the old media and add 10 ml of fresh ES media. Place these dishes back in the incubator. Next, take the 10 cm dish containing the MEFs and ES cells and remove the old media. Rinse the dish x 1 with PBS, then add 2 ml Trypsin/EDTA and incubate for 5 - 10 minutes at 37 oC. After 5 minutes, the cells will look like "bunches of grapes" under the inverted scope. Add 2 ml more Trypsin/EDTA to the dish, pipette up and down to break up the clumps and incubate for 3 more minutes. [You must have single cells for the electroporation. ] Look at the cells again under the inverted microscope. The MEFs are the larger cells, and the ES cells are small and shiny; most if not all should now be single cells. To the 10 cm dish add 7 ml ES media, pipette up and down, and transfer all the cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Pellet the cells by centrifuging gently (1000 RPM in a Sorvall tabletop) for 5 minutes at 10 oC. Take off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1. 0 ml ice cold 1 x Hebs (see Reagents, Transfection Buffer 1 X Hebs). Prepare a 5 ml tube of ES media for the cells after electroporation. Get out a sterile "flat pack" 1. 8 mm gap cuvette (BTX order # 485) and insert the cuvette between the safety stand contacts. Make sure there is a good contact between the cuvette and the safety stand contact. Having the safety stand connected to the rear of the unit using the cables supplied, <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> switch. Set electroporator (BTX 600 or equivalent) as follows: 500 V/Capacitance and resistance, 500 uF capacitance timing, 360 ohms R 8 Resistance timing, Charging voltage 185 V. Pipette the ES cells up and down with a 5 ml pipette and add to a microfuge tube containing the targeting construct DNA (40 ug of clean linear DNA in 1 X TE @ 1 ug/ul for each electroporation). Pipette cells and construct up and down with a pasteur pipette carefully. Slowly add the cells to the cuvette, taking care not to introduce any bubbles. Slide the cuvette into the electroporation chamber, dial the charging voltage to 185 V and push the pulse button. Wait until the charging is over, then push the reset button, dial down the voltage, and turn the power off. With a sterile pasteur pipette, take the electroporated cells out of the cuvette and place them into the 5. 0 ml of fresh ES media in a centrifuge tube (final vol. = 6 ml total). Take the three 10 cm dishes of inactivated MEFs (freshly fed with ES media) and add 2 ml of the transfected ES cells per dish. Label the dishes with the targeting construct's name and date. Rock the dishes slowly to evenly disperse cells. **Alternate Electroporation Procedure using Safety Chamber 630 A, BTX cuvette, 2 mm gap**: Prepare a 5. 2 ml. tube of ES media for cells after the electroporation. Prepare ES cells for electroporation as described in original text on Day 7, except add only 800 ul cold 1 X Hebs to your pelleted cells. Place a sterile BTX cuvette (2 mm gap) in a 630 A Safety Chamber and attach the electrodes securely to the Electro Cell Manipulator 600. Pipette the cells up and down with a 5 ml pipette, and add 800 ul of cells to a microfuge tube containing the targeting construct (40 ug of clean linear DNA in 1 X TE @ 1 ug/ul for each electroporation). Mix the cells and DNA with a 200 - 1000 ul barrier tip trying not to create bubbles. Add 400 ul of the cell/DNA mixture to a BTX cuvette. Set Electroporator as follows: 500 Vcapacitance and resistance, 500 uF capacitance timing, 360 ohms R 8 Resistance timing, Charging Voltage 160 V. When capacitors are charged hit the pulse button. When charging is complete, with the pipette provided, harvest the electroporated cells and place them into 5. 2 ml of fresh ES media. Repeat the electroporation with the other 400 ul cells/construct in a new BTX cuvette. Add this to the 5. 2 ml yielding a final volume of 6. 0 ml. Take the 3 - 10 cm. dishes containing inactivated MEFs freshly fed with ES media and add 2 ml. of the electroporated cells per dish. Rock the dishes slowly to evenly disperse the cells. Label the dishes and place in the incubator. ### Day 9 Feed the transfected ES cells with Selection Media, 13 ml dish. The clones should now be fairly large. ### Day 10 Feed transfected ES cells with Selection Media as above. You should begin to see some selection in your dishes. Dead cells should be suspended in the media above your ES clones. Using your ongoing T- 150 MEF flasks (2 flasks), you will prepare five, 24 well dishes for the isolation and expansion of your individual clones on Day 13. MEF passage 3 : split ongoing MEFs (90 % confluent) and irradiate as follows: Take off the old media and rinse x 1 with PBS (10 ml). Add 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA and incubate 5 to 10 minutes at 37 oC. Add 10 ml MEF media, and pipette up and down. Transfer all of the MEF cells to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat with the other flask of MEFs. If you wish to keep an ongoing flask of MEF cells at this time, you may leave 5 ml. of cells in one of the flasks and refeed this flask. However after preparing your 24 well dishes today you will not need MEFs again for the completion of this electroporation. Take the MEF cells in the centrifuge tube and irradiate the cells as before (3000 rads) at the blood bank. Using a hemacytometer, count your MEFs. You will need 7 x 10 e 4 MEFs per well. To attain this, you should add 9 x 10 e 6 irradiated cells in a final volume of 125 ml. MEF media into a sterile plastic bottle. Now you will have enough cells to prepare 5 - 24 well dishes. Mix the cells gently so that they are evenly dispersed and add 1. 0 ml of irradiated MEFs to each well of a 24 well dish in a total of 5 dishes. Incubate at 37 oC until Day 13. ### Day 11 / 12 Feed transfected ES cells with 12 ml of Selection Media (G 418). This may be done on Day 11 or Day 12., but does not have to be done both days. ### Day 13 View the 10 cm dishes containing the transfected ES cells through the inverted microscope. The clones are visible as small nests of rapidly growing cells. They have tight borders and are closely packed. Larger cells within the colony, with well defined membranes are the cells which are beginning to differentiate. Do not pick these clones! This is day 6 of the selection process. If the clones are big enough you may pick on this day, or wait until day 7. To pick the clones, you must view them through an inverted microscope in a laminar flow hood. Prepare your 24 well plates (made on Day 10) by taking out the old media and replacing it with 1. 0 ml ES Selection Media per well. Place the 24 well dishes (all 5) back into the incubator. Replace the ES selection media in the first 10 cm dish with fresh ES Selection Media. Place the dish under the microscope and view the cells at 4 X and 10 X trying to be sure you are picking clones that have not yet started to differentiate. Isolate the clone that you wish to pick in the viewing field. Using a 0 - 160 ul barrier tip, gently push the ES clone forward from the surrounding MEFs. With the pipettor set between 30 and 50 ul, and the plunger button already depressed, pluck the clone using a forward scooping suction motion. If the pipettor is set on 30 ul, you should have enough suction to dislodge the clone from the plate. However, if the inactivated MEF layer is too dense, you may have trouble dislodging the ES clones. In this case, you must carefully tease the surrounding MEFs away from the clone without disrupting the clone with your tip. Then you should be able to harvest your clones as above. Place each clone into one of the 24 wells containing ES Selection Media. Continue to pick clones and place in the wells of the prepared 24 well plate until 12 clones are picked or the 10 cm. dish has been out of the incubator for 15 minutes (the clones are sensitive to pH and temperature changes). Now place the plate containing the picked clones in the incubator. Continue picking clones until all 24 wells have been filled in all of your prepared dishes. Leave the 24 well dishes in the incubator overnight. ### Day 14 If you were not able to pick all your clones on day 13, you may continue to pick today (selection day 7). Picking on Day 8 of selection is NOT recommended. ### Day 14 / 15 Examine the 24 well plates under the scope. You should see a single clone in each well. To disaggregate each clone, hold the dish at an angle and suction out the media. Now add 0. 5 ml PBS to each well to rinse out the media and resuction each well. Next add 0. 2 ml. Trypsin/EDTA to each well and place the plate back in the incubator for 20 minutes at 37 oC. Finally add 1. 0 ml ES selection media to each well and pipette the cells up and down 4 or 5 times with a 200 ul to 1000 ul barrier tip to disaggregate the clone. After all clones are disaggregated, return your 24 well plate to the incubator. Look at your plates every day. You want your wells to have many small nests of colonies, evenly dispersed throughout the well. *Note: ES selection media should be used until the clones are frozen to ensure that no Wild Type ES cells contaminate your clones*. ### Day 15 / 16 Examine the clones with the inverted scope. They will look like many tiny clones of ES cells, evenly dispersed. Aspirate the existing media from the cells, then feed all your wells with 1. 0 ml ES selection media. ### Day 16 / 17 The individual wells of the 24 -well plate should contain 50 to 100 small, healthy, undifferentiated colonies if they were properly disaggregated. Number your wells from 1 to 120. To freeze the individual clones, first rinse each well with 0. 5 ml PBS, and then add 0. 2 ml 0. 05 % Trypsin/EDTA to each well. Place the plate in the incubator for 15 minutes. Remove the plate from the incubator and add 0. 5 ml ES media to each well. Individually disaggregate the cells with a 200 to 1000 ul barrier tip by pipetting up and down 4 to 5 times. Place 500 ul of the disaggregated colonies in the Nunc vial (1. 8 ml) that is numbered the same as your well. Add 0. 5 ml. of 2 X ES freezing media to each vial. Place the numbered cryotubes in a freezer box labeled with your constructs name and put in a - 70 o freezer. After removing all the colonies to the cryotubes, refeed each well of the 24 well plate with 1. 0 ml ES media. Allow the cells in these wells to grow to confluence (which will take 4 - 6 days) and use these wells to harvest cells for DNA analysis of the clones. Repeat this freezing procedure for all of your plates. When the DNA analysis confirms which numbered vials are homologous recombinants, these vials are then stored under liquid nitrogen for later expansion and injection. If all of your wells were not ready to be frozen by Day 17, you may need to disaggregate these wells again with Trypsin / EDTA. This will enable a well containing a small number of cells to be expanded further for a subsequent freeze on Day 19. Follow the freezing procedure above on Day 19 for these wells...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A printed ultra-wideband (UWB) {{monopole}} antenna with both tunable and switchable band-notched characteristics is proposed. An embedded resonant slot loaded with a varactor and a pin diode controlled by DC signal through one common bias network is employed to tune and switch the notch band. In the “all-pass ” state {{when the two}} diodes are partially <b>turned</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> consumption of this active antenna is only 2. 4 µW. Measured return loss, radiation pattern, gain and group delay of the introduced antenna are presented in this paper. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Dr. Krick's house, the player discovers {{the front door}} locked, darkness inside, and silence. After <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> and entering, <b>the</b> Player finds Amanda in her crib, alone. Once the Player has explored the house, a snap is heard, and Amanda begins crying. When the Player enters her room, the [...] "Dark Being", described in Dr. Krick's journal, takes Amanda, and jumps through a portal. At this point, the Player can either follow him through or use Dr. Krick's laboratory to construct their own portal. Either way, the Player ends up on a rocky beach in a parallel world. Krick's notes on this make reference to the real physical concept of Godel's universe.|$|R
40|$|Power gating {{is a very}} {{effective}} technique to reduce the subthreshold leakage by using sleep transistors {{to turn off the}} functional blocks or cells when they are not used. When the sleep transistors are <b>turned</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> grid may experience a huge current surge which may violate the integrity of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> grid. This paper addresses this problem by formulating the wakeup scheduling of sleep transistors as an exact mixed integer linear program (MILP). Since the resulting MILP is ��hard, we propose a very efficient yet near optimal algorithm by successively relaxing the MILP to a sequence of linear program (LP) problems. <b>The</b> results obtained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ISCAS benchmarks indicate that our proposed algorithm obtains a near optimal solution with a speedup of 15 × on average compared to the MILP. The proposed algorithm has a runtime complexity which is linear in practice...|$|R

In 1890 Wrixon went to London to represent the Victorian government in the Ah Toy case, which <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of <b>the</b> colonies to refuse to admit aliens. He had argued the case before the Victorian full court when five judges decided against the government, with Higinbotham and Kerford dissenting. Wrixon succeeded in getting the judgment reversed by the privy council. In 1890 he became a Q.C., and in November of that year resigned with {{his colleagues in the}} Gillies government. In 1891 {{he was one of the}} Victorian representatives at the federal convention held at Sydney. There his speech <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth bill was [...] "specially remarkable for the almost prophetic insight into the modifications that would be necessary before the bill could be wholly acceptable" [...] (Quick and Garran, The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, p. 136).|$|R
