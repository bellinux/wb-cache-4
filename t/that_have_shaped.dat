5|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} of complex earth {{movements}} <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The city of Gyeongju was {{united with}} the nearby rural Gyeongju County in 1995 {{and is now}} an urban–rural complex. It is similar to 53 other small- and {{medium-sized}} cities with a population under 300,000 people in South Korea. As well as its rich historical heritage, Gyeongju today {{is affected by the}} economic, demographic, and social trends <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> modern South Korean culture. Tourism remains the major economic driver, but manufacturing activities have developed due to its proximity to major industrial centers such as Ulsan and Pohang. Gyeongju is connected to the nationwide rail and highway networks, which facilitate industrial and tourist traffic.|$|E
5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1998. In 2006, it ranked 17th on Christianity Todays list of fifty books <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> Evangelicals the most. In a Publishers Weekly review, Henry Carrigan notes an anecdotal style {{that can be}} {{frustrating}} but ultimately worth reading. For the Presbyterian Record, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway writes that he found the book refreshing and inspirational. What's So Amazing About Grace? has been endorsed {{by a number of}} public figures, including Irish musician Bono, British adventurer Debra Searle, and World Vision Australia CEO Tim Costello.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{glycosylation}} {{needs to}} be understood by the likely evolutionary selection pressures <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> it. In one model, diversification can be considered purely {{as a result of}} endogenous functionality (such as cell trafficking). However, {{it is more likely that}} diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. Helicobacter attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and that diversity within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.|$|E
25|$|Geology {{describes}} {{the structure of}} the Earth beneath its surface, and the processes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> that structure. It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the histories of those rocks. By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past climates.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Canada has {{reflected}} the multi-cultural influences <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the country. Indigenous, the French, and the British have all made historical {{contributions to the}} musical heritage of Canada. The country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles since the mid-1600s. From the 17th century onward, Canada has developed a music infrastructure that includes church halls; chamber halls; conservatories; academies; performing arts centres; record companys; radio stations, and television music-video channels. The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture because of its proximity and migration between the two countries. Canadian rock has had a considerable impact {{on the development of}} modern popular music and the development of the most popular subgenres.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his support}} among {{elements}} of the party, Zuma remained a powerful political figure, retaining a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal as the country's deputy president. A panel of political analysts convened in November 2005 agreed {{that if he was}} to be found innocent of the corruption charges brought against him, {{it would be hard for}} any other potential ANC candidate to beat Zuma in the race for the country's presidency in 2009. However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a left-wing candidate of the sort that many of his supporters seem to seek, and noted that the global and national economic constraints <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> Mbeki's presidency would be no different in the next presidential term.|$|E
25|$|Downtown can be {{recognized}} by its numerous skyscrapers. Some of these structures, such as the Calgary Tower and the Scotiabank Saddledome are unique enough to be symbols of Calgary. Office buildings tend to concentrate within the commercial core, while residential towers occur most frequently within the Downtown West End and the Beltline, south of downtown. These buildings are iconographic of the city's booms and busts, and {{it is easy to}} recognize the various phases of development <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the image of downtown. The first skyscraper building boom occurred during the late 1950s and continued through to the 1970s. After 1980, during the recession, many high-rise construction projects were immediately halted. It was not until the late 1980s and through to the early 1990s that major construction began again, initiated by the 1988 Winter Olympics and stimulated by the growing economy.|$|E
25|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} {{of a wide variety of}} tectonic {{processes}} <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> Anatolia over millions of years and continue today as evidenced by frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. Except for a relatively small portion of its territory along the Syrian border that is a continuation of the Arabian Platform, Turkey geologically is part of the great Alpide belt that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalaya Mountains. This belt was formed during the Paleogene Period, as the Arabian, African, and Indian continental plates began to collide with the Eurasian plate. This process is still at work today as the African Plate converges with the Eurasian Plate and the Anatolian Plate escapes towards the west and southwest along strike-slip faults. These are the North Anatolian Fault Zone, which forms the present day plate boundary of Eurasia near the Black Sea coast, and the East Anatolian Fault Zone, which forms part of the boundary of the North Arabian Plate in the southeast. As a result, Turkey lies on one of the world's seismically most active regions.|$|E

25|$|Three of {{the four}} Bs <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> Chesham's history relate to its industries. Brush making was {{introduced}} around 1829 {{to make use of}} the off-cuts from woodworking. Boot and shoe making which started as a cottage industry later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of tanneries around 1792 which also supplied leather for saddle making and glove. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. Beer brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century. These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality teddy bears. The works finally closed in 1960. Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue (Industrial Adhesives) to aluminium-based packaging (Alcan), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and balloons (B-Loony).|$|E
500|$|The geology of the {{northern}} Selkirks reveals the tremendous tectonic changes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the terrain of western North America. [...] Like much of British Columbia, the region was first studied by the prolific surveyor and geologist Dr. George Mercer Dawson in 1890. [...] Topographical maps were first produced by A.O. Wheeler in the early 1900s, and in the 1970s, Wheeler's grandson, Dr. John Wheeler, conducted an extensive geological survey from land and air.|$|E
500|$|Being {{distant from}} the Sun and major planets, Kuiper belt objects {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} unaffected by the processes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> and altered other Solar System objects; thus, determining their composition would provide substantial information on the makeup of the earliest Solar System. Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy. When an object's light is broken into its component colors, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object's full spectral [...] "fingerprint", astronomers can determine its composition.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the revised and updated 2003 edition of the book, Law Library Journal wrote, [...] "Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age is a book that can help the uninitiated become {{familiar}} with the issues and arguments <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the debate over regulating cyberspace." [...] The review noted, [...] "Cyber Rights was inspired by Godwin's unwavering belief that an uncensored Internet can transform society into a true democracy. It is an exceptionally personal work and resembles an online journal. ... The book, written in the first person, has a casual and conversational style. As the reader is able to 'hear' the author's voice, Cyber Rights is extremely easy to read." [...] Law Library Journal criticized the book for being repetitive, and for dismissing arguments of his opponents as [...] "an irrational fear of the unknown (i.e., cyberspace) or as a poor understanding of case law or the Framers' intent". The review acknowledged, [...] "Cyber Rights is a good introduction to the world of cyberspace and the legal issues that affect the Internet. It presents, in a readable style, a passionate perspective on an emerging area of law." [...] Law Library Journal recommended the book for [...] "large academic law libraries".|$|E
500|$|The journal, which {{switches}} {{between the}} first-person singular and plural but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in Calais {{and proceeds to}} Paris, they decide on a plan: [...] "After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England {{we could not have}} put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: the French are far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the environment. Some of what they see is beautiful and some is [...] "barren and wretched". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem—the group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches Lucerne, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the Rhine, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see some beautiful scenery before landing in England.|$|E
500|$|Her {{greatest}} mainstream success, however, {{was to come}} in 1978 {{with the}} publication of her fourth novel, Tirra Lirra by the River. The title is a quote from Tennyson's great ballad, [...] "The Lady of Shalott", which tells the tale of a female artist who meets a tragic end when she attempts to move beyond artistic isolation. The novel details the life of Nora Porteous, whose natural creativity is constrained by the fact that [...] "she herself doesn't know that she's an artist. She struggles through, trying to arrive at her art and never succeeding." [...] After thirty odd years away, Nora, now elderly, returns to Brisbane, where she spent her childhood. The novel is essentially a [...] "personally commentated replay of a life," [...] during which Nora recounts and reflects upon the events <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the course of her life. Anderson chose to create a woman from a very specific era: born several decades before Anderson herself was alive, Nora would have lived through World War I, World War II and The Great Depression, in a time and pace where [...] "artists, although they were known to exist, were supposed to exist elsewhere." [...] Nora struggles to submerge her various artistic and unconventional selves in favour of a more socially acceptable constructed persona. Nora uses the [...] "spinning globe," [...] her equivalent of the Lady of Shalott's [...] "crystal mirror," [...] to explore the various stages and facets of her life, and to conceal some of its more unsavoury aspects from herself, and from the reader.|$|E
