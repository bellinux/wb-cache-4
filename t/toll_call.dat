25|$|Part of the {{objective}} behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages {{would be sent to}} one or more hubs or hosts in compressed form (ARC was nominally standard, but PKZIP is universally supported); one <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution.|$|E
5000|$|HXG Delivery by mail or {{landline}} <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> not required. If <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> {{or other}} expense involved, cancel message and send service message back to originating station.|$|E
50|$|Any {{operator}} assistance or <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> billing for these unattended stations was handled remotely at a larger exchange in the city.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-pay {{telephone}} {{cards or}} [...] "calling cards" [...] {{are also very}} vulnerable to fraudulent use; these cards contain a number or passcode which can be dialed in order to bill worldwide <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> to the card. Anyone who obtains the passcode can dishonestly misuse it to make or to resell <b>toll</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calls {{within each}} area, {{up to about}} 12 miles, are local calls. In {{metropolitan}} areas, calls between 13 and 16 miles are Zone Usage Measurement (ZUM) Zone 3 calls. All other calls within each Service Area are now referred to as Local <b>Toll</b> <b>calls.</b> In non-ZUM areas Local <b>Toll</b> <b>calls</b> start at 13 miles.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Montgomery County {{created the}} Montgomery County Transportation Program (MCTP) to oversee various pass through <b>toll,</b> <b>called</b> a shadow <b>toll</b> in other countries, {{financing}} {{projects for the}} state of Texas, located within Montgomery County.|$|R
50|$|Though usually {{toll-free}} when dialled {{from the}} US, not all 1-800 phone numbers are toll-free when dialled from Trinidad and Tobago, {{and may be}} treated as a <b>toll</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} {{regional}} area codes in use for landline calls, For example, a domestic <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> destined for a South Island location requires the dial prefix '03', being domestic-long-distance + 3 for the South Island.|$|E
50|$|MF {{signalling}} tones were {{vulnerable to}} being spoofed using blue boxes which generated a 2600 hertz tone to disconnect a <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> in progress and provided an operator-style MF keypad to dial another call {{using the same}} trunk.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{equipment}} is used {{not only to}} keep billing records of <b>toll</b> <b>calls,</b> but also [...] "to keep a record of all calls dialed from a telephone which is subject to a special rate structure." ...|$|R
5000|$|Numerous complex {{dialling}} instructions {{appeared in}} the front of telephone books explaining the number sequences needed to dial subscribers in local [...] "free calling" [...] areas, and in a few cases for short distance <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> (usually to the local city or town), which were recorded on manually read meters in some step-by-step local exchanges. Local calls were [...] "free", and still are for residential customers. Long distance or <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> required the manual intervention of an operator, who had access to toll circuits, either via an operator's cord board or a toll exchange (switch). Access to the toll operator was by dialling 0.|$|R
50|$|Slingshot {{was founded}} in 1996 by Malcolm Dick and Annette Presley. The company was {{established}} {{as part of the}} CallPlus group of companies to provide residential customers with high quality and affordable internet and <b>toll</b> <b>calling</b> services.|$|R
50|$|A {{domestic}} call within Montserrat {{is seven}} digits. A call from another North American Numbering Plan country (such as the United States or Canada) requires 1-664- and the seven-digit phone number, {{in the same}} format as a domestic <b>toll</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though usually {{toll-free}} when dialled {{from the}} US, not all 1-800, 1-888, 1-877, or 1-866 are toll-free when being dialled from Barbados, {{and may be}} treated as a <b>toll</b> <b>call.</b> If the number is not toll-free a recording will give directions of how to place a fee based call.|$|E
50|$|Automatic number {{identification}} (ANI) is {{a feature}} of a telecommunications network for automatically determining the origination telephone number on toll calls for billing purposes. Automatic number identification was originally created by AT&T Corporation for internal long distance charging purposes, {{eliminating the need for}} telephone operators to manually request the number of the calling party for a <b>toll</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{under the}} purview of the Bell System, local {{telephone}} calls were typically unmetered and included in flat rate billing. The term <b>toll</b> <b>calling</b> was adopted for long distance calls which were subject to toll charges.|$|R
50|$|Most areas permit local {{calls as}} 1+10D except for Texas, Georgia, and some jurisdictions in Canada which require that {{landline}} callers know which numbers are local {{and which are}} toll, dialing 10D for local calls and 1+10D for all <b>toll</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{telephone}} {{was installed}} in 1885 in the K.C. Sanborn Drug Store, the phone {{was connected to the}} Dover Telephone Exchange. By the early 1900s there were 1200 local <b>calls</b> and 400 <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> a day made from Rochester.|$|R
50|$|As direct {{distance}} dialing {{expanded to}} {{a growing number of}} communities, local numbers (often four, five or six digits) were extended to standardized seven-digit named exchanges. A <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> to another area code was eleven digits, including the leading 1. In the 1950s, AT&T conducted extensive studies of product engineering and efficiency and concluded that push-button dialing was preferable to rotary dialing.|$|E
50|$|In {{small towns}} {{with a single}} central office, local calls {{typically}} required dialing only four or five-digits at most, without using named exchanges. A <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> required the assistance of an operator, who asked {{for the name of}} the town and the local station number. Some independent telephone companies, not part of the Bell System, also did not implement central office names.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} digits dialed is {{unrelated}} {{to being a}} local call or a <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> {{when there is no}} toll alerting. Allowing 7D local dial across an area code boundary, which is uncommon today, requires central office code protection, locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the FidoNet {{structure}} {{allows for}} any node to connect directly to any other, and node operators would sometimes {{form their own}} toll-calling arrangements on an ad-hoc basis, allowing for a balance between collective cost saving and timely delivery. For instance, if one node operator in a network offered to make regular <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> to a particular system elsewhere, other operators might arrange to forward all of their mail destined for the remote system, and those near it, to the local volunteer. Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, {{but it was also}} common for people to volunteer to pay for regular <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> either out of generosity, or to build their status in the community.|$|R
50|$|The road <b>toll</b> (<b>called</b> Salik), was re-introduced on the Al Maktoum Bridge on 9 September 2008 {{for both}} directions. The toll {{will not be}} charged when the Floating Bridge is closed (from 10pm to 6am from Saturday to Thursday and from 10pm to 9am on Friday).|$|R
50|$|Dialing plans {{vary from}} place to place {{depending}} on whether an area has overlays (multiple area codes serving the same area) and whether the state requires toll alerting (a leading 1+ for <b>toll</b> <b>calls).</b> The NANPA web site includes dialing plan information in their information on individual area codes.|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{objective}} behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages {{would be sent to}} one or more hubs or hosts in compressed form (ARC was nominally standard, but PKZIP is universally supported); one <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution.|$|E
5000|$|Often, {{a suburb}} of a large city is a <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> from many {{suburban}} exchanges {{on the opposite side}} of the same city, even though all of these suburbs are a local call to the city centre. A business located in such a suburb may therefore benefit from obtaining a downtown number as an [...] "extender", to be permanently forwarded to their geographic suburban number.|$|E
50|$|Before direct {{distance}} dialing (DDD) all long-distance {{calls were}} established by special switchboard operators (long-distance operators) even in exchanges where calls within the local exchange were dialed directly. Completion of long-distance calls was time-consuming and costly as each call was handled by multiple operators in multiple cities. Record keeping was also more complex, as the duration of every <b>toll</b> <b>call</b> had to be manually recorded for billing purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Local Access and Transport Areas (LATA) {{were created}} after {{the breakup of}} the Bell System. They are {{sometimes}} called service areas, or local <b>toll</b> <b>calling</b> areas. California, for example, is divided into 11 service areas. Calls made to places within the same service area break down as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{areas with}} overlays, local calls are all dialed as either 10D or 1+10D; this varies by area. (In New York City, the {{preferred}} form is 1+10D but 10D also works.) In areas without <b>toll</b> alerting, all <b>calls</b> to numbers within the caller's area code and overlay codes serving {{the same area}} can be dialed as either 10D or 1+10D, while calls to other area codes must be 1+10D. In areas with toll alerting, all <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> must be dialed as 1+10D.|$|R
50|$|BI/TAS {{stands for}} Bill Inquiry/Toll Adjustment System. It was a client/server {{application}} in use to create adjustments for disputed long-distance telephone <b>toll</b> <b>calls.</b> It {{was written for}} Commonwealth Telephone of Pennsylvania by Alltel Information Services. With the acquisition of Commonwealth Telephone by Frontier Communications, the application will be retired in favour of an alternative method.|$|R
50|$|As {{telephone}} exchanges converted to automatic (dial) service, switchboards continued to serve specialized purposes. Before {{the advent of}} direct-dialed long distance calls, a subscriber would need to contact the long-distance operator in order to place a <b>toll</b> <b>call.</b> In large cities, there was often a special number, such as 112, which would ring the long-distance operator directly. Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.|$|E
50|$|Subscriber toll {{dialling}} (STD) {{was introduced}} into New Zealand telephone {{network in the}} mid 1970s, {{a result of the}} introduction of NEC crossbar based toll exchanges and their ability to perform number translation. One still needed to dial 0 to make a <b>toll</b> <b>call,</b> but instead of calling the operator, one could then dial the STD number directly. Access to the operator was via 010, while other service numbers remained unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|A local {{exchange}} carrier is a carrier of telephone calls and {{other communication services}} carried by telephone lines. A {{local exchange}} is generally either an exchange within one's own LATA or in an immediately adjacent LATA. A call that is neither local nor long distance is called a local <b>toll</b> <b>call.</b> A local exchange carrier normally sells package deals that include local and local toll calls. Local calls are customarily billed in by the call, or in blocks of calls. Residential local exchange carrier service typically charges , where [...] is the monthly minimum and covers the first [...] calls, [...] is the price per local call, and [...] is the total quantity of calls consumed. Local toll calls are each billed at , where [...] is minimum charge for a local <b>toll</b> <b>call,</b> [...] is the per-minute charge, and [...] is {{the duration of the}} call in minutes. Local toll calls are traditionally grouped into two price ranges, called [...] "near zone" [...] and [...] "far zone", with values of [...] and [...] higher for far zone.|$|E
5000|$|Most areas permit local {{calls to}} be dialed as 1+10D except for California, Oregon, Texas, parts of Florida (such as Miami) and {{many parts of}} Canada (such as Ontario) which {{requires}} that callers know which numbers are local and which are toll, dialing 10D for all local calls and 1+10D for all <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the {{telephone}} industry when rotary dial instruments were in use, the polarity when connecting a telephone set to the tip and ring wires was usually important only for properly ringing a telephone, especially in party line service with selective ringing, and for correctly identifying the calling customer on certain party lines for <b>toll</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} never used for {{overseas}} telephone links, which (before {{the advent of}} undersea cables and satellites) were provided by two New Zealand Post Office radio stations, Makara Radio (receiving) west of Wellington and Himatangi Radio Station (transmitting) near Himatangi Beach. Only {{a limited number of}} voice circuits were available, and overseas <b>toll</b> <b>calls</b> were expensive.|$|R
