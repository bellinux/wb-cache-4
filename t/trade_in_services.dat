5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on <b>Trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>Services,</b> and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E

The empirical results of the determinants of IIT indicate that foreign direct investment <b>in</b> insurance <b>services</b> (FDI) is a significant contributor to the volume of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> insurance <b>services.</b> These empirical findings confirm the new theoretical trade models that, unlike the traditional trade theory that considered trade and foreign direct investment <b>in</b> insurance <b>services</b> as substitutes, trade and FDI complement each other and hence multinational insurance companies are contributing {{to an increase in}} the volume of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> insurance <b>services.</b> Furthermore, this study shows that trade intensity between the United States and its trading partners leads to product differentiation <b>in</b> insurance <b>services</b> and hence an increase in consumer welfare.
