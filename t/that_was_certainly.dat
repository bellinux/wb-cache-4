25|$|In {{a general}} way, {{the reign of}} law and order in the {{movements}} of the heavenly bodies was recognized, and indeed must have exercised an influence at an early period in leading to the rise of a methodical divination <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> of a much higher order than the examination of an animal's liver.|$|E
25|$|Up to 1888 it was believed, {{on account}} of the {{testimony}} of one of Elizabeth's servants during the canonization process, that Elizabeth was driven from the Wartburg in the winter of 1227 by her brother-in-law, Heinrich Raspe, who acted as regent for her son, then only five years old. About 1888 various investigators (Börner, Mielke, Wenck, E. Michael, etc.) asserted that Elizabeth left the Wartburg voluntarily. She was not able at the castle to follow Konrad's command to eat only food obtained in a way <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> right and proper.|$|E
500|$|Waugh did not query his friend's judgement, {{but took}} his {{manuscript}} to the school's furnaces and unceremoniously burnt it. Immediately afterwards {{he received the}} news that the job with Scott Moncrieff had fallen through. The double blow affected Waugh severely; he wrote in his diary in July: [...] "The phrase 'the end of the tether' besets me with unshakeable persistence". In his biography Waugh writes: [...] "I went down alone to the beach with my thoughts full of death. I took off my clothes and began swimming out to sea. Did I really intend to drown myself? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> in my mind". He left a note with his clothes, a quotation from Euripides about the sea washing away all human ills. A short way out, after being stung by jellyfish, he abandoned the attempt, turned round and swam back to the shore. He did not, however, withdraw his resignation from the school, returning instead to London.|$|E

2500|$|Croke argued [...] like Barry basing his {{argument}} on Vattel's The Law of Nations [...] that international law validated such acquisition of sovereignty over [...] "uncivilised" [...] peoples, providing that adequate territory {{were left to}} them for their sustenance, and said that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> {{the case in the}} Australian colonies.|$|E
2500|$|... 1878 was a [...] "chilly and wet summer" [...] {{in which}} the bad wickets reduced [...] "all (batsmen) to {{comparative}} impotence" [...] but enabled bowlers to dominate and cause [...] "havoc" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the case at Lord's on 27 May. CricketArchive states without elaboration that: [...] "the match was scheduled for three days but completed in one".|$|E
2500|$|A police {{superintendent}} {{said to the}} BBC that Campbell [...] "developed {{a relationship}} with Danielle <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> inappropriate and probably unlawful."

2500|$|Fictionalized {{elements}} of Vinea's life was recorded {{not just in}} his own prose, but also in that of his peers. As early as 1927, he was a possible inspiration for [...] "Șcheianu", the drug-addicted protagonist of Cezar Petrescu's Întunecare ("Darkening"); he {{may also be the}} Romanian intellectual briefly mentioned in Tender Is the Night. Vinea is an easily recognizable presence in Family Chronicle—the part of it <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> authored by Dumitriu. Posthumously, Vinea also became the basis for several characters in Henriette Stahl's novels, beginning with a vengeful portrayal, as [...] "Camil Tomescu", in Fratele meu, omul ("My Brother Man").|$|E
2500|$|Sometime in {{the medieval}} period, water power {{was applied to the}} {{bloomery}} process. [...] It is possible that this was at the Cistercian Abbey of Clairvaux as early as 1135, but it was certainly in use in early 13th century France and Sweden. [...] In England, the first clear documentary evidence for this is the accounts of a forge of the Bishop of Durham, near Bedburn in 1408, [...] but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> not the first such ironworks. [...] In the Furness district of England, powered bloomeries were in use into the beginning of the 18th century, and near Garstang until about 1770.|$|E
2500|$|When Humboldt {{first began}} his studies of organisms and the {{environment}} he claimed {{that he wanted to}} [...] "reorganize the general connections that link organic beings and to study the great harmonies of Nature". He is often considered one of the world's first genuine ecologists. Humboldt succeeded in developing a comprehensive science that joined the separate branches of natural philosophy under a model of natural order founded on the concept of dynamic equilibrium. Humboldt's work reached far beyond his personal expeditions and discoveries. Figures from all across the globe participated on his work. Some such participants included French naval officers, East India Company physicians, Russian provincial administrators, Spanish military commanders, and German diplomats. Furthermore, as was aforementioned, Charles Darwin carried a copy of Humboldt's Personal Narrative aboard H.M.S. Beagle. Humboldt's projects, particularly those related to natural philosophy, {{played a significant role in}} the influx of European money and travelers to Spanish America in increasing numbers in the early 19th century. Sir Edward Sabine, a British scientist, worked on terrestrial magnetism in a manner <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> Humboldtian. Also, British scientist George Gabriel Stokes depended heavily on abstract mathematical measurement to deal with error in a precision instrument; certainly Humboldtian science. Maybe the most prominent figure whose work can be considered representative of Humboldtian science, is geologist Charles Lyell. Despite a lack of emphasis on precise measurement in geology at the time, Lyell insisted on precision in a Humboldtian manner.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, Professor John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law {{and also}} Professor of Art at Stanford University, putting aside the {{discrepancy}} presented by Rudenstine, argues {{that since the}} Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. The Ottoman sultan was grateful to the British for repelling Napoleonic expansion, and the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him. Further, that written permission exists {{in the form of}} the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles. He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles [...] "is at best ambiguous", adding that the document [...] "provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon...The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects".|$|E
