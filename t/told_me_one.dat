2500|$|During the war, this {{curiosity and}} {{propaganda}} underwent a transformation. Most of the German population realised that {{the fate of}} the prisoners of war was shared by their own absent detainees, and, from 1915, the prisoners noted that the visitors’ vehemence had cooled. Little by little a relationship built on understanding developed, as Charles Gueugnier, a simple zouave, noted in his daily diary: “Beautiful day, many visitors around the camp; among this crowd black dominates: grief has driven away their insolent smugness. All these griefs that pass through, I sympathise with them and salute in them those who have died for their fatherland. Especially, all these little ones hurt me a lot, because it’s sad”. Work also allowed prisoners to know the population better and better, and the longer the war dragged on, the more relaxed these relationships became. Robert d’Harcourt notes: “The inhabitants seemed rather indifferent to the war. The neighbourhood barber’s wife [...] <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> day: ‘What the f___ do we care about Alsace-Lorraine? Let them give it to the French and let the slaughter cease’." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prince Rogers Nelson {{was born}} on June 7, 1958 in Minneapolis, to Mattie Della (née Shaw; 1933–2002) and John Lewis Nelson (1916–2001). His parents were both African-American and his family ancestry is {{centered}} in Louisiana, with all four of his grandparents hailing from that state. Prince's father was a pianist and songwriter, {{and his mother was}} a jazz singer. Prince was given his father's stage name, Prince Rogers, which his father used while performing with a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In 1991, Prince's father told A Current Affair, [...] "I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do." [...] Prince's childhood nickname was Skipper. Prince has said he was [...] "born epileptic" [...] and [...] "used to have seizures" [...] when he was young. He also said, [...] "My mother <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said, 'Why?' and I said, 'Because an angel told me so.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Israeli novelist Irit Linur {{set off a}} wave of {{subscription}} cancellations to Haaretz in 2002, {{when she}} wrote {{an open letter to}} the paper cancelling her own subscription.Translation: it is a person's right to be a radical leftist, and publish a newspaper in accordance with this world view.... However Haaretz reached a stage where its anti-Zionism turns too frequently to silly and mean journalism. Original:Translation: When Gideon Levy accuses Israel of turning Marwan Barghouti from a peace seeker to an impresario of suicide bombings, it is as logical an interpretation, just as the claim that the wave of attacks on 11 September were a plot by Mossad. In a private conversation with him, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> time that he would not travel a hundred meters {{to save the life of}} a settler, and it seems to me that his loves and hates have been long tainting his heart-rending reports from the occupied Palestinian territories. Original: [...] "It is a person's right to be a radical leftist, and publish a newspaper in accordance with his world view... However Haaretz has reached the point where its anti-Zionism has become stupid and evil", she wrote. She also accused Levy of amateurism because he does not speak Arabic.|$|E

6000|$|... "Me? I {{only know}} what Mr. Hopkins <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> I'm <b>one</b> of his {{confidential}} men. But {{he never said}} how he happened to find the girl, or what he knew about her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "I am {{glad you}} <b>told</b> <b>me!</b> <b>One</b> thinks better {{of human nature}} after hearing a tale like that. In a way, it's a rebuke. Are such men numerous?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{asked the}} other man that, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of Lord Mountclere's upper servants. I knew then there was no harm in having been civil to him. He is well-mannered, and talks splendid language.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{highness}} will observe," [...] he stammered, [...] "that {{you have}} already <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>one</b> of these dishes is poisoned. I cannot say which, and whichever I eat may be the fatal one." ...|$|R

6000|$|It was {{owing to}} her reduced {{circumstances}} that the proud Doña Maria had received under her roof Marjorie and myself, for she loved not the Americans; but, as she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> artlessly <b>one</b> day, [...] "Only the Americans now have gold.|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>One</b> of {{the police}} authorities, whom he has seen already, is staying at the hotel to-night. Jernyngham means {{to get hold of}} him and insist upon an {{explanation}} of what they are doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And you, Miss Dacre, {{remind me}} of my old friend, the Duchess of Nevers, who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> day that {{in the course of}} her {{experience}} she had only met one man who was her rival in repartee.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your Grace,' said Miss Dacre, 'reminds {{me of my}} old friend, Prince Rubarini, who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{day that}} when he got up late he always gave orders to have the sun put {{back a couple of}} hours.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> or {{the other}} of you had said so. We won't stand that--we'll have you arrested for--for {{defamation}} of character!" [...] stormed the rival auctioneer, working himself up into a fine pitch of assumed indignation.|$|E
60|$|Ada <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{day that}} Percy {{had asked her}} the reason of my {{remaining}} away so; but I {{told her she had}} no one to blame but herself, who had made me uncomfortable by talking nonsense to me about him.|$|E
60|$|The {{incident}} that Jephson's remark had reminded me of, she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> afternoon, as I sat propped {{up by the}} fire, trying to drink a glass of port wine, and feeling somewhat depressed at discovering I did not like it.|$|E
60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that at <b>one</b> time, before Thayendanega {{had become}} so {{powerful}} a sachem, he and General Herkimer were near neighbors, and quite intimate friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "His looks must be wonderfully expressive. He did {{not look}} it to me at all. He simply <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> as <b>one</b> of the {{managers}} of the theatre, I was to let you have whatever money you wanted. And he did whisper to me,--may I {{tell you what he}} whispered?" ...|$|R

60|$|TANNER. It's all my own doing: that's {{the horrible}} irony of it. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{day that you}} were to be Ann's guardian; and like a fool I began arguing with him about the folly of leaving a young woman {{under the control of}} an old man with {{obsolete}} ideas.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you are dying, Martin, mon ami? How odd!

6000|$|... "Nobody {{was with}} him. Phil <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. No <b>one,</b> that is, but a young {{lieutenant}} {{and his own}} servant. It was very sad. He had D.T., and {{all that sort of}} thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{the good}} God makes them strong,' said Estelle, {{in a low}} voice.

'We-ell'--Dan {{liked to}} be accurate, {{especially}} when he was shy--'old Hobd--a friend of mine <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>one</b> of the beaters got peppered last week--hit in the leg, I mean.

60|$|I {{was quite}} at home now in society, and knew nearly every one, {{and enjoyed the}} {{conversation}} now as much, or more, than the dancing.

6000|$|... "Yes, I will," [...] he said {{between his}} teeth. [...] "You {{were talking to}} Miss Silver about me this morning.

6000|$|... "That is the {{incident}} that changed the character of my man--if it be changed," [...] concluded Jephson. [...] "He <b>told</b> it <b>me</b> <b>one</b> night as {{we sat on the}} deck of the steamer, returning from Bombay. He did not spare himself. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the story, much as I have told it to you, but in an even, monotonous tone, free from emotion of any kind. I asked him, when he had finished, how he could bear to recall it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} right," [...] said Ozma, {{who did not}} seem a bit surprised. [...] "Had Ojo <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>one</b> {{of the things he}} sought was the wing of a yellow {{butterfly}} I would have informed him, before he started out, that he could never secure it.
