The voting system as of the 2016 AFL season, consists of four members of the match committee giving each player a ranking out of ten after each game. Players can receive a maximum of 40 votes for a game.|$|E
5|$|John's wishes come true, {{though he}} is unaware that the Green-Eyed One owes Elspeth, his hideous spellcasting sister, a wish of her own. In order to fulfill her ambitions, the Green-Eyed One {{transforms}} Elspeth into {{a beautiful young woman}} who can now marry John and become his queen, second and new wife, and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband, John, and stepdaughter, Snow White (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is <b>the</b> <b>fairest</b> of them all whenever she asks.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> took {{a five-year}} hiatus from 1942 to 1946. But <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> {{was back in}} {{operation}} in 1947. 1950 saw the first carnival rides at <b>the</b> <b>Fair.</b> In 1956, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Board petitioned <b>the</b> Alaska Legislature for official designation as <b>the</b> Alaska State <b>Fair.</b> In 1960, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> celebrated its 25th anniversary and was paid a visit by President John F.

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>fair</b> {{was held}} in 1878 and was known as <b>the</b> Lutherville <b>Fair.</b> <b>The</b> {{following}} year, 1879, <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> was moved to its current location in Timonium and was held from September 9 through September 12. In 1906, <b>the</b> Lutherville <b>Fair</b> merged with <b>the</b> Pimlico <b>Fair</b> and became known as <b>the</b> Maryland State <b>Fair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fair</b> was suspended from 1943 through 1945 during World War II.

50|$|In August 1893, the U.S. Congress {{approved}} for <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> {{to be held}} in Golden Gate Park. Prior to <b>the</b> Midwinter <b>Fair's</b> opening day, in 1893, Isaiah West Taber won the concession to be the official photographer of <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b> Taber documented <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> from when <b>the</b> grading of the land began, and continued photographing <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> throughout its entirety. He sold his photos in a striking, multi-story pavilion during the exposition, on <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> grounds. At <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> he compiled about 130 of his original photographs into a souvenir book entitled Souvenir of the California Midwinter International Exposition. Much of what is known about <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> especially visually, comes from Taber's photographs.|$|R
5|$|One day, the Magic Mirror {{informs the}} Queen that Snow White is now <b>the</b> <b>fairest</b> in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White {{into the forest}} and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|When Prince Alfred {{arrives in}} the kingdom and {{falls in love with}} Snow White, Elspeth is furious to {{discover}} that images of Snow White are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is <b>the</b> <b>fairest</b> of them all. Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders Hector, a hunter, to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill Snow White, Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors, and stifles Snow White with an enchanted ribbon.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess Snow White. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes back with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is <b>the</b> <b>fairest</b> in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in Snow White anyway.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fair</b> is {{operated}} by a board of 100 shareholders. The shares were first sold in 1901 {{to raise funds for}} <b>the</b> <b>fair's</b> continued operation.

Although she looked glum, Sun Quan was still shocked by her beauty and was curious {{about the way she}} smiles. Lady Pan was later brought into the palace and loved by Sun Quan.|$|E

25|$|In the post-fight interview, Rampage {{expressed}} that <b>the</b> <b>fairest</b> {{thing would be}} to offer Machida an immediate rematch, as {{he felt he had}} lost the fight. Five of 7 media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida. However, since UFC President Dana White personally felt that Rampage won the fight, he denied the possibility of an immediate rematch. This generated some controversy, as White had previously awarded an immediate rematch to Rua in spite of a unanimous judgment decision awarded to Machida in that fight.|$|E

50|$|George Kessler, <b>the</b> <b>fair's</b> {{landscape}} architect, dramatically {{changed the}} park: the wetlands {{areas in the}} western part of the park were drained and converted into water features and five connected lakes. Sewer and water lines installed during <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> remained for public use in the park. After <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> thousands of trees were planted and vistas were created.

25|$|The provincial championships were {{introduced}} in 1888 in Munster, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster on a knock-out basis. The winners of the provincial finals participated in the All-Ireland semi-finals. Over time the Leinster and Munster teams grew to become the superpowers of the game, as Gaelic football was the more dominant sport in Ulster and Connacht. After some time Galway became the only credible team in Connacht and was essentially given an automatic pass to the All-Ireland semi-final every year. This knock-out system persisted for over 100 years and {{was considered to be}} <b>the</b> <b>fairest</b> system as the All-Ireland champions would always be the only undefeated team of the year.|$|E
25|$|All three goddesses were ideally {{beautiful}} and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes.

This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.|$|E
