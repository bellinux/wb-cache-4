5|$|In 1889, Adams {{broke the}} world record run for {{successive}} straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer, Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit with his fingers rather <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cue. Adams stated {{in an interview in}} his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.|$|E
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E

5|$|The area a pride {{occupies}} {{is called}} a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend {{to stay on the}} fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.|$|E
25|$|The Ares I prototype, Ares I-X, {{successfully}} completed a test launch on October 28, 2009. Launch Pad 39B was damaged more <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Space Shuttle launch. During descent, {{one of the}} three parachutes of the Ares I-X’s first stage failed to open, and another opened only partially, causing the booster to splash down harder and suffer structural damage.

25|$|One of {{the best-known}} is the {{stirring}} Chevy Chase, which tells of the Earl of Northumberland's vow to hunt for three days across the Border 'maugre the doughty Douglas'.

40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} {{theoretical}} {{comparison of the}} potential effectiveness, in terms of money stock controllability, of interest rate and reserve instruments. Whereas previous studies have been basically static, the present analysis is {{carried out in the}} context of a dynamic macroeconomic model with rational expectations. Particular attention is paid to the distinction between contemporaneous and lagged reserve accounting (CRA and LRA). The criterion employed is the expectation of squared deviations of the (log of the) money stock from target values that are reset each period. Analysis in the basic model suggests the following substantive conclusions. (1) <b>With</b> <b>a</b> reserve instrument, monetary control will be more effective under CRA <b>than</b> LRA. (2) <b>With</b> <b>a</b> reserve instrument and LRA, control will be poorer <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest rate instrument. (3) For a wide range of parameter values, control will be better <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reserve instrument and CRA <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest rate instrument. ...|$|R
25|$|End-window G-M {{detectors}} {{are still}} {{used as a}} general purpose portable radioactive contamination measurement and detection instrument, owing to their relatively low cost, robustness and their relatively high detection efficiency; particularly with high energy beta particles. However, for discrimination between alpha and beta particles or provision of particle energy information, scintillation counters or proportional counters should be used. Those instrument types are manufactured with much larger detector areas, which means that checking for surface contamination is quicker <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> G-M instrument.|$|E
25|$|While {{the sword}} and scales are {{traditional}} attributes of Iustitia, the Bernese statue's blindfold is a novelty; only later did it become a common element in personifications of Justice {{and a general}} symbol for the principle of equality before the law. The blindfold implies that justice {{ought to be done}} without respect to rank or standing; that a just verdict is arrived at through introspection rather <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to outward looks. Gieng's Iustitia is a symbol of republican justice, and was a forceful public reminder of the Bernese Republic's authority through law.|$|E

The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets {{that needed to be}} removed by moistening and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and sieved and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the grindstone back and forth, rather <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rotating motion.|$|E

25|$|Using a 3–4–3, the midfielders are {{expected}} to split their time between attacking and defending. Having only three dedicated defenders means that if the opposing team breaks through the midfield, {{they will have a}} greater chance to score <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more conventional defensive configuration, such as 4–5–1 or 4–4–2. However, the three forwards allow for a greater concentration on attack. This formation is used by more offensive-minded teams. The formation was famously used by Liverpool under Rafael Benítez {{during the second half of}} the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final to come back from a three-goal deficit.|$|E
25|$|Wilding {{is a young}} {{law student}} who gives up his studies to seek pleasure. He is a rake who uses people and wishes to marry Bellaria simply for money. Unlike Love in Several Masques, Fielding cares more about {{revealing}} hypocrisy <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> discussion of love and lovers, but he portrays the hypocrites {{in a manner that}} emphasises a comedic response instead of censure. Other characters want to have Bellaria, including the virtuous man Veromil and his foil Valentine who is unable to control his desires for Bellaria. Valentine eventually pairs with Clarissa, a character of little substance within the play, Veromil marries Bellaria, and Wilding does not marry.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{exceptions}} {{from the general}} rule of quick civil wars during this period. The American Civil War (1861–1865) was unusual {{for at least two}} reasons: it was fought around regional identities as well as political ideologies, and it ended through a war of attrition, rather <b>than</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decisive battle over control of the capital, as was the norm. The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) proved exceptional because both sides in the struggle received support from intervening great powers: Germany, Italy, and Portugal supported opposition leader Francisco Franco, while France and the Soviet Union supported the government (see proxy war).|$|E
