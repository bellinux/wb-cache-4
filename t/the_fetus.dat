5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to <b>the</b> <b>fetus.</b> Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in <b>the</b> <b>fetus,</b> leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{cross the}} placenta, enter <b>the</b> <b>fetus,</b> {{and are also}} {{excreted}} in breast milk. Chronic administration of diazepam, another benzodiazepine, to nursing mothers {{has been reported to}} cause their infants to become lethargic and to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} three months of fetal development, the sebaceous glands of <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> produce vernix caseosa, a waxy white {{substance}} that coats the skin to protect it from amniotic fluid.|$|E

5|$|If {{the fetal}} remains {{are found in}} a fetal {{position}} and are wholly within the pelvic cavity of the adult, <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> died and was interred prior to delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5000|$|Neonatal {{hepatitis}} {{is a form}} {{of hepatitis}} that affects <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> and neonates.|$|R
50|$|This {{procedure}} {{involves the}} ligation or otherwise occlusion of {{the umbilical cord}} to interrupt the exchange of blood between <b>the</b> <b>fetuses.</b> <b>The</b> procedure is typically offered in cases where one of <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> is presumed moribund and endangering the life or health of the other twin through resultant hypotension. Use of this treatment has decreased as TTTS is identified and treated in earlier stages and with better outcomes. When used, it is associated with an 85% survival rate of <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetus(es)</b> with 5% risk of cerebral palsy and a 33-39 weeks of gestation at delivery.|$|R
50|$|In one study, {{in which}} rats {{received}} {{a maximum of}} 1.25 mg/kg/day, no effects on reproduction were observed. In a study on pregnant river rats, eating 2.5 mg/kg/day, {{it was observed that}} <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> had increased incidences of delayed ossification of pubes. Another study found that <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> of pregnant rabbits, eating 9.6 mg/kg/day had increased incidences of fused sterna centers.|$|R
5|$|Linezolid is in U.S. {{pregnancy}} category C, meaning {{there have}} been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to <b>the</b> <b>fetus,</b> the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs. The {{largest group of}} mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> during gestation.|$|E
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to <b>the</b> <b>fetus.</b> Examples include the removal of a fallopian tube {{in the case of an}} ectopic pregnancy, removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus, or an appendectomy.|$|E
5000|$|State law {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> to be cremated or buried [...] "within {{a reasonable}} time".|$|R
5000|$|In August 1985, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ordered <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> {{be turned}} over to the Guerra-Gutirrez-Alexander Mortuary for burial. Per the court's order, the {{mortuary}} was selected because they did not have a religious affiliation. At the time, it was noted by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services that <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> had been kept in [...] "five pine boxes". The department assured ACLU that there were no identifying marks on canisters containing <b>the</b> <b>fetuses,</b> and ACLU stated they would not object to a secular burial. While ACLU would not object, the Feminist Women's Health Center petitioned the Los Angeles Superior Court to block the burial, but the courts refused.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of {{antiviral}} analyses, only two out of <b>the</b> five <b>fetuses</b> inoculated with AgNO 3 -PVP/APTMS/TEOS-incubated viral suspension were infected, suggesting that the composite reduces viral infection capability by 60 %.

5|$|A Syndicate surgeon {{attempting}} to procure the alien fetus is killed {{by one of}} the alien rebels, who assumes his form. Krycek finds the dead surgeon and <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> missing, and tells Spender that the rebels are now going to succeed in their goals to halt colonization. The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base. Shortly after Fowley arrives, a white light appears around one end of the hangar. It is revealed to be the rebels, who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate—except for The Smoking Man and Fowley—who escape by car.|$|E
5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to <b>the</b> <b>fetus,</b> make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of <b>the</b> <b>fetus.</b> In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
40|$|Seventy two unfixed {{bodies of}} 4 - 6 -month old human fetuses {{have been studied}} {{by means of a}} complex of methods of a morphologic {{research}} (somatoscopy, anthropometry, contrast radiography) and a statistical analysis. It has been established that during the second trimester of the intrauterine development a tendency towards a lover skeletopic position and the larger diapason of the individual position of the sphincter components of the extrahepatic bile ducts (EBD) in <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> of male gender is traced compared with <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> of <b>the</b> female gender of the same parietocalcaneal length. The skeletopy of the sphincter components of the EBD reliably correlates with the somatotype of <b>the</b> <b>fetuses.</b> Asymmetric dynamics of changes of the skeletopy of the sphincter components of the EBD is traced in <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> from <b>the</b> beginning of 6 th month of development and depend on <b>the</b> somatotype of <b>fetuses.</b> <b>The</b> periods {{from the end of the}} 4 th and to the beginning of the 5 th months and the beginning of the 6 th month may be considered to be critical in the development of the sphincter components of the EBD as a time of appearance of variants of its structure and a feasible appearing of malformations...|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{developing}} <b>fetus,</b> <b>the</b> ductus arteriosus, {{also called}} the ductus Botalli, is a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass <b>the</b> <b>fetus's</b> fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Upon closure at birth, it becomes the ligamentum arteriosum. There are two other fetal shunts, the ductus venosus and the foramen ovale.|$|R
50|$|Alcohol use {{leads to}} {{disruptions}} of <b>the</b> <b>fetus's</b> brain development, interferes with <b>the</b> <b>fetus's</b> cell development and organization, and affects the maturation {{of the central}} nervous system. Alcohol use can lead to heart and other major organ defects, such as small brain, which will affect <b>the</b> <b>fetus's</b> learning behaviors. Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause behavioral problems in a child, mental problems or retardation and facial abnormalities - meaning smaller eyes, thin upper lip, and little groove between the nose and lips. Use can also {{increase the risk of}} miscarriages and stillbirths, or low birth weight. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a developmental disorder that is a consequence of too much alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy. Children with FAS have a variety of distinctive facial features, brain abnormalities, and cognitive deficits.|$|R
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
50|$|The Los Angeles County District Attorney, John Van de Kamp, said <b>the</b> <b>fetuses</b> {{would be}} {{individually}} examined and charges would be filed against <b>the</b> doctors if <b>fetuses</b> were over <b>the</b> 20-week gestation limit allowed by California {{law at the}} time. Officials found 193 fetuses {{that appeared to be}} over the 20-week limit. Van de Kamp wanted to turn <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses</b> over to groups who would perform memorial services on them.|$|R
40|$|Due to a {{surge in}} the {{availability}} of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increasing. Preterm labor is a major complication in such pregnancies. Preterm delivery of <b>the</b> first <b>fetus</b> is often followed by delivery of <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses.</b> However, conservative management and delayed interval delivery in <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses</b> might allow for fetal lung maturity and would reduce perinatal morbidities. A 32 -year-old female had a quadruplet pregnancy after receiving ART. Fetal reduction to triplet pregnancy was performed at 11 weeks of gestation. The remaining triplet pregnancy was stable until 29 weeks of gestation, when the first triplet was delivered after spontaneous rupture of membranes. Under intensive monitoring, <b>the</b> remaining 2 <b>fetuses</b> were delivered by cesarean section at 31 weeks of gestation. Only <b>the</b> first <b>fetus</b> had retinopathy after discharge. In conclusion, delayed interval delivery of <b>the</b> remaining <b>fetuses</b> should be attempted after preterm delivery of <b>the</b> first <b>fetus...</b>|$|R

5|$|The fetal {{hypothalamus}} and pituitary {{start to}} secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, {{the production of}} thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically significant and self-sufficient level. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50ng/dL at full-term. <b>The</b> <b>fetus</b> needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism.

5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) <b>the</b> <b>fetus</b> possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid.
