2500|$|He {{was quite}} {{intensely}} religious, {{because even though}} he uses the word Providence, he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life, particularly in American life. [...] I mean, every single victory in war he credits to Providence. [...] The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence. [...] The creation {{of the federal government}} and the prosperity of the early republic, he credits to Providence... I was struck at how frequently in his letters he's referring to Providence, and it's Providence where there's a sense of design and purpose, which sounds to me very much like religion... Unfortunately, <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>issue</b> has become very very politicized.|$|E
2500|$|On November 12, 1903, {{because of}} public {{dissatisfaction with the}} 1903 2-cent Washington [...] "Flag" [...] stamp, the Post Office issued a new 2-cent stamp {{featuring}} Washington's portrait within a shield of stars and stripes. Often {{referred to as the}} 2-cent Washington [...] "Shield" [...] stamp, this issue was released on November 12, 1903. Along with the shield background, the left numeral is enclosed with laurel leaves while the number on the right is surrounded with oak leaves, symbolizing Washington's role as president in peace time and as general in times of war. Unlike the first 2¢ stamp of 1903, this issue was designed by Clair Aubrey Huston from a painting by Gilbert Stuart. The engraving of Washington was done by George F. C. Smillie. The Washington [...] "Shield" [...] stamp is recognized for its many shade varieties, as collectors have distinguished over a hundred shades of <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>issue</b> and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do.

The bulk of British opinion cannot go on being represented for ever by President Wilson. We cannot always look to the Americans to express our ideas and do our work for democracy. The foolery of the Berlin Treaty must not be repeated. We cannot have another popular Prime Minister come triumphing back to England with a gross of pink spectacles--through which we may survey {{the prospect of the}} next great war. The League of Free Nations means something very big and solid; it is not a rhetorical phrase to be used to pacify a restless, distressed, and anxious public, and to be sneered out of existence when that use is past. When the popular mind now demands a League of Free Nations it demands a reality. The only way to that reality is through the direct participation of {{the nation as a whole}} in the settlement, and that is possible only through the direct election for <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>issue</b> of representative and responsible men.|$|E
