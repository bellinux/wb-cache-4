50|$|As {{with any}} used vehicle, overall vehicle {{condition}} varies greatly. Many {{aspects of the}} vehicle appearance may suffer in the term of everyday use and result {{in any of the}} following damages: stained or otherwise used upholstery, scratched bumpers, dings on the doors, chipped hood, dented quarter panels. Most of these can be fixed with <b>touch-up</b> <b>paint</b> and/or a dent removing kit. Scraped wheels and worn tires may cost more to repair or replace.|$|E
5000|$|In 1927, Carl Miller {{opened a}} Hudson Sales and Service {{franchise}} on the site, and in 1955 the dealership was renamed Miller Motors, reflecting expanded product offerings. From 1927 until the Hudson Motor Car Company {{merged with the}} Nash-Kelvinator Corporation on May 1st 1954 to form American Motors Corporation, the dealership sold 1,969 new cars, and has retained and preserved all dealership records since opening. For about 20 years, Miller Motors continued as a used car and parts dealer specializing in Hudsons and Hudson parts. Before Miller Motors was bought and included as {{a feature of the}} museum, Miller Motors was [...] "the place to go when [...] needed clutch oil or <b>touch-up</b> <b>paint,</b> or wanted to buy or sell a Hudson." [...] Retired Museum Curator Jack Miller is known as an authority on restoring Hudson cars and the history of Hudson cars.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet Toronto's {{projected}} transit ridership growth, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) proposed a new bus garage at the McNicoll Avenue site, located in the northeast part of Toronto. The current capacity of the existing TTC bus garages is approximately 1, 630 buses. The forecasted growth in transit ridership will require the acquisition of approximately 120 additional buses by 2018. As such, TTC determined the current bus garage capacity must be increased by over 200 buses {{within the next five}} years and it will require a new bus garage in order to accommodate the growth. The proposed facility will be located on McNicoll Avenue, just east of Kennedy Road. When built, the facility will be able to accommodate 250 conventional buses, a maintenance shop and office, a transportation office and a bus service area. The maintenance shop will include maintenance bays, brake shop, degrease shop, body shop, <b>touch-up</b> <b>paint</b> shop and an inspection shop. The potential environmental impacts of the project are being assessed under th...|$|E
50|$|The main {{structure}} {{was built in}} 1928. After years of serving as an {{elementary and high school}} campus, in 1990 Old High Middle School was established. 1990-1991 also brought about renovations to the beloved auditorium. The Bentonville/Bella Vista Rotary Club worked with the community to renovate the original structure with one third of the monies raised coming from a concert by New Kids on the Block. In May 2015, Old High Middle School's auditorium was chosen as one of the venues for the Bentonville Film Festival. After many preparations to the school, including refinishing the stage, <b>touch-up</b> <b>painting,</b> and updating the dressing rooms backstage, it was concluded that the popularity of the film festival demanded a larger venue. In May 2016, Old High did play host to the successful Bentonville Film Festival including actress Geena Davis.|$|R

40|$|Worker {{activities}} at automobile refinishing shops include wet sanding, car washing, stripping (paint removal), machine sanding, blowing, buffing, polishing, paint spraying, paint and primer mixing, and inspection (Pfanstiehl, 1992). In contrast, worker {{at or near}} automobile OEM painting operations operate robotics painting equipment, perform mixing, clean paint booths, inspect vehicles, and perform manual "touch-up " painting. It is expected that manual <b>touch-up</b> <b>painting</b> operations would be conducted in spray booths, allowing minimal or no over spray to other sections of the plant. Number of Workers/Site EPA found that a typical automobile refinishing shop employs 4 employees in production (BSB, 1995) 1. The number of production employees ranges from 1. 9 to 10. 1, on average depending on shop size, with an overall average for all shops of 3. 88. EPA estimated that at new automobile manufacturing facilities, 17 workers are involved in manual “touch-up ” painting. EPA found no information indicating that other workers in painting operations would be potentially exposed to polyisocyanates (USEPA, 1994 b). Inhalation Exposure EPA found exposure data specific to the automobile refinishing industry for both total mist levels during spray painting, and isocyanate levels during spray painting. The data, presented in Appendix B represents a variety of engineering controls and spray gun types. The data show a lowering of worker exposure to isocyanate in downdraft paint booths compared with crossdraft 1 The BSB data was compiled {{from the results of}} a voluntary survey sent to 4, 000 body shops in early 1995, of which 1, 662 were returned. Not every shop answered every question, so the actual number of respondents to a particular question is unknown, but much less than 1, 662. The distribution of 1994 sales from the BSB survey is comparable to 1992 Department of Commerce data for SIC 7532 (top, body, and upholstery repair shops and paint shops). Due to different presentation methods between the two sources, more exact comparisons are not possible...|$|R
