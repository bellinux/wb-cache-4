40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plant <b>turbosets,</b> the design-basis {{accident}} consists of a blade-off on the low pressure turbine last stage. During the accidental shutdown, a severe rotor-casing interaction may occur at critical speeds due to large shaft line displacements originated by a high unbalance excitation. The contact between the shaft and the stator, also called the diaphragm in this study, induces an important angular deceleration rate and greatly modifies the turbogenerator dynamics including the amplitude of the loads in the bearings. Therefore the main objective is to verify that the designed turbine is capable of going through critical speeds without catastrophic consequences for the shaft line. To this end, {{a model of a}} turbogenerator has been developed to compute rotor speed transients by considering the rotating speed of the rotor as an unknown, which allows for the angular deceleration due to rubbing to be calculated in a more realistic fashion. Lagrange multipliers method is applied to compute contact forces. The diaphragm, which is a non-rotating bladed disks assembly, is modeled by curved and straight beams, and different assumptions for the contact detection are studied to find a compromise between CPU time and accuracy. Results of the numerical tool show that the contact forces are sensitive to the retained assumptions only when heavy rub occurs. Nevertheless, the rotating speed and bearing loads are computed with a satisfactory accuracy, even with an approximation on contact detection that saves CPU time...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{application}} of sensitivity analysis for design verification of nuclear <b>turboset.</b> Before the acquisition of a turbo generator, EDF performs independent design assessment in order to assure safe operating conditions of the new machine in its environment. Variables of interest {{are related to the}} vibration behaviour of the machine: its eigenfrequencies and dynamic sensitivity to unbalance. In the framework of design verification, epistemic uncertainties are preponderant. This lack of knowledge is due to inexistent or imprecise information about the design as well as to interaction of the rotating machinery with supporting and sub-structures. Sensitivity analysis allows to rank sources of uncertainty with respect to their importance and, possibly, to screen out insignificant sources of uncertainty. Further studies can then focus on predominant parameters. In particular, the constructor can be asked for detailed information only about the most significant parameters. JRC. DG.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of application of low-boiling fluids in supercritical cycles of power plants (conventional and nuclear) which generate cheap electrical energy {{are described in}} this paper. Working fluid should have appropriate critical temperature {{in order to obtain}} high cycle efficiency. When the critical temperature of working fluid in the supercritical two-phase cycles is too high, there is no possibility for utilization of heat regeneration in a simple recuperator. High critical temperature in one-phase cycles makes heat regeneration ineffective. When the critical temperature is too low, great compression work is required due to the low fluid density and the efficiency of power plant decreases. Furthermore, the working fluid should have no corrosive effects and should be thermal stable at high temperature, nontoxic, easily available in nature and relatively cheap. Reduction of internal irreversibility of thermodynamical cycles (i. e., increasing their efficiency) at supercritical conditions can be obtained by additional compression of a part or of entire flow of working fluid. It causes a decrease of useful power of <b>turboset,</b> thus limiting the possibility of realization of very large power-generating units. In addition, the results of calculation of the efficiency of supercritical cycles employing CO 2 as working medium, are given...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{computer}} program XAG {{has been developed}} for aiding the design of arbitrary ther-mal power plants. It is the third {{in a series of}} software developed for evaluating the thermo-dynamic and economic performances of power plants operating on the Brayton and/or Rankine cycle. The mechanics of operation of XAG is described in this article {{and the use of the}} software is illustrated in the design improvement of a turbo fuel cell. The tenets on which the software was developed are that power plants must be designed for minimum cost of plant product(s) and that this minimum cost must occur at a performance level that is practical and which reflects the state of the art. It is necessary, therefore, that the analysis of plant per-formance be carried out on an exergy basis and that the optimization be conducted on a ther-moeconomic basis. The results of the analysis of the turbo fuel cell show that the cost attributable to the fuel cell was primarily due to capital cost, whereas that attributable to the gas <b>turboset</b> was due primarily to exergy destruction in the components of the gas turbine. It was concluded that research efforts should be directed at reducing the capital cost of fuel cells to make the technology competitive...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 125 - 132. The {{reliability}} of a steam <b>turboset</b> is dependent, among other things, on correct functioning of its hydraulic lubrication and control system. An essential requirement is a reliable oil supply {{over the whole}} operating range. The main oil pump carries {{to a large degree}} this responsibility. The design and operational aspects of it will be dealt with in this paper. Air dispersed in oil is known to endanger, in extreme cases, the safe and reliable operation of the turbogroup. Besides operating interferences of various system components an interruption of oil supply to the bearings may result in serious consequences. Without going into details of oil qualities, operational consequences as well as corrective measures, of air present in oil will be discussed. The increasing specific demands imposed upon steam turbines may bring about new oil system difficulties. The subject matter presented here treats extreme cases of thermal loading of the lube oil as in the case when coming into contact with hot turbine parts. The resulting coke deposits in bearings may cause failure. With the assistance of experimental comparison tests lube oils on this basis are selected that will have the inherent capabilities to withstand such extreme operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, closed CO 2 cycles are {{investigated}} for potential application in existing nuclear power stations, referring {{in particular to}} Mochovce power station currently under construction in Slovak Republic. Three different CO 2 cycles layouts are explored {{in the range of}} temperatures offered by the nuclear source and of the existing cooling towers. The investigation shows that the common opinion that S-CO 2 cycles are well suited in the medium to a high temperature range only (higher than about 450 °C) seems unjustified. For a primary heat source with a maximum temperature of 299 °C and a heat sink with a minimum temperature of 19 °C and reasonable assumptions about advanced turbomachines and heat exchanger performances, the supercritical recompressed reheated regenerative CO 2 cycle would yield a net efficiency of 34. 04 %, which compares well with the 33. 51 % net efficiency of the existing Rankine cycle. The estimated length of the complete <b>turboset</b> (2 turbines, 1 pump and 1 compressor) would be less than 11 m (versus two wet steam turbines of 22 m each for the same power), resulting in a factor of 10 reduction in the footprint of the balance of plant. The total CO 2 cycle equipment and main pipelines would have a combined weight of 3957 tons, while in the Mochovce 3 NPP existing Rankine cycle, the main components and connecting piping weigh nearly 7377 tons, thus a 40 % reduction. These results suggest that the adoption of CO 2 in nuclear power stations would not penalize the plant efficiency and would yield significant savings on installation costs and construction times from the much more compact balance of plant...|$|E
40|$|A cost {{analysis}} is performed {{to investigate the}} influences of peremeters for companents of o power Station with a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor and with a helium turbine. As parameters are considered firstly those date of the power Station which are directly connected with the helium circuit (therrnodynamic date at determined positions, massflow or power), and secondly the data which are specific and free eligible for each component. The selected components area the recuperative heat-exchanger, the pre- and intermediate cooler, the cooling tower, the prestressed cancrete pressure-vessel, the <b>turboset,</b> and o section of the helium ducts. The main characteristic of the {{cost analysis}} is that absolute costs are avoided and substituted by relative casts. Reference for each compenent is a well specified base case, the costs of which are estimated in detai. The costing model developed for this purpose subdivides the costs of a component two times hierarchicallys first into physical perle and then into material costs and manufacturing costs. By relating the subdivided costs to the total costs of the component in the brise case, the relative cost changes can be led bock to constants, indicating the fractions of the subdivided costs an the total costs in the Base tose, multiplied with trist functions representing the relative cost changes of the subdivided costs for the case with changed parameters. These cost functions consisting of a brise function and a multiplicativecorrection term allow the consideration not only of generel tendencies bist also of individual conditions. The results of the cost analysis are presented under fair topics, using standardized tables and schemes: analysis, design, costing, and results {{in the first two}} sections the component is generolly described and the main dato and the conditions retained.
