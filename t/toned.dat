5|$|After Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg {{chose to}} {{compensate}} with {{a film that}} <b>toned</b> down the violence and gore. During the five years between Temple of Doom and Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's. Filming locations included Utah, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Jordan.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was <b>toned</b> down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the differences mentioned above, numerous other, local modifications of the structure, harmony or texture were applied to the original material. In these modifications, certain uniquely 'daring' original progressions were occasionally <b>toned</b> down, whereas in other places, the new version was even bolder than its predecessor.|$|E

50|$|The <b>tone</b> {{contours}} of the Sichuanese dialects are highly and quite {{different from those of}} Beijing Mandarin. In Sichuanese, the first <b>tone</b> (dark level <b>tone)</b> is a high level <b>tone</b> (like Beijing), the second <b>tone</b> (light level <b>tone)</b> is a low falling <b>tone</b> (the mirror image of Beijing), the third <b>tone</b> (rising <b>tone)</b> is a high falling <b>tone</b> and the fourth <b>tone</b> (departing <b>tone)</b> is a low or mid rising <b>tone</b> (interchanged compared to Beijing) and the fifth <b>tone</b> (entering <b>tone)</b> is mid or high if it's not merged, as shown in the chart below.|$|R
5000|$|Consider the {{intervals}} {{of the major}} scale: <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone. Starting the scale on a different degree will always create a new mode with individual interval layouts—for example starting on the second degree of a major scale gives the [...] "Dorian mode"—tone, semitone, <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone.</b> This is not so of the modes of limited transposition, which can be modally shifted {{only a limited number}} of times. For example, mode 1, the whole <b>tone</b> scale, contains {{the intervals}} <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone.</b> Starting on any degree of the mode gives the same sequence of intervals, and therefore the whole <b>tone</b> scale has only 1 mode. Messiaen's mode 2, or the diminished scale, consists of semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> which can be arranged only 2 ways, starting with either a <b>tone</b> or a semitone. Therefore mode 2 has two modes.|$|R
5|$|The presidential {{campaign}} was Obama's first {{exposure to the}} national political scene; even before the field of Democratic candidates was narrowed to two, she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses. Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about the Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she <b>toned</b> it down.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{does not}} dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and possibly Cobb, but {{says that the}} Klan had <b>toned</b> down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled in {{hundreds of thousands of}} non-racist men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the extreme}} nature of the {{original}} NES Battletoads difficulty, almost all future ports went to measures to tone it down to varying degrees, seeking to make the game more accessible to casual players. The Mega Drive version of Battletoads features <b>toned</b> down difficulty, {{as well as providing}} higher definition and more colourful graphics as opposed to the NES version. The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|E
5000|$|TRIART markers are {{an alcohol}} based marker, {{which allows for}} quicker dry time and less bleed. The 150 colors are {{color-coded}} for convenience.

50|$|When <b>Tone</b> No.1 meets another <b>Tone</b> No.1 or <b>Tone</b> No.4 meets <b>Tone</b> No.1, {{usually the}} {{previous}} <b>tone</b> turns to <b>Tone</b> No.5 {{and the next}} <b>tone</b> doesn't change, like “家家戶戶”jia'r5-jia'r1-hur6-hur4, “駕崩”jia5-beng1.|$|R
50|$|Shanghainese {{has five}} phonetically {{distinguishable}} <b>tones</b> for single syllables said in isolation. These <b>tones</b> are illustrated below in Chao <b>tone</b> names. In terms of Middle Chinese <b>tone</b> designations, the yin <b>tone</b> category has three <b>tones</b> (yinshang and yinqu <b>tones</b> have merged into one <b>tone),</b> while the yang category has two <b>tones</b> (the yangping, yangshang, and yangqu have merged into one <b>tone).</b>|$|R
5|$|Republicans in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans <b>toned</b> down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E
5|$|The Palmerston {{government}} considered {{recognizing the}} Confederacy {{as an independent}} nation. Seward was willing to wage war against Britain if it did, and drafted a strong letter for the American Minister in London, Charles Francis Adams, to read to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell. Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was {{in no position to}} battle both the South and Britain, <b>toned</b> it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams's guidance.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{government}} {{agreed to}} Beck's proposal, and the ultimatum was <b>toned</b> down. However, {{at the same}} time, Beck ordered military preparations. Poland assembled four divisions along the demarcation line; about 50,000 Polish troops were present, and just over 20,000 Lithuanian troops. The Polish troops were reinforced by armored vehicles, by two air force regiments, consisting of about one hundred aircraft, and by the Polish fleet {{in the waters of}} the Baltic Sea along the Lithuanian shore.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are five}} phonemic <b>tones</b> in Sichuanese: dark level <b>tone,</b> light level <b>tone,</b> rising <b>tone,</b> departing <b>tone</b> and {{entering}} <b>tone</b> (or checked <b>tone).</b> In some regions the checked <b>tone</b> of Sichuanese has been merged into another <b>tone,</b> {{which is very}} different from standard Mandarin, whose checked <b>tone</b> has been merged irregularly into the other 4 <b>tones.</b> According to Phonology of Sichuan dialect (四川方言音系), among all the 150 Sichuanese-speaking cities and counties, 48 keep the checked <b>tone</b> while the other 102 have only 4 <b>tones.</b> Particularly, in some sub-dialects of Minjiang dialect (such as Yingjing dialect), the departing <b>tone</b> has developed into two different tones: a colloquial <b>tone</b> (which is similar to the 2nd <b>tone</b> as a characteristic of Ba-Shu: [...] ) and a literary <b>tone</b> (which is the same as Chengdu dialect).|$|R
50|$|When <b>Tone</b> No.4 meets another <b>Tone</b> No.4, {{usually the}} {{previous}} <b>tone</b> turns to <b>Tone</b> No.5 {{and the next}} <b>tone</b> turns to <b>Tone</b> No.6, like “畢恭畢敬”bi5-gongr1-bi5-jingr6, “客客氣氣”ke'r4-ke'r-qi5-qi6.|$|R
5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an impression of a kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. The color is used for emotional impact; black and white (<b>toned</b> amber) represents the world of the white man; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
5|$|The entire cast {{from the}} {{previous}} games has been replaced with new characters. CO powers have been <b>toned</b> down, and no longer affect all units or the whole battle or the whole map. Tag powers from Dual Strike which allowed players to move twice in one turn have been removed. Players gain CO powers much later in the campaign than before, {{and they have a}} much less significant role in overall gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} in the pre-climax sequences was <b>toned</b> down to match the sensibilities of the Telugu audience after Venkatesh expressed scepticism {{as to whether the}} audience would accept him getting beaten up badly in the police station. During set construction for the police station and the house in the film, the producer and the director {{wanted to get rid of}} some coconut trees. However, art director Vivek managed to erect those sets without cutting down any trees.|$|E
5000|$|A changed <b>tone</b> {{usually takes}} the form of a non-high level, non-mid rising <b>tone</b> (i.e. <b>tones</b> 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Jyutping and Yale; see Cantonese {{phonology}} for further information on the <b>tones</b> in Cantonese) transforming into a mid-rising <b>tone</b> (<b>tone</b> 2); for some speakers, this changed <b>tone</b> is slightly lower than the citation mid-rising <b>tone.</b> For speakers with the high falling <b>tone,</b> this may also become the high level <b>tone</b> via the same process. [...] In many speakers, another form of a changed <b>tone</b> used in specific vocatives that may also result in a high level <b>tone</b> (<b>tone</b> 1), rather than in a mid-level <b>tone.</b>|$|R

50|$|Falling <b>tones</b> tend to fall {{further than}} rising <b>tones</b> rise; high-low <b>tones</b> are common, whereas low-high <b>tones</b> are quite rare. A {{language}} with contour <b>tones</b> will also generally {{have as many}} or more falling <b>tones</b> than rising <b>tones.</b> However, exceptions are not unheard of; Mpi, for example, has three level and three rising <b>tones,</b> but no falling <b>tones.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two 1970s police dramas {{featured}} protagonists with pet cockatoos. In the 1973 film Serpico, Al Pacino's character had a pet {{white cockatoo}} {{and the television}} show Baretta saw Robert Blake's character with Fred the Triton cockatoo. The popularity of the latter show saw a corresponding rise in popularity of cockatoos as pets in the late 1970s. Cockatoos have been used frequently in advertising; a cockatoo appeared in a 'cheeky' (and later <b>toned</b> down) 2008 advertising campaign for Cockatoo Ridge Wineries.|$|E
5|$|A pop ballad, {{the song}} {{includes}} instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} she thought about her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This <b>toned</b> down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
5|$|According to interviews, the {{characters}} {{were chosen for}} their popularity, and for parallels between them from both universes. Boon has said that some of {{the characters}}' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been <b>toned</b> down to make them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed that two new characters were developed as downloadable content, Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also hinted earlier at the prospect of Kung Lao and Doomsday being downloadable characters.|$|E
50|$|Changing <b>tones</b> (CT) are two {{successive}} nonharmonic <b>tones.</b> A chord <b>tone</b> {{steps to}} a nonchord <b>tone</b> which skips to another nonchord <b>tone</b> which leads by step to a chord <b>tone,</b> often the same chord <b>tone.</b> They may imply neighboring <b>tones</b> with a missing or implied {{note in the}} middle. Also called double neighboring <b>tones</b> or neighbor group.|$|R

5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue <b>toned,</b> hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then <b>toned</b> her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
5|$|Meta Knight {{also appears}} in three {{installments}} of the Super Smash Bros. video game series; in Super Smash Bros. Melee, he {{appears in the}} form of a trophy, and in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he is a playable character. However, Meta Knight was removed from professional gaming competitions in the United States and Canada due to being considered too powerful. Meta Knight returned as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U after the series' director, Masahiro Sakurai, assured some changes to re-add him; among the changes, Meta Knight lost his ability to glide, and his unrivaled attack speed was <b>toned</b> down.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tone</b> {{can often}} change meaning. , {{pronounced}} {{with a high}} <b>tone</b> followed by a high <b>tone,</b> means 'hand'. However, with two low <b>tones,</b> it means 'worm'. It changes again to mean 'notch mark' when it is pronounced with a high <b>tone</b> followed by a low <b>tone.</b> Finally is a fourth meaning when the high <b>tone</b> follows the low <b>tone,</b> 'place'.|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} <b>tones</b> spaces based on <b>tone</b> {{productions}} can {{be judged on}} {{the degree to which}} they (i) differentiate <b>tone</b> productions and (ii) predict <b>tone</b> perception. Here based on a production corpus, 5 different 2 -dimensional <b>tone</b> spaces are constructed.
