5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|DDT {{was banned}} in the US in 1972, after the {{discussion}} opened in 1962 by Silent Spring, written by American biologist Rachel Carson, which launched the environmental movement in the West. The book catalogued {{the environmental impacts of}} indiscriminate DDT spraying and suggested that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat <b>to</b> <b>wildlife.</b> The U.S. Agency for International Development supports indoor DDT spraying as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in tropical countries.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter. The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E

5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; {{of particular concern}} is {{the damage done to}} honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful <b>to</b> <b>wildlife.</b> There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E

5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> was reported.|$|E
5|$|Through {{its ability}} to work across a large range of animal species, {{universal}} primer technology can identify any bird, fish, reptile or mammal and satisfy legal evidence requirements {{in a court of}} law. Patents relating to this invention have been filed in several countries and the research papers published in various journals. This technique of CSIR-CCMB revitalised the field of wildlife forensics. It is currently being used routinely in LaCONES at the CSIR-CCMB to provide a wildlife forensics service across India in cases pertaining <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> crime.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous <b>to</b> <b>wildlife.</b> Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E

5|$|Herds {{of red and}} {{fallow deer}} also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home <b>to</b> <b>wildlife.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.|$|E

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts <b>to</b> <b>wildlife</b> hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E
