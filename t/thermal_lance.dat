50|$|The 2008 film The Bank Job is {{loosely based}} on the Baker Street robbery in 1971 in London, which used a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance.</b> In the film, the robbers {{successfully}} use a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> to cut a hole from underneath the reinforced concrete floor of the safe deposit box vault. However, in the actual robbery, the criminals tried but failed to achieve this with a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> and ultimately had to use explosives instead.|$|E
50|$|Popular {{depictions of}} thermal lances {{sometimes}} exaggerate their capabilities. In the movie The Score Nick Wells (played by Robert De Niro) uses a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> {{to cut a}} hole in the top of a safe, to avoid the safe's glass relocker device. A similar device was used in the 2012 film Stolen by Nicolas Cage's character. MythBusters tested the capabilities of the <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> and discovered opening a modern safe with a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> takes far longer than depicted in popular accounts. The intense heat also destroyed the items inside the vault (however, in the test, the items were simply inside the safe, while in the clip of The Score, shown in the episode, the contents were themselves in boxes). MythBusters concluded that using a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> for safe-cracking is plausible, but impractical.|$|E

50|$|Some high-security safes {{use what}} is called a glass relocker. It is a piece of {{tempered}} glass mounted between the safe door and the combination lock. It has wires attached to the edges. These wires lead to randomly located, spring-loaded bolts. If an attempt is made to penetrate the safe, the penetrating drill or torch breaks the glass and releases the bolts. These bolts block the retraction of the main locking bolts. To drill a safe with a glass relocker, side, top, or rear drilling may be necessary. Many modern high-security safes also incorporate thermal relockers in conjunction with glass-based relockers (usually a fusible link as part of the relocker cabling), which also activate when the temperature of a safe exceeds a certain level as a defense against torches and <b>thermal</b> <b>lances.</b>|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from a Governmental Interdepartmental Group, the Health and Safety Executive {{undertook}} a polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and polychorinated dibenzo-furan (PCDF) sampling exercise at several work sites in the UK. An initial survey suggested potential PCDD/F production at metal recycling sites, during cement manufacture, at munic-ipal waste incinerators and landfill sites and during the use of <b>thermal</b> oxygen <b>lances.</b> PCDD/F sampling, using static and personal air samplers, revealed that the highest PCDD/F exposures were found at metal recycling sites, particularly aluminium recycling sites. The reasons for these results and the possible consequential intakes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper shows {{a finite}} element method (FEM) model to {{calculate}} the temperature distribution of desulphurizing lance use in hot metal pretreatment by ANSYS program. The dynamic temperature distribution under non-linear <b>thermal</b> loads within <b>lance</b> {{in one or more}} duty cycles is obtained. The temperature distribution at important parts of the lance changes with time and is summed up according to the simulation. Some important instructional opinions offered by the conclusion benefit the improvement of temperature-based structure design and mend of desulphurizing lance. In addition, the conclusion provides research data for thermal stress analysis of lance...|$|R

50|$|The {{temperature}} {{at which a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> operates varies depending on the environment. Kosanke gives the maximum temperature to be 8130 F, while Wang calculates it to be 4950 F.|$|E
50|$|In December 1985, the ship's {{stainless}} steel propeller was removed using a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> by Bill, Tony and Bruce Dunne of Caloundra. It was later restored by the Rainbow Beach Business and Tourism Association and then mounted as a monument in the township of Rainbow Beach.|$|E
50|$|A more {{accurate}} {{depiction of a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> in film is in the 1981 Michael Mann movie Thief, in which a real oxygen lance is used to cut a doorway through a real vault door. The only questionable inaccuracies are {{the small number of}} oxygen bottles used, and the absence of breathing gear.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "The Ambush" [...] a Dalek is shown using a device {{resembling}} a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> {{to cut through}} a door. It consists of a long, slim tube flanked by two globes, surmounted by a clear disc-shaped 'sight screen'. This appendage is mounted to the Dalek's arm {{in place of a}} plunger.|$|E
5000|$|The Gimlet Media podcast [...] "Crime Town" [...] {{described}} {{the events of}} the 1973 robbery of the Pease and Curren precious metals refinery near Providence, Rhode Island. Thieves used a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> to break into a vault containing gold and silver. While successful, the lance produced so much smoke that the thieves were forced to open all of the windows and doors in the building and were nearly detected.|$|E
50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>lance,</b> thermic lance, oxygen lance, or burning bar is a {{tool that}} heats and melts steel in the {{presence}} of pressurized oxygen to create the very high temperatures required for cutting. It consists of a long steel tube packed with alloy steel rods, sometimes mixed with aluminium rods to increase the heat output. One end of the tube is placed in a holder and oxygen is fed through the tube.|$|E
50|$|The Baker Street robbery was the {{burglary}} of {{the safe}} deposit boxes at the Baker Street, London branch of Lloyds Bank, {{on the night of}} 11 September 1971.The robbers had rented the leather goods shop Le Sac, two doors north of the bank, and tunnelled a distance of approximately 50 ft passing under the intervening Chicken Inn restaurant. To avoid being overheard, they dug only during weekends. They initially used a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> to try to break into the vault but ultimately had to use explosives.|$|E
50|$|Maya {{comes to}} his rescue {{in the form of}} a space animal which can exist in a vacuum. In the mêlée, Ehrlich's {{spacesuit}} is breached and he must be taken to Moonbase for medical attention. Carter takes off in the moon buggy and Koenig pursues on foot. Carter arrives at the monitoring depot and welds the airlock door shut. He and Bartlett then proceed through the dome's interior to the core access hatch. Not having the security codes to open the massive lead hatch, they use the <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> to cut into its locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Will gets an idea. With Riley's help, they tunnel up {{below the}} bank where the gold was stashed {{and use a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> to melt enough of the gold before their actions are detected. Riley drives off to {{distract}} Harland. Will takes the gold to Vincent at an abandoned amusement park, but Vincent lights the taxi on fire with Alison still inside. Will and Vincent fight, and Will takes a gunshot. He still manages to douse Vincent in gasoline and set him ablaze, giving him time to drive the taxi into a nearby pond.|$|E
50|$|Downing {{gas masks}} and gloves, Kwinto {{and his companions}} {{infiltrate}} into the bank through a ventilation shaft of the restaurant located over it. There they stun security guards, block the alarm with a plate {{that served as the}} necklace clasp, and take out of the safe all money and valued papers. With a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> Nuta cuts through a side wall of the safe an opening, and the group goes away leaving at the crime scene a plate of the necklace. Taking advantage of the owner's absence, the accomplices transport the main portion of the valuables to the Kramer's house.|$|E
50|$|They {{make their}} way to Command Centre, evading the Security forces bent on killing them, and play the white noise recording. It works as expected, and pandemonium erupts when the staff sees the true {{identity}} of their friends and loved ones. Amid the chaos, the aliens suddenly vanish. Koenig knows this is no victory and calls up a picture of the atomic fuel store, where Carter and Ehrlich have cut through the door's lock with a <b>thermal</b> <b>lance.</b> Still under alien control, the two men proceed by moon buggy to the waste domes with the fuel core. Koenig takes Maya and Verdeschi with him in Eagle Five to stop them. Meanwhile, at the waste-dome monitoring depot, Bartlett primes the domes for detonation.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{includes}} multiple historical grace notes. The outlandish {{introduction of}} Michael X's character showing him leading a landlord {{locked in a}} slave collar is not dramatic license but {{is based on a}} similar historical incident. An unremarked passing glance at a photo of John Lennon found in Michael X's safety deposit box is inspired by John Lennon's support for Michael X's [...] "Black house" [...] headquarters depicted in the film, and Lennon posting his bail. A moment of great tension in the film, where the police visit the vault while the robbers are inside, did occur. Not only did the robbers use the spectacular <b>thermal</b> <b>lance</b> shown in the film, but went even further and employed explosives. Contrary to the epilogue, Michael X was not tried and executed for the murder of Gale Benson, but rather for the murder of Joseph Skerritt, another commune member, who was found buried along with Benson. It is also not true that Michael X's personal files are to be kept hidden until 2054.|$|E
