5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he thought <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good.</b> Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E
500|$|When the two {{began working}} on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on {{which he had been}} working and which became [...] "Crash", the album's final single. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> enough {{to be part of that}} history." [...] Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, {{including}} Outkast's André 3000, the Neptunes, and Dr. Dre. Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004, marketing it as a [...] "dance record" [...] and a [...] "guilty pleasure".|$|E
500|$|In early 2003, Stefani began {{embarking on}} {{recording}} sessions for her debut album. After listening to songs recommended {{to her by}} No Doubt bassist and former boyfriend Tony Kanal, she considered recording material that [...] "modernized 1980s music". After writing a series of several songs, including [...] "Serious", [...] "Crash", and [...] "Luxurious", the pair gave up after Stefani didn't find anything worth recording from the sessions. When asked about the aforementioned collaborations, Stefani expressed her doubts {{of whether or not}} her newly recorded material would be any good: [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> enough {{to be part of that}} history." [...] Due to Stefani's doubts, the project began a six-month hiatus, which resulted in the singer deciding to collaborate with various new musicians instead. Stefani's change of heart also ensured her work with Kanal would end up on Love. Angel. Music. Baby..|$|E

500|$|In {{the time}} after Morning Phases release and general {{critical}} success, Beck {{mentioned that he}} had been working on another album at around the same time, but that the new album would be more of a pop record. Shortly after Morning Phases Grammy wins, on June 15, 2015, Beck released the first single titled [...] "Dreams" [...] off this upcoming thirteenth studio album. [...] "I was really trying to make something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to play live," [...] he said shortly after its release. However, no further word was heard from Beck pertaining to the release of the album. On June 2, 2016, almost a year after the initial release of [...] "Dreams," [...] Beck released a new single titled [...] "Wow", along with a lyric video of the song and an announcement that his still untitled album would be released on October 21, 2016. In September 2016, the album was delayed with no new release date announced and, on September 24, Beck said he didn't know [...] "when it’s coming out. It’s probably in a few months." [...] Once again, however, no further singles were released and no new release date was scheduled for the album.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{emerged as}} a {{possible}} candidate to replace Barack Obama, who, after being elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008, officially resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate effective November 16. [...] The class 3 Illinois Senate seat was up for re-election in 2010. [...] Other contenders included Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky, Tammy Duckworth, Emil Jones Jr., Kwame Raoul, Dan Hynes, and Lisa Madigan, while other sources also mentioned Luis Gutierrez and Melissa Bean. One early name mentioned, Valerie Jarrett, withdrew her name from consideration and both Davis and Duckworth noted {{that they had not}} been contacted by the governor's office by the time Obama announced his resignation on November 13, 2008. In a radio interview on the subject, Jackson cited his record on federal funding for his district, loyalty to Obama and diligence in voting in the U.S. House. At the time, Obama was the only black U.S. Senator, and black leaders pressured Blagojevich to appoint a black successor. The Chicago Defender and Southtown Star both endorsed Jackson, who noted that public opinion polls show him as the favorite. The selection was coming {{at a time when the}} Governor's public approval ratings were at an all-time low, which added to the pressure for him to make a selection <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for his own political perception, and it was believed that Jackson's constituency was one that the Governor might need to appease. [...] Although Obama and Duckworth laid a wreath together on Veterans Day, Obama did not endorse a successor. [...] However, in an internal report filed by Obama legal advisor Greg Craig, [...] "Obama authorized Emanuel to pass on the names of four people he considered to be highly qualified to take over his seat – Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes, Illinois Veterans’ Affairs Director Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr." ...|$|E

[...] Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder was not around much for the recording sessions. Vedder {{explained that he was}} [...] "in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem," [...] adding that [...] "leaving the house wasn't the easiest thing to do." [...] Vedder would refer to the issue in the song [...] "Lukin" [...] from Pearl Jam's 1996 album, No Code. Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard said that Mirror Ball [...] "came {{at a time when we}} needed it, that Neil thought we were a band <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made it all right for us to be who we were. He's not taking his career so seriously that he can't take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious." ...|$|E

The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy.
