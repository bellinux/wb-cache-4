40|$|This is an intensive, {{one week}} {{course on the}} {{fundamentals}} of cavitation and its consequences {{in the operation of}} hydropower projects. The course will cover the factors that contribute to cavitation, including turbine design, operation, <b>turbine</b> <b>setting,</b> and other factors such as surface roughness and water quality. The topics to be covered include a review of turbomachinery fundamentals and cavitation principles. The discussion of cavitation principles will include factors leading to cavitation inception such as boundary shape, turbulence, secondary flow patterns, dissolved gas and nuclei content of the water. The features of cavitating flows that lead to erosion, noise and vibration will also be discussed...|$|E

In order to make full use of the wind energy in the high air, based on CFD method, using the commercial software FLUENT and the standard k-ε turbulence model, an axial-flow wind turbine was designed on its structure and simulated with its inner flow field, also the pressure and velocity contours were obtained and the noise evaluation was considered. The results show that for the axial-flow wind <b>turbine,</b> <b>setting</b> the appropriate blade installation angle can be helpful for blade to bear balanced pressure and for air to flow steadly, which offers references to reduce noise and prolong the life of the blade in the industral application...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{flow rate}} {{operation}} of hydroturbines with constant pitch blades causes complex unstable cavitating {{flow in the}} diffuser cone. A particle image velocimetry (PIV) system allows investigating the flow velocity field {{in the case of}} a developing cavitation vortex, the so-called vortex rope, at the outlet of a Francis turbine runner. The synchronization of the PIV flow survey with the rope precession allows applying the ensemble averaging by phase technique to extract both the periodic velocity components and the rope shape. The influence of the <b>turbine</b> <b>setting</b> level on the volume of the cavity rope and its centerline is investigated, providing a physical knowledge about the hydrodynamic complex phenomena involved in the development of the cavitation rope in Francis turbine operating regimes. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2813052 �...|$|E

The aim is to investigate the concentrating of steam impurities in the primary condensate and to increase the reliability of turbine operation by means of decreasing intensity of the corrosive processes by means of the inhibitor. The original design of the sampler for continuous quality control of the primary condensate has been made; the automatic system for continuous metering-out steam solution of the corrosion inhibitor into the <b>turbine</b> <b>setting</b> has been developed. The hydrazine metering-out system has been introduced in the Thermoelectric Plant- 21 of Mosenergo and is introduced in the Thermoelectric Plant- 5 of Omskenergo.

Torque tlow pumps yield to centrifugal pumps in terms of efficiency, but also provide reliable and continuous work throughout the period of operation. To estimate {{the reliability of the}} pump work it is necessary to focus attention on their cavitation qualities. To ensure in reliable continuous operation of the pumps it is requires to estimate numerically the degree of cavitation growth, as well as features of its origin. To perform the calculation it was constructed the computational domain, which consists of a free camera and the impeller. At the initial stage, we calculated the How in free of cavitation mode for single-phase medium using a standard k-r, turbulence model. In the next step we calculated the model of How with cavitation. This calculation is performed {{in a wide range of}} static pressures at the pump inlet. As a result of the calculation, the areas of origin and growth of cavitation were defined in the How part of the torque flow pump at different values of NPSH and the cavitation characteristic of the pump was obtained. The results of numerical studies are confirmed by the physical experiments taking place earlier. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|E
