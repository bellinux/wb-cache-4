5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> {{to black}} was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This {{represented}} the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> to the {{compactness}} of {{the quartet}} {{comes in the}} minuet. The minuet's first half is a standard 12 measures, but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat-side keys. The trio echoes the first and fourth movements by commencing with a B upbeat leading to an E.|$|E

5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> to {{the general}} rule of {{concealment}} and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> was the 1st Division (Commanded by Quiot, {{the leader}} of the 1st Brigade). Its two brigades were formed in a similar manner, but side by side instead of behind one another. This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other (Bourgeois') was to attack {{the eastern side of the}} same post.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{artillery}} time fuzes are {{fitted to}} {{the nose of}} <b>the</b> shell. <b>One</b> <b>exception</b> was <b>the</b> 1950s design US 8-inch nuclear shell (M422) that had a triple-deck mechanical time base fuze.|$|R

5|$|As a {{guide to}} the {{contents}} of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In School Rumble, chapters marked with a sharp sign(♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign(♭). <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.|$|E
5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

50|$|Many {{underground}} military citadels {{have been}} built under London.

5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} pre-defining the {{indicator}} {{setting for the}} day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who {{did not make the}} change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E

The foremost of the infantry were the royal guards, the Immortals, although they were still armed in the aforementioned style. Cavalry was provided by the Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E

25|$|Developments in {{the region}} are {{dependent}} on the terrain and climate, as it is composed mostly of semi-arid plains that cannot support a dense population. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> is the area in and around the Jebal Marra mountains. It was from bases in these mountains that a series of groups expanded to control the region.|$|E
25|$|Geological {{features}} on Iapetus are named after characters and places from the French epic poem The Song of Roland. Examples of names used include the craters Charlemagne and Baligant, {{and the northern}} bright region, Roncevaux Terra. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>exception</b> is Cassini Regio, the dark region of Iapetus, named after the region's discoverer, Giovanni Cassini.|$|E
25|$|After {{the reign}} of Leto II sandworms become un-rideable, for reasons {{elaborated}} above. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> remarkable <b>exception</b> is a young girl named Sheeana, an Atreides-descendant who possesses a unique ability to control the worms and safely move around them.|$|R
50|$|Besides his {{preference}} for non-professional actors, Bresson also liked to cast actors {{he had never}} used before. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> major <b>exception</b> is Jean-Claude Guilbert, who had the rôle of Arnold in Au hasard Balthazar, and plays Arsène in this film.|$|R
