25|$|Interest in {{astronomy}} was evident {{as early as}} 1638 with the initiation of the first American printing press at Harvard College. In 1639 it printed the only American periodical during the seventeenth century, An Almanack Calculated for New England. During the seventeenth century, astronomical almanacs {{began to appear in}} the American colonies, especially New England. These almanacs contained phases of the moon, <b>tide</b> <b>tables,</b> best times to plant, and the setting of religious holidays. They also contained pieces on the celestial sphere.|$|E
25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters {{on a given}} day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in <b>tide</b> <b>tables.</b> Similarly, the two low waters each day are the higher low water and the lower low water. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|E

This approximation presumes that the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is: first hour — 1/12, second — 2/12, third — 3/12, fourth — 3/12, fifth — 2/12, sixth — 1/12.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Hydrographic Service is {{an element}} of the RAN, and serves both {{military}} and civilian functions. The headquarters of the agency is at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales. Hydrographic services provided by the AHS include the mapping and surveying of undersea terrain and irregularities on and under the water's surface (known collectively as hydrography), the provision of nautical charts and other publications, such as <b>tide</b> <b>tables</b> and Notices to Mariners. Over 400 paper charts are produced by the AHS, with conversion of these to electronic navigational chart format due to be completed in 2011.|$|E
25|$|As of August 2006, a {{total of}} 584 Twin Otter {{aircraft}} (all variants) remain in service worldwide. Major operators include: Libyan Arab Airlines (16), Maldivian Air Taxi (22), Trans Maldivian Airways (23), Kenn Borek Air (42) and Scenic Airlines (11). Some 115 airlines operate smaller numbers of the aircraft including Yeti Airlines in Nepal, Malaysia Airlines (which uses the Twin Otter exclusively for passenger and freight transportation to the Kelabit Highlands region in Sarawak), and in the United Kingdom, the FlyBe franchise operator Loganair which uses the aircraft to service the island of Barra in the Hebrides islands. This daily scheduled service is unique as the aircraft lands {{on the beach and}} the schedule is partly influenced by the <b>tide</b> <b>tables.</b> Trials in Barra with heavier planes than the Twin Otter, like the Short 360, failed because they sank in the sand. The Twin Otter is also used for landing at the world's shortest commercial runway on the Caribbean island of Saba, Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
