Ptolemy later used spherical trigonometry to compute <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rising and setting points of the ecliptic, or to take account of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, or he may have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans.

Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house which is a very ancient house. Mary's sister, Cynthia (Ada Ameh) introduces Akin to their father (Chika Okpala) as Mary's boyfriend. Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. He finds it hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia will listen to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf. He tells her that all she needs to do is give the chairman the information on the memory card of his phone. Akin talks to Cynthia and she accepts to behave responsibly at the family meeting and to start behaving responsibly at home in order to preserve the future of her kids. At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E

500|$|Diary of a Camper and {{the films}} that it {{inspired}} were initially called [...] "Quake movies"; the term machinima was later coined in 1998, {{in response to}} the increasing use of other game engines.

However, it's a lot easier to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper". Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as [...] "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment" [...] to separate machinima from its creative lineage. Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines Diary of a Camper as the first machinima work.

Team Ninja founder Tomonobu Itagaki described Ayane's character and personality as much [...] "harder" [...] than Kasumi's, making her fit better in the [...] "very hard-edged" [...] universe of the Ninja Gaiden series.

500|$|James Panero, {{reviewer}} for The New York Times, called Street Gang a [...] "behind {{the lens}} story" [...] and the [...] "first comprehensive account" [...] of Sesame Street. [...] Panero found Davis' history tireless, but objected to Davis' emphasis on unimportant details. [...] As a result, {{and due to}} Davis' inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history, Panero considers the book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative. [...] Other reviewers note that Street Gang is too much like its subject, episodic and unfocused. [...] Diana Wagman of The L.A. Times states that Davis choice of what to focus on is odd; for example, {{there is a great}} deal of focus in the book on <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> licensing and merchandising agreement of the Muppets, but very little attention on Mississippi's 1970 ban of the show. [...] Wagman states, [...] "Yes, we get a little past-tense womanizing, a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in the book, but it all seems sad, not salacious, and not germane to the basic story". [...] Nick Gillespie of The Washington Post agrees. [...] He calls Jim Henson, who is mentioned often in the book, [...] "an almost completely enigmatic character".|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film.

People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. <b>Things</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E
500|$|Wesley Strick was {{initially}} hired to pen a script {{for a new}} Nightmare on Elm Street, after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film Seven; the film was never produced. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production. When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer, and which still [...] "needed to be tinkered with". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into [...] " [...] as a person [...] how he became the thing he was". Bayer expressed that, unlike the Friday the 13th remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the Nightmare remake is coming straight from the first film. At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing Guitar Hero. Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated. To him, if someone watched the film five years later, and Guitar Hero was not as popular as it once was, it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing. At the same time, they wanted the film to feel relevant, and including <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Internet, mobile phones, and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel.|$|E
