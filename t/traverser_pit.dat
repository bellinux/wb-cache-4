5000|$|The geochemical {{properties}} of urban soils {{from more than}} 300 cities in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and America were evaluated. [...] In each settlement samples were collected uniformly throughout the territory, covering residential, industrial, recreational and other urban areas. The sampling was carried out directly from the soil surface and specifically <b>traversed</b> <b>pits,</b> ditches and wells from the upper soil horizon. The number of samples in each locality ranged from 30 to 1000. The published data and the materials kindly provided {{by a number of}} geochemists were also incorporated into the research. Considering the great importance of the defined contents, quantitative and quantitative emission spectral, gravimetric, X-ray fluorescence, and partly neutron activation analyses were carried out in parallel approximately in the samples. In a volume of 3-5% {{of the total number of}} samples, sampling and analyses of the inner and external controls were conducted. Calculation of random errors and systematic errors allowed to consider the sampling and analytical laboratory work as good.|$|R
50|$|Mud bogging {{is a form}} of {{off-road}} motorsport {{popular in}} Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to <b>traverse</b> the <b>pit</b> will determine the winner.|$|R
60|$|This, I say, {{and it is}} {{important}} to note it, was what they knew at half-past seven. Of course as each hour went past they learned more and more. At eight o'clock it was known that Pupkin was not dead, but dangerously wounded in the lungs. At eight-thirty it was known that he was not shot in the lungs, but that the ball had <b>traversed</b> the <b>pit</b> of his stomach.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} claimed by many {{investigators}} {{that there is}} protoplasmic continuity between adjacent ceils in certain botanical forms (3). Characteristic of the organisms which have been claimed to exhibit such connections is the red marine alga C-riffithsia globulifera. Practically all adjacent cells of Griffitksia appear to be connected by broad cytoplasmic strands, the plasmodesmae, which <b>traverse</b> <b>pit</b> cavities in the intercellular junction. It has been proposed that this continuity {{is important in the}} transportation of food material and in conduction of stimuli (3). Other authors have suggested that the intercellular pit cavities are closed by a delicate membrane which permits an easier passage of substances from cell to cell, but that unbroken connections are not to be found (2). All such previous studies have been entirely of a morphological nature and were based on microscopic and histological findings. Recently Curtis and Travis (1) have found positive evidence of a physiological nature indicating protoplasmic continuity between adjacent cells in the Purkinje tissue of the ox heart. The present work is an attempt to obtai...|$|R
5000|$|The {{workshop}} and fitting bays were each 183 by 18 metres in size, with four tracks and three inspection pits. For {{the handling of}} bogies under overhaul there were 24 short <b>traverse</b> tracks and <b>pits.</b> Two 25 tonne cranes were installed in the lifting bay, and two 15 tonne electric cranes were provided in the workshop bay.|$|R
5000|$|Track {{and safety}} crews {{immediately}} descended onto the crash scene to aid Savage. One fire truck, driven by fire/safety truck driver Jerry Flake, was signaled {{to head to}} the scene by Cleon Reynolds, the Chief of the Speedway Fire Department. Flake was stationed {{at the south end of}} the pits, and would have to <b>traverse</b> the <b>pit</b> lane 'against traffic' to reach the Savage crash as quickly as possible. Driving a safety vehicle against the flow of racing and pit traffic was permissible in the USAC safety rules of 1973, and Reynold's hand signal to Flake specifically instructed him to do exactly this. Flake reported [...] "laying on the horn" [...] and slow progress through the pit lane as people were in the way.|$|R
5000|$|The Central Michigan Rugby was {{initially}} established in November 1975. Founded as a Central Michigan University entity, a funding disagreement between the Club and University administration {{resulted in the}} club membership voting to become independent of the university, responsible for attaining their own autonomous funding sources, and become the Mount Pleasant Rugby Football Club on April 17, 1976. The team took on the name [...] "EXILES" [...] because of their new-found status even though {{three quarters of the}} roster was Central Michigan undergrad- and graduate students. The team played both city and university teams across Michigan and southern Ontario as well as [...] "representing Central" [...] as participants in the MAC tournaments at Bowling Green and Athens, Ohio in 1977 and 1978 as well as the Stroh's Great Lakes, Windsor Borderer's, and <b>Traverse</b> Cherry <b>Pit</b> tournaments.|$|R
5000|$|Mud bogging (also {{known as}} mud racing, mud running, mud drags, or mudding) {{is a form}} of {{off-road}} motorsport popular in Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to <b>traverse</b> the <b>pit</b> will determine the winner. Typically, vehicles competing in mud bogs are four-wheel drives. The motor sport is overseen by sanctioning bodies like the American Mud Racing Association, [...] and the National Mud Racing Organization (NMRO), that oversee each class, develop and maintain the relationship with track owners to provide a racer and fan-friendly facility, ensure the sponsors get a good return, and help govern the sport.|$|R
5000|$|The tower {{reaches a}} height of 52 metres, {{making it one of}} the tallest {{buildings}} in the city. It is constructed with a concrete frame, cast in-situ, and clad with pre-cast concrete panels. The slanting aluminium-framed windows protrude outwards at the bottom to aid draught-free ventilation throughout the year. Each floor consists of three leaves of space containing the offices. These are separated by the central lobby and service area, which contains a staircase, lift, and one of the few surviving paternosters in the United Kingdom. The lowest two levels of the tower house a plant room with a boiler that serves half of the entire university campus. Visitors descending on the paternoster must alight at floor 2, otherwise must wait as the compartment <b>traverses</b> the <b>pit</b> and emerges the other side. Travelling [...] "over the top" [...] or [...] "underneath" [...] on the paternoster is considered a rite of passage by many students at the University.|$|R
40|$|Hypervelocity impact (HVI), {{ubiquitous}} in low Earth orbit with an impacting velocity {{in excess of}} 1 km/s, poses an immense threat {{to the safety of}} orbiting spacecraft. Upon penetration of the outer shielding layer of a typical two-layer shielding system, the shattered projectile, together with the jetted materials of the outer shielding material, subsequently impinge the inner shielding layer, to which pitting damage is introduced. The pitting damage includes numerous craters and cracks disorderedly scattered over a wide region. Targeting the quantitative evaluation of this sort of damage (multitudinous damage within a singular inspection region), a characterization strategy, associating linear with nonlinear features of guided ultrasonic waves, is developed. Linear-wise, changes in the signal features in the time domain (e. g., time-of-flight and energy dissipation) are extracted, for detecting gross damage whose characteristic dimensions are comparable to the wavelength of the probing wave; nonlinear-wise, changes in the signal features in the frequency domain (e. g., second harmonic generation), which are proven to be more sensitive than their linear counterparts to small-scale damage, are explored to characterize HVI-induced pitting damage scattered in the inner layer. A numerical simulation, supplemented with experimental validation, quantitatively reveals the accumulation of nonlinearity of the guided waves when the waves <b>traverse</b> the <b>pitting</b> damage, based on which linear and nonlinear damage indices are proposed. A path-based rapid imaging algorithm, in conjunction {{with the use of the}} developed linear and nonlinear indices, is developed, whereby the HVI-induced pitting damage is characterized in images in terms of the probability of occurrence.

40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} an automated method for extracting quantitative measures of foveal morphology from {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) images of the human retina. Methods: A methodological study and retrospective investigation of selected cases. Sixty-five human subjects were included, 61 healthy subjects and four female carriers of blue-cone monochromacy. Thickness data from B scans <b>traversing</b> the foveal <b>pit</b> was fit to a mathematical model designed to capture the contour of the foveal surface. From this model, various metrics of foveal morphology were extracted (pit depth, diameter, and slope). Results: Mathematical descriptions of foveal morphology enabled quantitative and objective evaluation of foveal dimensions from archived OCT data sets. We found large variation {{in all aspects of}} the foveal pit (depth, diameter, and slope). In myopes and BCM carriers, foveal pits were slightly less deep and had a more shallow slope though these differences were not significant. Conclusions: Offline analysis of OCT data sets enables quantitative assessment of foveal morphology. The algorithm works on the Stratus ™ and Cirrus ™ macular thickness protocols, a...|$|R
