5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> {{with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of}} the most significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
25|$|The show {{captured}} a key feature of Britain in the 1960s—the widening generation gap. Alf (and {{to a lesser}} degree his wife) represented the old guard, the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation. Alf's battles with his left-wing son-in-law were not just ideological but generational and cultural. His son-in-law and daughter represented the younger generation. They supported the aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores, fashions, music, etc. The same things were anathema to Alf—and indicative of everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced.|$|E

Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. [...] "He was impulsive... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively so... I think he could not take defeat," [...] San Francisco's assistant fire chief told reporters. White's first campaign manager quit {{in the middle of}} the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an egotist and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press. White's associates and supporters described him [...] "as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge". The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, [...] "Talking to him, I realized that he saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with the world".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his early}} promise, Moore's {{parents had been}} against him {{training}} as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became {{a teacher at the}} school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, [...] "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero." [...] This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, {{in a letter to his}} friend Arthur Sale, that [...] "a year or two after [...] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and wasteful and anti-life.

500|$|Although Shirley {{had been}} removed as commander-in-chief, he {{retained}} the Massachusetts governorship. He expected to lose even that post not long after his return to Boston in August. [...] However, no replacement had yet been named, and Loudoun saw either Shirley's interference or ineffectiveness in all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> on the New York frontier. [...] He also raised detailed questions about Shirley's war-related expenditures, which he (and later historians) concluded was poorly-disguised patronage spending. [...] Loudoun and Shirley argued over many issues, including Shirley's continuance of military preparations after January 1756, when Loudoun's commission was issued. [...] Shirley pointed out that British leadership could hardly expect preparations to cease in the interval between Loudoun's commission and his arrival to take command. [...] While he waited for a replacement to be announced, Shirley took depositions, gathered evidence to support his version of affairs, and worked to close his financial affairs down. [...] (Loudoun was {{of the opinion that}} Shirley delayed his departure intentionally as a political maneuver.) [...] He sailed for England in October 1756. [...] Shirley would be formally replaced by Thomas Pownall in 1757.|$|E
500|$|In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki {{came back}} strong. He {{surprisingly}} led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game high 22 points and commented: [...] "The Slovenians underestimated us. They {{said we were}} the team they wanted and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> you shouldn't {{do that in the}} quarter-finals." [...] Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa's outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: [...] "It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it." [...] Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament's leading scorer (26.7 per game) and second-leading rebounder (10.8 per game) and shot blocker (1.8 per game), and was voted Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out {{towards the end of the}} final, Nowitzki received standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as [...] "one of the best moments of [...] career". In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: [...] "It's tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad." ...|$|E

500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was {{no doubt that he}} had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and {{there was no evidence of}} provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
500|$|The {{derogatory}} {{allusions to}} Cibber in consecutive versions of Pope's mock-heroic Dunciad, from 1728 to 1743, became more elaborate as {{the conflict between}} the two men escalated, until, in {{the final version of the}} poem, Pope crowned Cibber King of Dunces. From being merely one symptom of the artistic decay of Britain, he was transformed into the demigod of stupidity, the true son of the goddess Dulness. Apart from the personal quarrel, Pope had reasons of literary appropriateness for letting Cibber take the place of his first choice of King, Lewis Theobald. Theobald, who had embarrassed Pope by contrasting Pope's impressionistic Shakespeare edition (1725) with Theobald's own scholarly edition (1726), also wrote Whig propaganda for hire, as well as dramatic productions which were to Pope abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and for their [...] "low" [...] pantomime and opera. However, Cibber was an even better King in these respects, more high-profile both as a political opportunist and as the powerful manager of Drury Lane, and with the crowning circumstance that his political allegiances and theatrical successes had gained him the laureateship. To Pope this made him an epitome of all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with British letters. Pope explains in the [...] "Hyper-critics of Ricardus Aristarchus" [...] prefatory to the 1743 Dunciad that Cibber is the perfect hero for a mock-heroic parody, since his Apology exhibits every trait necessary for the inversion of an epic hero. An epic hero must have wisdom, courage, and chivalric love, says Pope, and the perfect hero for an anti-epic therefore should have vanity, impudence, and debauchery. As wisdom, courage, and love combine to create magnanimity in a hero, so vanity, impudence, and debauchery combine to make buffoonery for the satiric hero. His revisions, however, were considered too hasty by later critics who pointed out inconsistent passages that damaged his own poem for the sake of personal vindictiveness.|$|E

2500|$|Pope, however, {{had already}} a quarrel with Theobald. The first mention of Theobald in Pope's {{writings}} is the 1727, Peri Bathos, in Miscellanies, The Last Volume (which {{was the third}} volume), but Pope's attack there shows that Theobald was already a figure of fun. Regardless of the quarrels, though, Theobald was, in a sense, the nearly perfect King of Dunces. [...] The Dunciad's action concerns the gradual sublimation of all arts and letters into Dulness {{by the action of}} hireling authors. Theobald, as a man who had attempted the stage and failed, plagiarised a play, attempted translation and failed {{to such a degree that}} John Dennis referred to him as a [...] "notorious Ideot," [...] attempted subscription translation and failed to produce, and who had just turned his full attention to political attack writing, was an epitome, for Pope, of all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with British letters. Additionally, Pope's goddess of Dulness begins the poem already controlling state poetry, odes, and political writing, so Theobald as King of Dunces is the man who can lead her to control the stage as well. Theobald's writings for John Rich, in particular, are singled out within the Dunciad as abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and their [...] "low" [...] pantomime and opera; they are not the first to bring the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings, but they ferried them over in bulk.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alexandra Fenwick of the Columbia Journalism Review on September 18, 2009, journalist Mark Bowden of The Atlantic said about the case:The young woman and filmmaker who visited those ACORN offices were political activists, and they put together what is, in essence, a very effective political protest against an organization {{they would like to}} damage. And they've done a very effective job of doing that. But I think they're clearly not journalists.The next spring, on March 20, 2010, Clark Hoyt, public editor of The New York Times, wrote an op-ed column conceding some errors in the paper's reporting. ACORN and its supporters had complained [...] "that The Times got the story wrong and, by failing to correct it, has played into the hands of a campaign that has pushed the group near extinction." [...] Hoyt acknowledged that it was by then known that it was not likely that O'Keefe went into the ACORN offices dressed as a pimp, as {{at the beginning and end}} of most of the videos. O'Keefe had presented himself [...] "as a clean-cut young man, sometimes a college student, trying to rescue his girlfriend and under-age girls from an abusive pimp." [...] But, Hoyt wrote:ACORN's supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O'Keefe wore: if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman — sometimes along with under-age girls — in a house where they would work as prostitutes.His article appeared before the release on April 1, 2010, of the California AG Report, which found that O'Keefe's videos had all been heavily edited to misrepresent the ACORN workers and present them in the worst possible light. The pair had set up the workers rather than doing investigative journalism. Investigations by the California AG, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney and the U.S. GAO found that ACORN workers had not participated in criminal activities.|$|E
