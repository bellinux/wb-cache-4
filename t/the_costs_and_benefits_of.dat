5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works (1969), Jules Dupuit {{reported}} that behaviors and cognitions {{can be understood}} from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and {{is the basis for}} determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.|$|E
25|$|Scheele's {{administrative}} skills helped PHS weather two public controversies {{that dominated}} 1950s America: fluoridation of public drinking water supplies and outbreaks of polio that followed a government-sanctioned vaccination campaign.

Following decades of research {{and the success of}} a 1945 clinical trial involving Grand Rapids, Michigan school children, PHS gave formal support to fluoridation as of June 1950, and Scheele issued his public, unqualified recommendation on April 24, 1951, enhancing PHS's public credibility and further elevating the role of the Surgeon General as a spokesperson for health.|$|E
25|$|When V. crabro sexual {{behaviors}} were first studied, the colony {{seemed to be}} under pheromone control by the queen because none of the workers reproduced. However, new evidence has shown that though each of the workers has the machinery to reproduce, they only do so after weighing <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> laying eggs versus the queen laying eggs. In a colony with a queen, the workers are more related to the queen’s larvae than their own. Contrary to previous assumptions, the workers were actually enforcing sterility in one another. Worker policing is the behavior exhibited to prevent other workers within the colony from producing males. This can be completed by either physically destroying worker-laid eggs or by discriminating against those workers that wish to reproduce.|$|E

25|$|Analyzing {{multiple}} {{epidemiological studies}} on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests {{a small but}} measurable increase in risk for bladder cancer at 10 ppb. According to Peter Ravenscroft of the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water. If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since {{it does not include}} lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> arsenic remediation.|$|E
25|$|Given {{conflicting}} evidence of <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> smoking, controversy remains {{on what the}} clinical response to smoking in people with schizophrenia should be. Historically, mental health providers have overlooked smoking in schizophrenia, based on the rationale that patients with serious mental illness already suffer from significant stress and disability and as such {{should be allowed to}} engage in smoking as an activity that is pleasurable though destructive. There is also historical precedent of mental health providers, particularly in patient settings, to use cigarettes as a way to manipulate patient behavior, such as rewarding good behavior with cigarettes or withholding cigarettes to encourage medication compliance. However, research showing that eliminating even one risk factor for disease can significantly improve long-term health outcomes has resulted in the dominant view among clinicians opposing smoking.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits most from the public good. This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E
