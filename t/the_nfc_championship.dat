5|$|In 1995, Favre won {{the first}} of his three AP MVP awards. Favre led the Packers to an 11–5 record, Green Bay's best record in nearly thirty years. Favre passed for a career-high of 4,413yards, 38 touchdowns, and {{recorded}} a quarterback rating of 99.5, which was the highest of his career until he recorded a rating of 107.2 during the 2009 season. Favre also tied an NFL record by passing for at least two touchdowns in twelve consecutive games, a feat he accomplished over the 1994–1995 seasons. The Packers advanced to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game after upsetting the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Game. The Packers lost <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game to the Dallas Cowboys, marking the third year in a row the Packers season was ended by the Cowboys in the playoffs. Favre helped the Packers advance farther in the playoffs than any other Packer team since 1967, which was the season the Packers last won the championship in Super Bowl II.|$|E
5|$|Vikings placekicker Gary Anderson {{had joined}} the team that {{off-season}} after playing for three different teams in his 16-year NFL career. In 1998, {{he became the first}} placekicker in NFL history to convert every field goal and extra point attempted. He finished the regular season 35/35 on field goals, with a long of 53 yards, and 59/59 on extra points. As a result, he was voted to the 1998 NFC Pro Bowl team, the fourth Pro Bowl invitation of his career, and was voted to the AP All-Pro team for the first time. He also converted every field goal and extra point attempt in a Divisional playoff round victory against the Arizona Cardinals the week before <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship.</b> Entering <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, his last miss was on December 15, 1997, against the Denver Broncos, when {{he was a member of}} the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} San Francisco 49–3 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs, then Washington 17–0 in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game. The Giants {{advanced to}} play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in front of 101,063 fans at the Rose Bowl. After falling behind 10–9 at halftime, they came back to beat the Broncos 39–20. Simms was named the game's MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} the third ever conference {{championship}} game to be decided in overtime since the AFL/NFL merger, joining the 1986 AFC Championship Game and <b>the</b> 1998 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game. Tynes joined Rich Karlis and Morten Andersen as the only players to score the decisive points in an overtime conference championship game (coincidentally, all three players {{were members of the}} respective visiting teams in those years). Since, three more <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Games have gone to overtime, with <b>the</b> 2009 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game and <b>the</b> 2011 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game won by the Saints and Giants (Tynes would again kick the game-winning field goal in the 2011 game). Tynes also set a record for longest field goal by an opposing player in Lambeau Field playoff history with his game-winning kick. <b>The</b> first <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game ending in overtime on a touchdown was <b>the</b> 2014 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, won by the Seattle Seahawks.|$|R
50|$|This was <b>the</b> most {{lopsided}} <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> {{game since}} <b>the</b> Giants {{shut out the}} Vikings 41-0 in <b>the</b> 2000 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game. Carolinas 49 points set a new record for most points in an <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} week, the Giants {{defeated the}} Packers 37–20. Manning threw for 330 {{yards and three}} touchdowns, {{two of them to}} wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. This earned the Giants a spot in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game against the San Francisco 49ers. They won that game in overtime, 20–17 with Lawrence Tynes scoring the game-winning field goal as he did four years earlier in the same game against the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{finished}} {{the season with}} an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in the divisional round of the playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive. They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.|$|E
5|$|In {{the playoffs}} the Giants, {{who were the}} top seed in the conference ahead of the Bears, {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers {{for the second consecutive}} year in the playoffs by a score of 49–3. They then disposed of their division rivals, the Washington Redskins, in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game 17–0. In the Super Bowl, behind Simms' 88% pass completion percentage and their strong defense, the Giants overcame a 10–9 halftime deficit and scored thirty second half points while allowing only ten more and defeated the Broncos 39–20.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Bears {{started out}} their post-season with a 27–24 {{win over the}} Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they {{defeated}} the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. Thomas Jones finished {{the game with a}} franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{made his}} first two career starts in week {{seventeen}} and in a wild card playoff game win against the Buccaneers. He did not record any receptions in either game. Against the Chicago Bears in a divisional playoff game win on January 19, Mitchell caught two passes for 14yards. In <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game against the Rams on January 27, Mitchell caught one pass for twoyards. A pass intended for him on a fourth-down play was intercepted by Rams defensive back Aeneas Williams to clinch the win for St. Louis. Mitchell finished the season with 21 receptions for 283yards and one touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The Packers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in a Wild Card Round {{playoff game}} in 1998. Favre had rallied the team with a {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman with 1:56 remaining in the game to put the Packers up 27–23. However, Steve Young responded with a touchdown of his own to wide receiver Terrell Owens with three seconds remaining to end the Packers season. Favre and the Packers failed {{for the first time}} since 1994 to at least reach <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship.</b>|$|E

5|$|The loss of Harris {{to injury}} after the twelfth {{game of the}} season coincided with a decline in {{defensive}} performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9). After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game were held below 21 points.|$|E
5|$|After an offseason of speculation, Favre officially {{signed with}} the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009. He {{would go on to}} have a {{landmark}} season in which he surpassed former Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall for consecutive starts at one position, with 291, became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat every one of the league's 32 franchises since the NFL first expanded to 32 franchises in 2002, surpassed Dan Marino's previous record for four-touchdown games, and was named to his 11th Pro Bowl. The Vikings finished 12-4 and advanced to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game, ultimately losing in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl XLIV champion New Orleans Saints. Despite the loss, Favre set playoff records for pass completions and passing yards previously held by Joe Montana.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E

In <b>the</b> 1981 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game, Joe Montana released the pass over Bethea's stretched arms that Dwight Clark would make [...] "The Catch" [...] on, to propel the San Francisco 49ers to a 28-27 win.|$|R

5|$|Mitchell's most {{significant}} play, according to Philadelphia media and fans, came on January 11, 2004, in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers. Late in the game, with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation, Mitchell caught a 28-yard {{pass for a}} first down. The Eagles tied the score on the same drive and won the game in overtime. Mitchell had another catch for nineyards in the game. In <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers, he caught four passes for 38yards in the loss. Mitchell had 35 catches for 498yards and two touchdowns in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 1998. The {{strength}} of the team during the season was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense continued to struggle. Dave Brown had been released before the season and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. However, neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl-caliber play. Before the 1999 season, the Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins had been the first–ever draft choice of the Carolina Panthers, and in his second season, led them to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game. However, problems with alcohol abuse, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Although many people questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a $16.9 million contract, Accorsi was confident in Collins' abilities.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} final two games {{to secure a}} 13–3 record and a first-round playoff bye as the NFC's #2 seed. They {{defeated}} Chicago 31–3 in the Divisional Playoffs, setting up a rematch with the 49ers in San Francisco for <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship.</b> As they had in Week 13, the Giants' defense held San Francisco's offense in check. In the game's waning moments, nose tackle Erik Howard caused a Roger Craig fumble, and Taylor recovered it. New York drove downfield into San Francisco territory, and on the game's last play, kicker Matt Bahr hit a 42-yard field goal to defeat the 49ers, 15–13.|$|E

50|$|Seventeen {{years to}} the day after their win over the 49ers in <b>the</b> 1990 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, <b>the</b> Giants won <b>the</b> 2007 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game. And {{seventeen}} {{years to the}} day that Matt Bahr kicked the winning field goal to send the Giants to the Super Bowl, Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes did exactly the same thing. New York won its fourth <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game in as many tries, and won their tenth consecutive game away from home.|$|R
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first playoff {{game against the}} Eagles, 20–10, and then {{defeated}} the Vikings 41–0 in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game. They advanced to play the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Though the Giants kept the game close early and went into halftime down only 10–0, the Ravens dominated the second half. The Ravens' defense harassed Kerry Collins all game long, and he {{had one of the}} worst games in Super Bowl history. Collins completed only 15 of 39 passes for 112 yards and four interceptions, and the Ravens won the game, 34–7. The Giants' only score came on a Ron Dixon 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown late in the 3rd quarter. On the ensuing kickoff, the Ravens' Jermaine Lewis scored a touchdown on an 84-yard return.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wild}} card round of the playoffs, the Giants hosted Atlanta Falcons and won 24–2, with the Falcons' only score from a safety due to Eli Manning being flagged for {{grounding}} in the end zone. In the divisional round, the Giants were forced to play the defending champion Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field. The Packers had finished the regular season with a league-best 15-1 record, including a 38-35 win against the Giants in Week 13. In addition, the Packers received a first-round bye, and thus this was their first playoff match. Despite these obstacles, the Giants handily defeated the Packers 37-20 to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game against the San Francisco 49ers. With the score tied 17-17 in regulation, the Giants moved into field goal range in overtime and Lawrence Tynes, {{the hero of the}} 2007 postseason, kicked a 20-yard field goal to send them to Super Bowl XLVI, a rematch against the New England Patriots.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman {{of the year by the}} Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game, losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.|$|E
