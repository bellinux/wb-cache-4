5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (<b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

50|$|The Western Carpathians are an arc shaped {{mountain}} range, {{the northern}} {{branch of the}} Alpine-Himalayan fold and thrust system called the Alpide belt, which evolved during the Alpine orogeny.

5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> southern Ghouta.

In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E

Teachings in both <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>and</b> Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.|$|E

The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E

Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant & the warehouse superintendent; and a cooperage. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> western ends of the Southern Stack.|$|E
5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>and</b> Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed with the Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant policy towards the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with the Jewish people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E
