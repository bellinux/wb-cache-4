Then if all the plots of [...] vs [...] obtained at different times collapse onto a single universal curve then it is said that the systems at different time are similar and it obeys dynamic scaling. The idea of data collapse is deeply rooted to the Buckingham [...] theorem.

Thus, we do not depend on 3 d reconstruction, foreground segmentation, or accurate detections. We extend further ear-lier approaches based on <b>Temporal</b> <b>Self-Similarity</b> Maps by new low-level image features and similarity measures. Gaussian Process classification in combination with Histogram Intersection Kernels serve as powerful tools in our approach. Experiments performed on our new combined multi-view dataset {{as well as on}} the widely used IXMAS dataset show promising and competing results...|$|E

In this paper, we lay out a novel framework for human action recognition based on fuzzy log-polar histograms and <b>temporal</b> <b>self-similarities.</b> At first, a set of reliable keypoints are extracted from a video clip (i.e., action snippet). The local descriptors characterizing the temporal shape variations of action are then obtained by using the <b>temporal</b> <b>self-similarities</b> defined on the fuzzy log-polar histograms. Finally, the SVM classifier is trained on these features to realize the action recognition model. The proposed method is validated on two popular and publicly available action datasets. The results obtained are quite encouraging and show that an accuracy comparable or superior {{to that of the}} state-of-the-art is achievable. Furthermore, the method runs in real time and thus can offer timing guarantees to real-time applications.|$|R

40|$|Retrieving human actions {{from video}} {{databases}} is a paramount but challenging task in computer vision. In this work, we develop such {{a framework for}} robustly recognizing human actions in video sequences. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First a reliable neural model, the Multi-level Sigmoidal Neural Network (MSNN) as a classifier for the task of action recognition is presented. Second we unfold how the temporal shape variations can be accurately captured based on both <b>temporal</b> <b>self-similarities</b> and fuzzy log-polar histograms. When the method is evaluated on the popular KTH dataset, an average recognition rate of 94. 3 % is obtained. Such results {{have the potential to}} compare very favorably to those of other investigators published in the literature. Further the approach is amenable for real-time applications due to its low computational requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} {{involved in}} biological effects of electromagnetic fields have focused {{their attention on}} the analysis of ionic channel gating and on its kinetic behaviour. This {{seems to be a}} potential site of interaction at the microscopic level. Some theoretical models of the response of protein channels to stimulating fields have been developed, based on Markov models. Together with the increasing interest in this subject, a great amount of development of physiological research has resulted from fractal theories and methodologies. Their techniques and approaches have allowed the detection of new properties and characteristics of nature. In this paper, an experimental evaluation of the <b>temporal</b> <b>self-similarity</b> of the acetylcholine channel's current signals and of its spectral properties is made, both for the standard situation and for the channel exposed to microwave fields. On the basis of the theoretical Markov models, a study of these properties was also carried out, demonstrating that a Markov model with a small number of states can simulate some fractal properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a novel stochastic growth process, the Record-driven growth process, which originates {{from the analysis}} of a class of growing networks in a universal limiting regime. Nodes are added one by one to a network, each node possessing a quality. The new incoming node connects to the preexisting node with best quality, that is, with record value for the quality. The emergent structure {{is that of a}} growing network, where groups are formed around record nodes (nodes endowed with the best intrinsic qualities). Special emphasis is put on the statistics of leaders (nodes whose degrees are the largest). The asymptotic probability for a node to be a leader is equal to the Golomb-Dickman constant ω = 0. 624 329 [...] ., which arises in problems of combinatorical nature. This outcome solves the problem of the determination of the record breaking rate for the sequence of correlated inter-record intervals. The process exhibits <b>temporal</b> <b>self-similarity</b> in the late-time regime. Connections with the statistics of the cycles of random permutations, the statistical properties of randomly broken intervals, and the Kesten variable are given...|$|E

We explore self-similarities of action se- quences {{over time and}} observe the striking stability of such measures across views. Building upon this key observation, we develop an action descriptor that captures the structure of temporal similarities and dissimilarities within an action sequence. Despite this <b>temporal</b> <b>self-similarity</b> descriptor not being strictly view-invariant, we provide intuition and experimental validation demonstrating its high stability under view changes. Self-similarity descriptors are also shown stable under performance variations within a class of actions, when individual speed fluctuations are ignored. If required, such fluctuations between two different instances of the same action class can be explicitly recovered with dynamic time warping, as will be demonstrated, to achieve cross-view action synchronization. More central to present work, temporal ordering of local self- similarity descriptors can simply be ignored within a bag-of- features type of approach. Sufficient action discrimination is still retained this way to build a view-independent action recognition system. Interestingly, self-similarities computed from different image features possess similar properties {{and can be used}} in a complementary fashion. Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor multi-view correspondence es- timation. Instead, it relies on weak geometric properties and combines them with machine learning for efficient cross-view action recognition. The method is validated on three public datasets. It has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views only for training...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} spam blog (splog) detection. Blogs are highly popular, new media social {{communication}} mechanisms. The presence of splogs degrades blog search results {{as well as}} wastes network resources. In our approach we exploit unique blog temporal dynamics to detect splogs. There are three key ideas in our splog detection framework. We first represent the blog <b>temporal</b> dynamics using <b>self-similarity</b> matrices defined on the histogram intersection similarity measure of the time, content, and link attributes of posts. Second, we show via a novel visualization that the blog temporal characteristics reveal attribute correlation, depending on type of the blog (normal blogs and splogs). Third, we propose the use of temporal structural properties computed from self-similarity matrices across different attributes. In a splog detector, these novel features are combined with content based features. We extract a content based feature vector {{from different parts of}} the blog – URLs, post content, etc. The dimensionality of the feature vector is reduced by Fisher linear discriminant analysis. We have tested an SVM based splog detector using proposed features on real world datasets, with excellent results (90 % accuracy) ...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing (RS) {{time series}} are an {{excellent}} operative source {{for information about the}} land surface across several scales and different levels of landscape heterogeneity. Ustin and Gamon (2010) proposed the new concept of "optical types" (OT), meaning "optically distinguishable functional types", as a way to better understand remote sensing signals related to the actual functional behavior of species that share common physiognomic forms but differ in functionality. Whereas the OT approach seems to be promising and consistent with ecological theory as a way to monitor vegetation derived from RS, it received little implementation. This work presents a method for implementing the OT concept for efficient monitoring of ecosystems based on RS time series. We propose relying on an ecosystem's repetitive pattern in the <b>temporal</b> domain (<b>self-similarity)</b> to assess its dynamics. Based on this approach, our main hypothesis is that distinct dynamics are intrinsic to a specific OT. Self-similarity level in the temporal domain within a broadleaf forest class was quantitatively assessed using the auto-correlation function (ACF), from statistical time series analysis. A vector comparison classification method, spectral angle mapper, and principal component analysis were used to identify general patterns related to forest dynamics. Phenological metrics derived from MOD IS NDVI time series using the TIMESAT software, together with information from the National Forest Map were used to explain the different dynamics found. Results showed significant and highly stable self-similarity patterns in OTs that corresponded to forests under non-moisture-limited environments with an adaptation strategy based on a strong phenological synchrony with climate seasonality. These forests are characterized by dense closed canopy deciduous forests associated with high productivity and low biodiversity in terms of dominant species. Forests in transitional areas were associated with patterns of less temporal stability probably due to mixtures of different adaptation strategies (i. e., deciduous, marcescent and evergreen species) and higher functional diversity related to climate variability at long and short terms. A less distinct seasonality and even a double season appear in the OT of the broadleaf Mediterranean forest characterized by an open canopy dominated by evergreen-sclerophyllous formations. Within this forest, understory and overstory dynamics maximize functional diversity resulting in contrasting traits adapted to summer drought, winter frosts, and high precipitation variability.
