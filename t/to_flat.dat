5|$|M-56 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the southeastern part of the US state of Michigan. It existed from 1919 until 1957. The highway ran north from Monroe, where it connected with US Highway24 (US24, Telegraph Road), <b>to</b> <b>Flat</b> Rock where it terminated at an intersection with US24/US25. Before a series of truncations in the 1950s, the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and Belleville. The trunkline was progressively scaled back <b>to</b> <b>Flat</b> Rock before being decommissioned in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus, {{and most}} other theropods, {{probably}} primarily processed carcasses with lateral shakes of the head, like crocodilians. The head was not as maneuverable as the skulls of allosauroids, due <b>to</b> <b>flat</b> joints of the neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close <b>to</b> <b>flat),</b> and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|Graphically, F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and {{parallax}} mapping to give textures a {{more realistic}} appearance; the latter is used to {{give the appearance of}} depth <b>to</b> <b>flat</b> bullet hole sprites on walls. Volumetric lighting and lightmapping are included {{with the addition of a}} per-pixel lighting model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level shaders, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.|$|E
5|$|The {{semi-arid}} high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests; {{the region}} has a rolling <b>to</b> <b>flat</b> landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains. Partial plains interrupted by small, sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma; transitional prairie and oak savannahs cover the central portion of the state. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction.|$|E
5|$|Brean Down is a {{promontory}} {{marking the}} eastern end of the bay. Made of carboniferous limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills, and two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. It is owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology, as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest in its own right. It is bounded by steep cliffs and, at its seaward point, Brean Down Fort built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. There is evidence of an Iron Age hill fort, prehistoric barrows, field systems and a pagan shrine. The shrine dating from pre-Roman times was re-established as a Romano-Celtic style temple in the mid-4th century and probably succeeded by a small late-4th century Christian oratory. In 1897, following wireless transmissions from Lavernock Point in Wales <b>to</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm, Guglielmo Marconi moved his equipment to Brean Down and set a new distance record for wireless transmission.|$|E

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited <b>to</b> <b>flat</b> and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing <b>to</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm and which is able to carry up to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island. The work of the Flat Holm Project {{is supported by the}} registered charity the Flat Holm Society.|$|E
5|$|The first 25 were {{constructed}} at Nine Elms Locomotive Works between March and November 1897. Thereafter the M7 class {{had a long}} production run with five major sets of design variants. Between 1897 and 1899 the locomotives {{were constructed}} with a short overhang at the front, and sandboxes combined with the front splashers. Injectors and a lever-type reverser were also added, and a conical, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>flat,</b> smokebox door was implemented on numbers 252–256. In 1900 the design was modified to incorporate the sandboxes inside the smokebox; these were later relocated below the running plate.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close <b>to</b> <b>flat.</b> Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared <b>to</b> <b>flat</b> fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth <b>to</b> <b>flat</b> two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, M-56 was {{assigned}} to roadways that ran northeasterly from the Ohio state line to the Belleville area. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the southern section between the state line and Monroe was redesignated as a section of US25. In the 1940s, the northern end was rerouted north from New Boston to follow M-112 along the Willow Run Expressway (now I-94 {{and part of the}} Detroit Industrial Freeway) into Belleville north to US112. In late 1954 or early 1955, the northern end was changed again, this time truncating the highway to end at New Boston. The northern end was shortened again to terminate at US24/US25 in Flat Rock in 1956. The remainder of the highway from Monroe <b>to</b> <b>Flat</b> Rock was removed and decommissioned from the state highway system the next year, becoming county roads under the jurisdiction of Monroe and Wayne counties.|$|E
