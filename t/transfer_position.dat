5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

It {{is one of the}} oldest professional race teams in the United States, running from 1964-1994; 1997-99; 2001-present. The team won two NASCAR Winston Cup Series races with James Hylton driving, the 1970 Richmond 500 and the 1972 Talladega 500. The team ran for many years in the Winston Cup before closing in 1995. The team was revived in 2007, when Hylton leased a car and a motor from Richard Childress Racing with the intent of becoming the oldest driver to start both the Daytona 500 and a NASCAR race. He then picked up sponsorship from Retirement Living TV. During practice, Hylton turned in a time of 48.150 seconds, which ranked him 15th. During the Duel race, Hylton was in a <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> until on the final restart, he lost 2nd gear and was unable to accelerate, and wound 22nd. Despite not making the race, Hylton stated that he did what he had wanted. His goal was to show that even though he was over 20 years older than any other driver, he could still be competitive.|$|E
50|$|Norm Benning Racing {{opened in}} 1994, DNQ'ing all {{attempts}} by team owner Norm Benning in Cup competition. Benning began fielding the No. 8 and 84 {{car in the}} ARCA Racing Series in 1995 for himself and other drivers. Benning ran the team in four Nationwide races from 2003-2004. The team's most successful series has been the Truck Series, after successfully making 7 of the 8 races they attempted in 2008. The team ran the full Truck season making 24 of the 25 races and finishing 21st in points. Benning once again attempted the Daytona 500 in 2010 but failed to qualify. The team attempted to race the 2010 Truck season full-time in the No. 57 and had a good degree of success, gaining locked-in for a few races in owner points. For 2011 the team struggled to make some races early in the year. Later on the team began fielding a second truck, the No. 75 starting at Iowa. In 2012, the team again had problems with qualifying for some events, but finished 21st in points. In 2013, Benning made all but one race, and gained nattonal notoriety after his battle during the Last Chance Qualifier for the inaugural Mudsummer Classic at Eldora Speedway, barely finishing in the final <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> over Clay Greenfield. Benning finished 20th in points. 2014 saw the team make all 22 races. Midway through the season, Benning changed the number of his primary truck from 57 to 6, a number he used earlier in his career. The teams second truck, the 75, became the 57. 2015 started off on a good note as Benning finished 14th in the season opener at Daytona. Sponsorship problems plagued the team and {{they were forced to}} start and park several events. Towards the end of the season, the effects of starting and parking, plus the reduced number of trucks allowed to make a truck field, saw Benning and team miss 4 of the final 5 races. 2016 was a dismal year for the team, as Benning missed 7 races in the No. 6. Midway through the season, Benning began leasing the points from the No. 63 MB Motorsports team so he could run certain events. 2016 concluded with Benning missing 8 races, making 8 races, and withdrawing from 5. Benning plans to show up for the season opening event at Daytona with the No. 6. After missing the first 3 races, Benning acquired the points from the No.23 GMS Racing truck, allowing his team to be locked into races.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a flexible framework {{to build a}} target-specific, part-based representation for arbitrary articulated or rigid objects. The aim is to successfully track the target object in 2 D, through multiple scales and occlusions. This is realized by employing a hierarchical, iterative optimization process on the proposed representation of structure and appearance. Therefore, each rigid part of an object is described by a hierarchical spring system represented by an attributed graph pyramid. Hierarchical spring systems encode the spatial relationships of the features (attributes of the graph pyramid) describing the parts and enforce them by spring-like behavior during tracking. Articulation points connecting {{the parts of the}} object allow to <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> information from reliable to ambiguous parts. Tracking is done in an iterative process by combining the hypotheses of simple trackers with the hypotheses extracted from the hierarchical spring systems...|$|E

40|$|Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT) is an assisted reproductive technique {{that can produce}} multiple copies of excellent livestock. However, low cloning efficiency limits the application of SCNT. In this study, we systematically investigated the major influencing factors related to the overall cloning efficiency in pigs. Here, 13620 cloned embryos derived from excellent pigs were transferred into 79 surrogate gilts, and 119 live cloned piglets were eventually generated. During cloning, group of cloned embryos derived from excellent Landrace or Large white pigs presented no significant differences of cleavage and blastocyst rates, blastocyst cell numbers, surrogate pregnancy and delivery rates, average numbers of piglets born and alive and cloning efficiencies, and group of 101 - 150, 151 - 200 or 201 - 250 cloned embryos transferred per surrogate also displayed a similar developmental efficiency. When estrus stage of surrogate gilts was compared, group of embryo transfer on Day 2 of estrus showed significantly higher pregnancy rate, delivery rate, average number of piglets born, average alive piglet number or cloning efficiency than group on Day 1, Day 3, Day 4 or Day 5, respectively (P< 0. 05). And, {{in comparison with the}} preovulation and postovulation groups, group of surrogate gilts during periovulation displayed a significantly higher overall cloning efficiency (P< 0. 05). Further investigation of surrogate estrus stage and ovulation status displayed that ovulation status was the real factor underlying estrus stage to determine the overall cloning efficiency. And more, follicle puncture for preovulation, not <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> shallowed for preovulation or deepened for postovulation, significantly improved the average number of piglets alive and cloning efficiency (P< 0. 05).

The objective of both techniques is to correctly transfer the GP {{of an earlier}} sight for the run.

An application of celestial RFT is the iterative least-squares (LSQ) program, which incorporates celestial RFT and is then denoted as LSQ*. The other transfer technique, called GD-UT, refers to the <b>transfer</b> of the <b>position</b> circle of an earlier sight by transferring its GP for the run data.

40|$|Here {{we propose}} a general {{relativistic}} quantum framework for cryptography that exploits the fascinating connection of quantum non-locality and special {{theory of relativity}} with cryptography. The underlying principle of unconditional security is causality and two-fold quantum non-local correlations: first entanglement swapping and then teleportation over causally independent entangled systems. We show that the proposed framework has following remarkable and novel features in mistrustful cryptography: (i) It helps in defining a new notion of oblivious transfer where both the data transferred and the <b>transfer</b> <b>position</b> remains oblivious. (ii) The authenticity and integrity of the data transferred is guaranteed by the fundamental principles of quantum theory instead of computational complexity. (iii) It directly leads to unconditionally secure and deterministic two-sided two-party computation which is currently considered to be impossible.
