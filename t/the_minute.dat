40|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> {{of trials}} {{are one of}} the crucial parts of the Polish penal and civil law procedure, rarely does the legal theory draw its {{attention}} to the arbitrariness of the data contained in <b>the</b> <b>minutes.</b> Using <b>the</b> approach of the ethnomethodologists, it is worth looking at the process of preparing <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> (protocoling) as at a sui generis cultural construct, which frames the data for trials. Minutes, supposed to express the witness’ speech, are appreciated more by the legislator than the witness’ writing. However, according to the legal theory, not all of the elements of a speech shall be written down. What is more, in practice, not all of the elements of a protocol, which are recommended by theorists, are present in protocols. The language written in <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> differs from <b>the</b> language of oral expression in the trial.

5000|$|Usually, one of {{the first}} items in an order of {{business}} or an agenda for a meeting is the reading and approval of <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> from <b>the</b> previous meeting.

If there are significant errors or omissions, then <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> may be redrafted and submitted again at a later date. Minor changes may be made immediately using the normal amendment procedures, and <b>the</b> amended <b>minutes</b> may be approved [...] "as amended". It is normally appropriate to send a draft copy of <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> to all <b>the</b> members in advance of the meeting so that the meeting is not delayed by a reading of the draft.|$|R

5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to <b>the</b> <b>minute,</b> actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues.

LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, a {{trend has}} {{developed}} (particularly with Association football fans) to fill <b>the</b> traditional <b>minute</b> of silence with {{a minute of}} applause which {{has long been a}} custom in Italy. Psychologically this is seen by some to celebrate the deceased person's life rather than mourn his/her death. Recent recipients of <b>the</b> <b>minute's</b> applause include deceased footballers Jock Stein, George Best, Ernie Cooksey, and Alan Ball. It is frequently alleged that the predominant reason for <b>the</b> <b>minute's</b> applause tending to replace <b>the</b> <b>minute's</b> silence is out of fear that opposition fans will not respect the silence, and spend their time booing, jeering, or otherwise attempting to disrupt it; many silences have been cut short from <b>the</b> usual <b>minute</b> to thirty seconds or less for this reason.|$|R
