There has come through a reform of public administration in the Czech Republic not long ago, which transferred a part of execution of state administration to municipalities. Thesis summarizes legal basis on which this process is realized. It also describes typology of municipalities {{and the extent of}} its <b>transferred</b> <b>competence.</b> Main part of this thesis is focused on analysis of transferred competency financing. Object of the thesis is to prove or to disprove an idea that the municipalities have to use their own funds to finance the execution of the state administration...|$|E

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis competence transfers in Belgium: {{an analysis of}} the fifth state reform of 2001  answers the following three research questions: (1) How does a <b>transfer</b> of <b>competences</b> take place? (2) What is the outcome of such a <b>transfer</b> of <b>competences?</b> (3) And which characteristics of a <b>transfer</b> of <b>competences</b> {{have an effect on the}} outcome of this <b>competence</b> <b>transfer?</b> The analysis focuses on the fifth Belgian state reform of 2001. More in particular, four <b>competence</b> <b>transfers</b> from the federal to the Flemish level are analyzed: agriculture, foreign trade, local and provincial governments, and development cooperation. The empirical data on those case studies is based on extensive document analysis and on interviews with administrative, political and social key players and with concerned Flemish and federal civil servants. Three important conclusions are presented in this {{doctoral thesis}}. Firstly, it is clear that the <b>competence</b> <b>transfers</b> in the four policy areas vary to a large extent regarding their history and regarding the way the agenda setting, the policy formulation, the decision making and the implementation took place. Secondly, also a large degree of variation in the outcome of <b>competence</b> <b>transfers</b> is found. <b>Transfers</b> of <b>competences</b> are fully, partially or even not at all executed, which generates its specific organizational consequences for the concerned administrations. Finally, the case studies show that the outcome of a <b>competence</b> <b>transfer</b> is mainly determined by the political rules of the game that are typical of consociational decision-making, as well as by the political support during the implementation phase. Remarkably, it has become clear that the concerned administrations do not play a significant role in the process that determines whether a <b>competence</b> <b>transfer</b> is executed or not. However, these administrations can have an important impact on the speed and quality of the execution of the <b>competence</b> <b>transfer.</b> This doctoral thesis theoretically contributes to the literature by arguing that change needs to be considered as a dynamic political and administrative process in which one phase gradually flows into another and in which returning to earlier policy steps is the rule rather than the exception. As far as its policy-relevance is concerned, the thesis contribution is the fact it demonstrates that consociational decision-making sometimes leads to non-execution through the use of incremental decision-making techniques such as working groups and cooperation agreements. A second policy-relevant finding is that the administrations that have a high degree of technical knowledge could take a proactive stance regarding the development of a state reform, both in the delivery of knowledge regarding practical feasibility, as in the preparation of their organization for change. Finally, arguing that a political agreement is not always a guarantee for implementation, this doctoral thesis shows that the sixth state reform still has a long way to go, even with the conclusion of the institutional agreement of October 2011. nrpages: 314 status: publishe...|$|R

Aiming at {{different}} kinds of transverse joints of common concrete pavements, this paper puts forward oblique-reinforced transverse prestressed continuous concrete pavement, and compares it with other reinforcement types of continuous pavements in their mechanical and deformation behaviors {{under the influence of}} temperature drop. Analysis results show that oblique-reinforced transverse prestressed concrete pavement could take advantage of deformation <b>transfer</b> <b>competence</b> of oblique steels, and while applying prestressing force on slab along transverse direction, longitudinal prestressing force appears which would effectively counteract temperature shrinkage stress along driving direction.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the changes in}} the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice according the Lisbon Treaty, especially the Police and Justice Cooperation in criminal matters. The three pillar structure is replaced and the competences in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice are increased and provisions transferred in the Treaty on Functioning of the European Union and within the ambit of the Court of Justice’s jurisdiction. Criminal law is an issue of particular sensibility. On one side, criminal law provisions seriously endanger individual rights, and on the other side, criminal law provisions reflect the basic values of society and therefore are reserved for national legislations. However, this traditional understanding of criminal law is not appropriate to the EU integration level. Having in mind these issues, member-states <b>transferred</b> several <b>competences</b> to the European Union in order to undertake measures in the area of criminal law, criminal procedure and cooperation in criminal matters. However, the principle of <b>transferred</b> <b>competences,</b> respect of domestic criminal justice and basic principles of proportionality and subsidiarity request careful use of these competences...|$|R
40|$|Translation, {{as defined}} by many scholars, is a message-transferring process from one {{language}} or source language (SL) into another language or target language (TL). Thus, {{it refers to the}} process that a translator does in conveying the messages which is also called a decision-making process. It means a translator must decide the words s/he is going to use in translation activity, because a word might have more than one equivalents; one word might represent more than one meaning. To produce an accurate, acceptable, and readable translation, a translator must have one of translation <b>competences</b> called <b>transfer</b> <b>competence.</b> This competence cannot be fulfilled by translation machine like Google translation and any other translation tools because a machine does not have linguistic sense as translators do.

40|$|The {{implications}} of the recent institutional crisis in the EU provoked {{by the failure of}} the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) to impose the sanctions on Germany and France provided for in the Stability and Growth Pact are the subject of this Working Document. The paper situates the debate concerning the application of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in a broader evolution of the struggle between two schools of thought concerning macroeconomic policy-making in the EU: the school calling for a strengthening of competences at the EU level (federal economic government) and the school arguing for preserving national competences for budgetary policy {{even in the face of}} the <b>transfer</b> of <b>competence</b> for monetary policy to the European Central Bank (ECB). The paper argues that the SGP is an acceptable comprise between the two schools in so far as it establishes rules to be respected without actually <b>transferring</b> <b>competence</b> to the Council in the field of budgetary policy. Consequently, the SGP has not and does not add to the ‘democratic deficit’ within the EU institutional framework. The paper argues, nevertheless, that the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) puts too strong an emphasis on the government budget deficit and suggests that emphasis on the sustainable level of public debt would ensure a stronger basis for assessing whether a given budget deficit may be considered excessive or not...|$|R

An overall framework for supply chain knowledge management is developed, along with literature-based definitions of supply chain knowledge <b>transfer,</b> <b>competence</b> and maturity constructs. The "knowledge lens" theory building approach is applied to import these perspectives into supply chain domains, with efforts to maintain conceptual consistency across the two literature streams.

This methodology relies on activities contrasting with those communicative practices that have become the rule in the area of teaching language and cultures, such as translation, contrastive grammar, the importance of writing. The methodological common denominator is that of a plurilingual and pluricultural pedagogy. Learning French thus opens a door to a range of romance languages spoken by more than 500 million people throughout the world. For French-speakers, intercomprehension represents a means of rapid access to related languages and cultures, at the same time encouraging reflexive observation of the first language. The practice of intercomprehension educates for plurilingualism. It targets {{the development of a new}} relationship with languages, by means of an active practice of observation, which makes it possible to justify the acquisition of partial competencies in a language as a valid goal for learning...|$|R

40|$|More than 10 {{years after}} the Amsterdam Treaty, which <b>transferred</b> <b>competences</b> on {{immigration}} and asylum matters to common jurisdiction, the EU Commission is asking for a “genuine” European immigration policy. In our view, such a genuine policy must consider the common control of immigration flows, unequivocally rejected by both the Amsterdam and Lisbon Treaty {{for reasons that are}} rooted in the political terrain and—in terms of the economic logic—in the difficulty of finding a common immigration model. We consider that the focal point is constituted by whether or not to create side-payments, without which States {{have no choice but to}} adopt a national immigration policy. Side-payments, at this stage in the history of the European Union, would be very difficult to determine in the context of immigration policy. The fact that immigration policy is assigned to national governments, rendering compensatory payments impossible, is rooted in the complexity of this politically sensitive issue as well as in the practical difficulty of calculating the positive and negative externalities referred to above...|$|R

40|$|Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) has {{recently}} been recognised as the world’s most efficient and customer focused privatised airport. Studying the corporate strategies and knowledge management issues faced by a company as successful as BAC holds important insights. This paper discusses four key characteristics which impact on BAC’s knowledge management strategy: First, corporate values are embedded in a strong culture that is built upon ‘win/win’ outcomes, operational flexibility, and consultative management. These values drive BAC’s strategy of maintaining a slim core, outsourcing, relationships building, and committing to shared risks and returns. BAC faces challenges of growth, exercise of influence on more with fewer, migration from control to culture, and migration from a value chain driven airport to a self-sustaining economic city. Second, BAC is exploratory by nature. An explorer meets new challenges afresh, is innovative, fluid, and populated by experienced and expert people who generate a constant flow of new ideas. Third, there is an increasing need to systematically capture and <b>transfer</b> <b>competences</b> across {{more people in the}} slim core.
