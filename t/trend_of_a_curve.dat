We aimed {{to evaluate the}} feasibility and safety of PPFT placement in children, using an electromagnetic (EM) guided system as a rescue strategy in case unguided tube insertion fails. In a single-center prospective study, we included all the children (weight > 2. 5 kg) in whom unguided PPFT placement failed between 2009 and 2012. EM guided PPFT placement was attempted before regular fluoroscopic and endoscopic placement was attempted, respectively. Forty-nine children were included (mean age 3. 5 years). EM guided PPFT placement was successful in 82 % of the children. No adverse events occurred. Age or indication for the PPFT did not influence the success rate <b>of</b> the procedure. <b>A</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> learning <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> 25 patients was noticed. Costs of EM placement were slightly {{higher than those of}} fluoroscopic placement in our hospital setting. With enough expertise, EM guided PPFT placement seems safe and can prevent fluoroscopic or endoscopic tube placement in 82 % of childre...|$|R
