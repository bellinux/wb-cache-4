25|$|A truss can {{be thought}} of as a beam where the web {{consists}} of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the bottom chord) and the upper horizontal member (the <b>top</b> <b>chord)</b> carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the bottom chord is in tension, and the <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> in compression.|$|E
25|$|Its pin-connected {{superstructure}} uses {{wrought iron}} Phoenix columns in its <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> and compression members. The end posts and upper chord {{are made up}} of six flanged cast elements riveted together. The intermediate verticals and lateral struts have four apiece.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to carrying the static forces, the members serve additional functions of stabilizing each other, preventing buckling. In the adjacent picture, the <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> is prevented from buckling {{by the presence}} of bracing and by the stiffness of the web members.|$|E
50|$|Longspan and Deep Longspan Steel Joists can be {{furnished}} with either underslung or square ends, with parallel chords or with single or double pitched <b>top</b> <b>chords</b> to provide sufficient slope for roof drainage. Square end joists are primarily intended for bottom chord bearing.|$|R
30|$|Since the {{developed}} analysis procedure considers linear-elastic behavior for the <b>top</b> and compression <b>chords,</b> {{the developed}} analysis procedure should be adequately modified to more precisely evaluate shear strength of reinforced concrete beams exhibiting yielding of main longitudinal rebars or crushing of <b>top</b> compression <b>chord.</b>|$|R

500|$|Inglis was due {{to retire}} from the {{university}} in 1940, but was persuaded to remain for another three years so that John Baker could be appointed in his stead. [...] Interest in Inglis' army bridge was rekindled in the Second World War and the Mark III design introduced in 1940. [...] Inglis applied for a United States patent for the particular type of triangular trusses used in his bridge in 1940; which was approved and granted in 1943. [...] Testing of a prototype of the Mark III revealed a weakness in the <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> of the truss and the subsequent redesign complicated the production process. [...] Whilst the bridge was produced in limited quantities from 1940 it was largely replaced by the Bailey bridge, introduced in 1941, a fact that disappointed Inglis. [...] The Inglis design remained in service for some time owing {{to a lack of}} resources for production of the Bailey bridge and saw service in rear areas and with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division.|$|E
2500|$|This [...] {{shows the}} removal and barge loading process. This [...] (both from the pghbridges.com site) shows a truss loaded on the barge and being moved. The <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> has been {{disassembled}} to allow clearance of some bridges it must pass under.|$|E
2500|$|Workers made a pontoon out of {{two pairs}} of barges, spaced to create a {{platform}} [...] long and [...] wide, which carried the bridge with [...] of overhang. Stringers supported the bridge in forty-two places, with a 40-ton screw jack at each stringer for easier loading and unloading. When workers reached the Manchester Bridge, they had to adjust the bridge to fit the clearance, which was [...] and [...] less than the bridge’s height. After supporting the bridge under the floor beams, they disassembled the <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> and stabilized each panel point on the trusses. Steering the bridge under the Manchester Bridge and the railroad bridge at Brunot's Island, the tugboat captains went through the Ohio River lock and up the back channel toward Coraopolis, where piers and abutments had been constructed.|$|E
25|$|A planar truss is {{one where}} all members and nodes lie within a two {{dimensional}} plane, while a space truss has members and nodes that extend into three dimensions. The top beams in a truss are called <b>top</b> <b>chords</b> and are typically in compression, the bottom beams are called bottom chords, and are typically in tension. The interior beams are called webs, and the areas inside the webs are called panels.|$|R
25|$|The 1892 Sixth Street Bridge (as {{described}} above, {{a pair of}} camelback Pratt trusses and {{the third}} bridge built in this location) had a second chance. In 1927, it was lowered from its piers, the <b>top</b> <b>chords</b> partially disassembled. The structure was floated downriver to a new location over the Ohio River back channel between Coraopolis and Neville Island {{to make way for}} the current Sixth Street Bridge structure.|$|R
50|$|A {{scissors}} truss {{is a kind}} of truss {{used primarily}} in buildings, in which the bottom chord members cross each other, connecting to the angled <b>top</b> <b>chords</b> at a point intermediate on the top chords' length, creating an appearance similar to an opened pair of scissors. Scissors trusses are used almost entirely in building construction to support a pitched roof, where a sloping or raised ceiling surface is desired.|$|R
2500|$|The two spans are {{lenticular}} trusses {{with the}} <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, while the bottom chord comprises {{a pair of}} chains. Each of the trusses is simply supported and therefore no horizontal thrust is exerted on the piers, which is crucial {{in view of the}} curved track on either side. Between these two chords are supporting cross-bracing members and suspension standards which hang beneath the bottom chord to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam. There are also seventeen much shorter and more conventional plate-girder approach spans on the shore. On the Cornish side there are ten which measure (from Saltash station towards the river): , , , , , , , , , , and seven on the Devon side of (from the river towards St Budeaux): , , , , , , [...] This gives a total length for the nineteen spans of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Gertie, whose {{preassembled}} deck {{sections were}} first raised into {{place at the}} center of the main span and the ends of the sidespans, on the new bridge the stiffening truss was erected first at each tower, and then progressed outwards. Four work crews, one on each side span and two on the main span (one each side) worked together completing each step in [...] intervals (completing an average of [...] of steelwork per day). The side span crews worked towards shore and the main span crews worked towards each other, and by May 1949, work was nearing completion. On May 28, ironworkers installed the closing <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> on the main span, and over the next two days workers finished closing the span up. On June 1, the steel stiffening truss of the road deck was declared complete.|$|E
50|$|The roof framing {{consists}} of king post trusses {{with a double}} <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> (or <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> and rafter). This type of king post truss is rare but other examples have been noted in {{such as in the}} 1714 Lynnfield, Massachusetts meeting house, 1800 Congregational Church in Windham, Vermont, and the 1799 Strafford, Vermont meeting house.|$|E

50|$|The Springfield Bridge is a {{historic}} bowstring arch bridge, spanning Cadron Creek in rural Faulkner County, Arkansas, United States. It is east of Springfield, and a short way south of the Springfield Road bridge. It is 188 ft long, set on stone abutments, with tubular metal <b>top</b> <b>chords</b> that rise 15 ft above the bottom chords. Built circa 1871-74, it is the oldest documented highway bridge {{in the state and}} its only documented bowstring arch bridge.|$|R

50|$|The East Bloomsburg Bridge was {{constructed}} with Pennsylvania-style trusses, {{also known as}} Petit trusses. These {{were based on a}} Pratt truss, but had several modifications. These included converting the <b>top</b> <b>chord</b> to a polygonal shape and dividing and deepening the panels.|$|E

50|$|The 1889 wrought-iron spans were {{fabricated}} in Geelong at the Humble and Nicholson Vulcan Foundry and comprise two double-intersection deck-trusses, {{connected by}} iron cross bracing, and {{seated on the}} 1856 abutments of red sandstone. These abutments were originally made for a timber truss superstructure, which lasted only 33 years. The timber deck has a single layer of longitudinal planking on timber cross beams, which are bolted to the flanges of the truss <b>top</b> <b>chords.</b> The single span is 29 metres long with a deck 6.1 metres wide, later widened to 7.3 metres. The wrought-iron lattice-girder trusses are of unusually light construction.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{dimensional}} lumber joists {{have their}} limitations {{due to the}} limits of what farmed lumber can provide. Engineered wood products such as I-joists gain strength from expanding the overall depth of the joist, as well as by providing high-quality engineered wood for both the bottom and the <b>top</b> <b>chords</b> of the joist. A common saying regarding structural design is that [...] "deeper is cheaper", referring to the more cost-effective design of a given structure by using deeper but more expensive joists, because fewer joists are needed and longer spans are achieved, which more than makes up for the added cost of deeper joists.|$|R
50|$|Besides fracturing, some bridges with {{critical}} non-redundant parts {{can also}} suddenly fail from buckling of compressive members (the opposite of cracking of tensile members). In through-truss bridges the critical compressive parts are the top-chord beams running horizontally {{along the top}} of the bridge, parallel to the roadway edges. They carry most of the weight of the bridge and traffic. The chords are normally kept aligned and held in place by vertical posts, diagonals, and sideways sway struts. <b>Top</b> <b>chords</b> will quickly fold if their joints somehow become misaligned. Buckling damage is cumulative, but mostly happens from collision damage or overstresses rather than from age and corrosion.|$|R
5000|$|A tied-arch {{bridge is}} an arch bridge {{in which the}} outward-directed {{horizontal}} forces of the arch, or <b>top</b> <b>chord,</b> are borne as tension by the bottom chord (either tie-rods or the deck itself), {{rather than by the}} ground or the bridge foundations.|$|E

50|$|These {{inflexible}} arched truss {{were used}} in wooden railroad bridges across the US and Canada in the 19th century. After {{his work at the}} New York and Erie Railroad, in 1858 McCallum founded the McCallum Bridge Company in Cincinnati. The company specialized in railroad bridges, which they build in the Western and Southern States. Some of the Howe truss men were so impressed by McCallum's business success (if not by his arguments) that they began arching their <b>top</b> <b>chords,</b> and a notable example of this practice was the Rock Island Bridge over the Mississippi River. The advent of steel bridges in the 1860s effectively made obsolete his unique design.|$|R
5000|$|Liegender Stuhl is a truss of German origin, the German name {{is used in}} America.
