5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> middle-class whites weary {{of the civil rights movement}} in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} {{that men have}} been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as they usually do. Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ken Dryden awarded the album 4 stars, stating: [...] "Like many pianists, Steve Kuhn seems {{to put out}} one quality disc after another but doesn't ever seem <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> he deserves. This beautifully {{recorded}} studio date from 1968, with bassist Palle Danielsson and drummer Jon Christensen, is a good example".|$|R

[...] The four will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Pollock and Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while Savage will continue production duties at the band's Chem19 Studios in Hamilton and in a new studio.|$|R
50|$|Tora {{agreed that}} he had led his villagers astray, but insisted {{that he had}} done so only with a view <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of <b>the</b> Military and the Great Council of Chiefs, to hasten the {{appointment}} of Ratu Josefa Iloilo to the Presidency. He told the court through his lawyer that as {{he was the one who}} had led his villagers to commit the offence, he wished to bear the full brunt of the law, and hoped that his fellow-accused would be dealt with leniently.|$|R
25|$|In Germany, Bangladeshi expatriates, Germans and {{citizens}} from other European countries met in Frankfurt and Bonn protested {{the lack of}} results in the double murder investigation.

A human chain was formed around the UN building in Bonn.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{have called}} for {{immediate}} changes {{in the music industry}} regarding the level of loudness. In August 2006, the vice-president of A for One Haven Music, a Sony Music company, in an open letter decrying the loudness war, claimed that mastering engineers are being forced against their will or are preemptively making releases louder <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> industry heads. Some bands are being petitioned by the public to re-release their music with less distortion.|$|E
25|$|Emergency – An Emergency {{is issued}} when {{an event that}} by itself cannot {{pose a threat to}} life or property, but may {{indirectly}} cause other events to happen that may pose a threat to life or property. An example of this would be a power outage, which although not directly posing a hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services. The only existing exceptions to this are the tornado emergency and flash flood emergency, which are issued <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the public to a major tornado or flash flood.|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} in late 2008, also to promote the album, but it failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same <b>attention</b> as <b>the</b> previous single. This single was also released in Amazon.com and iTunes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason why}} Rihanna {{wanted to run}} this format just in the United Kingdom and {{especially}} in London, she told in {{the introduction of the}} first episode. She said that in London the [...] "children of the street" [...] have a unique street style, which can/has inspired numerous designers. Because these people can't show their talent easily, Rihanna wanted to give them a chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> they deserve. With the format also the candidates who have not managed in the show could eventually establish themselves independently in the fashion world through the hype and <b>the</b> media <b>attention.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sunny Winslow is Dawns {{best friend}} in California. Her mother is {{suffering}} (and eventually dies) from lung cancer, and her father works {{all the time in}} his bookstore to avoid his pain, so he doesnt pay much attention to her. Sunnys rebellious behavior and negative attitude towards her friends are the main sources of conflict throughout the series, though Sunnys diaries reveal that shes acting out <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> she desires from her parents. She runs away from home in her first diary. In her third diary, her mother dies, leading Sunny to finally reconcile with her friends.|$|R
25|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine emperor Maurice (r. 582–602), Khosrow II went to Syria, {{and sent}} a message to the Sasanian {{occupied}} city of Martyropolis to stop their resistance against the Byzantines, but with no avail. He then {{sent a message to}} Maurice, and requested his help to regain the Sasanian throne, which the Byzantine emperor agreed with; in return, the Byzantines would re-gain sovereignty over the cities of Amida, Carrhae, Dara and Miyafariqin. Furthermore, Persia was required to cease intervening in the affairs of Iberia and Armenia, effectively ceding control of Lazistan to the Byzantines.|$|E
25|$|The Muppet Show is a family-oriented comedy-variety {{television}} series that {{was produced by}} puppeteer Jim Henson and features The Muppets. After two pilot episodes produced in 1974 and 1975 failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> network executives in the United States, Lew Grade approached Henson to produce the programme in the United Kingdom for ATV. The show lasted for five series consisting of 120 episodes which were first broadcast in Britain between 5 September 1976 and 15 March 1981 on ATV and was shown by the other ITV franchises in the United Kingdom. The programs were recorded at Elstree Studios, England.|$|E
25|$|When a For Sale sign {{appeared}} on a property including his favorite landscape, Walker became an activist. After trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> local officials, Walker took matters into his own hands. He began leading hikes into the area, presenting slide shows of the landscape, and having participants write postcards to government leaders asking for their support. He also brought his photos and slides to the Park District headquarters, interesting the staff and allying himself with local officials who would later hire him {{for a variety of}} projects. Eventually, the area was preserved as the first addition to Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in more than a decade.|$|E

The group, {{who had long}} been with Motown Records, had joined Atlantic after failing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> they wanted. It {{was the start of}} a hugely {{successful}} collaboration that lasted for seven years and eight original albums. Bell revitalized the group, producing five gold albums that included chart success with singles such as [...] "Mighty Love," [...] "Ghetto Child", [...] "I'll Be Around", [...] "Could It Be I'm Falling in Love", and [...] "The Rubberband Man". In 1975, he was awarded a Grammy for Best Producer of the Year.|$|R

25|$|After {{the ordeal}} he then {{discovered}} the land seized {{from him to}} make a highway was actually not used. By 2002 Qian began petitioning in Fuzhou and Beijing's government offices. Unable to find redress, he reportedly taught himself to use the internet, and cultivate a presence on various blogging platforms, hoping <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> human rights defenders, academics, lawyers, reporters, and police. Not only did Qian fail to elicit the attention of anyone who might help him, but he became aware of other individuals who had similarly had their homes demolished. In one of his blog he accused Linchuan district party cadre of embezzling 10 million yuan in compensation funds after demolishing his house and that of seven other families. Qian had two sons and one daughter.|$|E
25|$|The return {{fire from}} Fort Clark was ineffectual, either falling short or passing overhead, and no hits {{were made on}} the bombarding ships. Shortly after noon, the {{defenders}} ran low on ammunition, and about 12:25p.m. they ran out completely. At this point, they abandoned the fort, some fleeing to Fort Hatteras, while others took to boats. Col. Max Weber, commanding the Federal troops already on shore, noted this and put some men in to take possession, but the fleet did not know this and continued firing for another five minutes. It was during this interval of confusion that the landing force suffered its only casualty, {{one of the soldiers}} being seriously wounded in the hand by a shell fragment. Fortunately, some of the troops were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the gunners on the ships by waving a large American flag, and the bombardment stopped with no further harm done. Stringham and his captains then turned their attention to Fort Hatteras.|$|E

40|$|Non-verbal {{invitation}} by an embodied agent The {{ability of}} an embodied conversational agent {{to start the}} initial contact with a human with non-verbal behavior is {{one step closer to}} a more natural human agent conversation. Four different agent implementations are presented with <b>the</b> goal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> and <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of people by using the gaze and the smile. The associated results that are found while these agents were placed in an environment are shown. One of the agents was capable of keeping people interested longer. Another result was the surprising amount of provoking and aggressive behavior people showed towards the agents. More research is needed however to copy a believable human non-verbal invitation...|$|R
50|$|Effectively, {{if there}} is no {{solution}} to a problem, it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> political <b>attention.</b> There can be a wonderful idea in the air, but if this is not answering any prominent problem, no political attention will be raised. Finally, there can be a political will to solve a problem, but if no solution is available, nothing will happen. Political will comes from both predictable elements such as post-elections and unpredictable ones like natural disasters. The three flux must encounter in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> political <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> use an available solution to solve an existing problem. Individual policy entrepreneurs are needed to build acceptance for solutions and to create couplings between these streams of problems, solutions, and political will.|$|R
500|$|The Boston Globes Renée Graham {{wrote of}} the artists' ambivalence towards the term in a 2003 article on neo soul's standing, [...] "Despite its {{critical}} success, if neo-soul had an initial failing, it was the media-created label itself – a term that the artists, whom {{it was meant to}} represent, generally rejected". In a 2003 interview, music publicist John Constanza said that [...] "The neo-soul movement is still there, but it's been underground, and it's trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the mainstream again". Mark Edward Nero of About.com stated, [...] "In general, neo-soul has remained almost exclusive to R outlets such as urban radio and Black Entertainment Television [...] the majority of neo-soul artists have yet to crossover to mainstream American music listeners, partially because the music's sound generally focuses on artist expression, rather than popular appeal".|$|E
500|$|Protest {{organizers}} {{knew they}} would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: [...] "My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South." [...] He headed the planning {{of what he called}} Project C, which stood for [...] "confrontation". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.|$|E
500|$|The {{recreation}} {{was done}} to line up two points in the fourth dimension, time, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the person playing Ever 17; the characters see the player as a 4th-dimensional being, [...] "Blick Winkel", who can move through time; Blick Winkel appearing was what caused Hokuto's amnesia. Yubiseiharukana tells Blick Winkel that they had told her to do the recreation to save Takeshi and Coco. Blick Winkel travels to 2017, and wakes up Takeshi on the seafloor, forcing him to swim to IBF; inside, he injects Coco with Tsugumi's antibodies. Blick Winkel warns Yubiseiharukana in 2017 to not save Takeshi and Coco immediately, to avoid a time paradox; instead, Blick Winkel has Takeshi and Coco enter cryogenic suspension in IBF. They wake up in 2034, saved. Sora, who now has a robotic body, is given back her memories from the disk, and Yubiseiharukana leaks information about Leiblich, exposing them as the ones behind the Tief Blau outbreak.|$|E

5000|$|Ed Hogan of AllMusic {{said the}} song's [...] "dominant, looping rhythm echoes the tick-tock of a clock, {{which gives the}} down-tempo track a melancholy late-night vibe, {{emphasizing}} {{the feeling that the}} singer is giving his all in a one last chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> direct <b>attention</b> of <b>the</b> object of his affectations." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fan voting has {{increased}} {{criticism of the}} Pro Bowl. Voting by fans makes up 1/3 of the vote for Pro Bowl players. Some teams earn more selections of their players because fans often vote for their favorite team and not necessarily the best player. In the 2008 Pro Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys had thirteen players on the NFC roster, an NFL record. [...] "If you're in a small market, no one really <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> see you play", said Minnesota Vikings cornerback Antoine Winfield, who {{spent much of his}} early career with the small-market Buffalo Bills. [...] "If you're a quiet guy, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention.</b> You just have to work hard and play."

500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Teams {{are only}} able to request an instant replay {{challenge}} by tossing their red flag <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> officials.
