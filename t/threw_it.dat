5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> over 60% of {{the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> 10.1% {{of the time}}. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E

5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|Before Wilhelm, the knuckleball was {{primarily}} mixed in to older pitchers' repertoires {{at the end}} of their careers to offset their slowing fastballs and to reduce stress on their arms, thereby extending their careers. Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> nearly every pitch. The New York Times linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2009, Bradley {{signed a}} three-year, $30 million {{deal with the}} Chicago Cubs. He was issued a two-game {{suspension}} for supposedly making contact with umpire Larry Vanover while arguing a strike call on April 16, which was reduced to one game on appeal. During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly in right field and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> into the stands, believing {{it was the third}} out of the inning when there were only two outs. The umpire allowed each of the Twins' baserunners to advance two bases as a result.|$|E

5|$|Promotional {{activities}} halted after G-Dragon {{tested positive}} for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E
5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E

5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when he tossed a lateral to Andrew Brewer who <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Phil Boersma {{opened the}} scoring for Liverpool in the 20th minute {{when he was}} first to reach the loose ball that had been blocked by David Harvey from a shot by Keegan. Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry with the decision because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt as he left the field and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> away. Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E

5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off her skirt and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
5|$|CMLL held {{a tournament}} to {{determine}} the next CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion starting on January 22, 2013, and the finals were held the following week. The {{first round of the}} tournament was a 16-man torneo cibernetico elimination match, with the last two men in the match qualifying for the finals the following week on January 29. The torneo featured two teams of eight wrestling against each other; Team A consisted of Delta, El Felino, La Máscara, Mephisto, Mr. Águila, Rey Escorpión, Stuka Jr. and Volador Jr. and Team B consisted of Atlantis, Blue Panther, Diamante, Euforia, Maximo, Morphosis, Psicosis and Sagrado. The match came down to Team A's Rey Escorpión and Volado Jr. versus Team B's Euforia. Escorpión pulled off Volador Jr.'s mask and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> to rival Euforia, causing Euforia to be disqualified, which meant that Escorpión and Volador Jr. qualified for the finals the following week. On January 29, Rey Escorpión defeated Volador Jr. in the finals to become the 13th overall CMLL World Light Heavyweight champion.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 1959, Musial was {{the batter}} {{in one of}} the oddest plays in {{baseball}} history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling {{all the way to the}} backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. The North Vietnamese forces lost 49.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
