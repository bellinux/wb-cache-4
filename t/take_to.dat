However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to capture Constantinople in 717–718, the Umayyads for a time {{diverted}} their attention elsewhere, allowing the Byzantines to <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the offensive, making some gains in Armenia. From 720/721 however the Arab armies resumed their expeditions against Byzantine Anatolia, although now {{they were no longer}} aimed at conquest, but rather large-scale raids, plundering and devastating the countryside and only occasionally attacking forts or major settlements.|$|E

5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances.

When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene.

At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers.

5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they <b>take</b> <b>to</b> a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} <b>take</b> <b>to</b> double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, hunting was {{restricted}} to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years it would <b>take</b> <b>to</b> reach a formal agreement.|$|E

5|$|At 03:13, U-156 {{attacked}} the Texaco-owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach {{next to the}} Arend/Eagle Refinery. Just one of the torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties. Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men to <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun forgot to remove the tampion from the barrel, so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire, the gun blew up. Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the 3.7cm flak gun to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.|$|E
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely.
