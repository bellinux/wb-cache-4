5|$|<b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>of</b> the Imperial Roman army were {{professionals}} who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves.

In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those who had fought and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. With the passing of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>of</b> the First World War.|$|E
