5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|Perry is the pet platypus of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is {{perceived}} as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life {{as a member of}} an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii and North Dakota. He engages in daily battles with Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, an evil scientist who desires to take over the Tri-state area with obscure contraptions that work perfectly according to his intended function but fail in his application of them every time.|$|E

25|$|Bailey {{was born}} in Bath, Somerset, {{and spent most of}} his {{childhood}} in Keynsham, a town situated between Bath and Bristol in the West of England. His father was a medical practitioner and his mother a hospital ward sister. His maternal grandparents lived in an annexe, built on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> by his maternal grandfather who was a stonemason and builder. Two rooms {{at the front of the}} family house were for his father's surgery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the Breton War of Succession (1341–64), the defeated faction led by Olivier de Blois, Count of Penthièvre, continued to plot against the Dukes of the House of Montfort. The Blois faction, who still refused to relinquish {{their claim to}} rule over the Duchy of Brittany, had taken Duke John VI prisoner {{in violation of the}} Treaty of Guérande (1365). The sixteen-year-old Gilles took <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Montfort. Rais was able to secure the Duke's release, and was rewarded with generous land grants which were converted to monetary gifts.|$|E
25|$|Ashfield, {{the next}} {{house on the}} same side, was {{occupied}} during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In {{the early part of}} the 19th century it became the home of Sir William Cusac Smith, Baron of the Exchequer and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd. occupied it until about twenty years ago when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and named Brookvale after the last occupants.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} Hathorn, a native of today's Delaware, {{had been on the}} {{surveying}} team that established the present land border between New York and New Jersey, which had been the subject of a lengthy conflict between the two colonies for much of the 18th century. He settled in Warwick and opened a store and iron forge in 1770, and built the house after marrying Elizabeth Welling, daughter of his local host, in 1772. The inscription of their initials and the year of construction in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is a tradition more commonly associated with Germanic building traditions, a sign of how influential settlers of that background were in the Hudson Valley.|$|E
25|$|The reader learns a {{great deal}} about what the family was like from how the robots {{continue}} on in their functions. Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, but no one is there. Robotic mice vacuum the home and tidy up. As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed. By the next morning, the entire house has collapsed except for one wall that announces the date over and over.|$|E
25|$|The 1858 OS shows two {{buildings}} on the site, very {{close to each other}} but not physically connected. One building probably being the old Laigh Chapelton Farm and the other, on the right, being the residence built for James McAlister. The photograph (Davis 1991) seems to be of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> facing onto the road and the Chapel Hill. The 1851 OS shows formal gardens with a boundary wall, paths and a central feature, possibly a pond. The 1897 OS shows one large building with wings and extensions which appear to be porches and possibly a conservatory. By this date the formal gardens are absent, as in the 1911 OS. The ha-ha is not shown in the large scale map of 1897 OS, but appears to be present in the 1858 and the 1911 editions. No footbridge can be made out, however the OS maps have a number of errors and omissions, especially the exact outlines of buildings which are often only 'approximations'. Between 1858 and 1897 a main driveway has been constructed into the grounds from nearly opposite the Chapel Hill and a formal path with steps leads from the position of today's main entrance down to Chapelton House.|$|E

2500|$|The present chapel {{was founded}} by Robert Chatfeild [...] of nearby Streat, who was born and baptised in Ditchling in 1675. [...] In 1730, he took {{copyhold}} tenure of the land next to the 1672 cottage off East End Lane.

[...] (Evershed, an important figure in Sussex Nonconformism, later founded Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel). [...] Chatfeild's son, Robert junior, acquired the freehold {{of the land in}} 1740; he passed it to the trustees of the chapel, who were said in 1901 to have [...] "a singularly open trust deed ... when the number of trustees are reduced to five they are required to choose 12 more to act with them, the property to be applied to such charitable uses as [...] think most proper".|$|E
2500|$|Nilsen's murders {{were first}} {{discovered}} by a Dyno-Rod employee named Michael Cattran, {{who responded to}} the complaints made by both Dennis Nilsen and other tenants of 23 Cranley Gardens regarding the drains of the property being blocked on 8 February 1983. Opening a drain cover at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Cattran discovered the drain was packed with a flesh-like substance and numerous small bones of unknown origin. Cattran reported his suspicions to his supervisor, Gary Wheeler. However, as he had arrived at the property at dusk, Cattran and his supervisor agreed to postpone further investigation into the blockage until the following morning. Prior to leaving the property, Nilsen and a fellow tenant named Jim Allcock convened with Cattran to discuss the source of the substance. Upon hearing Cattran exclaim how similar the substance was in appearance to human flesh, Nilsen replied: [...] "It looks to me like someone has been flushing down their Kentucky Fried Chicken." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{was constructed}} amid towering elm trees, from hand-hewn lumber on a fieldstone foundation {{and finished with}} masonry stucco and lath work. Its architectural features included pine and wood pegged floors, walnut window trims, a main floor ceiling over three metres (10 feet) in height, a low-pitched gabled roof, a gingerbread trim-styled front veranda {{as well as a}} bathtub and shower equipped washroom fitted to an attic or ceiling level rainfall cistern —installed by the younger Bell at a time when few homes in the region had any fixed bathtubs at all. [...] Its shower and oversized bathtub (likely chosen for the younger Alexander's large frame) drew hot and cold water from piping leading to both a ceiling level cistern and to a hot water heater in the basement. The home's layout featured a central hallway plan and its ten rooms included a large kitchen, large dining room, parlour, study plus four bedrooms on its upper floor. A greenhouse conservatory with a workroom at its rear were also added by the Bells to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> off of its parlour.
