40|$|A steel disc is cut using {{a single}} point tool. The {{coefficient}} of friction of the nascent cut surface is measured by a spherical steel pin situated in close proximity of the point of cutting. The <b>tool,</b> <b>disc</b> and the friction pin are immersed in an oil in water emulsion bath during the experiment. The purpose of the experiments conducted here is to record the effect of hydrophilic/lypophilic balance (HLB) of the emulsifier on the lubricity experienced in the cutting operation. The more lypophilic emulsifiers were found to give greater lubricity than what is recorded when the emulsifier is more hydrophilic. XPS and FTIR spectroscopy are used to explore the tribofilm generated on the nascent cut surface to indicate a possible rationale for the effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Modified {{design of}} a planter to be {{attached}} to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this project. This research project {{was part of a}} larger project, called “Developing robotics assisted technology for farming”. The main motivation for this research project is the fact that mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed. Besides, it should require less draft force compared to existing planters so that it can be pulled by the mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding. To find the forces between soil engagement <b>tool</b> (<b>disc</b> coulter) and soil, experiments were designed and performed in the Linear Soil Bin at University of Saskatchewan. Disc and tilt angle of a disc coulter was changed and draft, vertical and side forces applied to it were measured to find the disc and tilt angle combinations that results in minimum draft force. Experiments showed that 7 ° disc angle and 25 ° tilt angle provides the least draft force compared to other disc angle and tilt angle combinations. Then, using the knowledge obtained from literature and the soil bin experiments, a planter was designed conceptually and in detail, based on the existing CNH planter. For further analyses computer modeling was performed. The whole planter was modeled in 3 D, using SolidWorks. Stress analysis was performed in ANSYS Workbench to calculate safety factor of the designed parts. Two prototypes were fabricated and were attached to the mobile robot for field tests. Tests were performed in indoor settings to measure the total draft force required to pull developed planters. Draft force was very close to the value that was calculated in design stage. Results showed that an average of 460 N pulling force is required to pull one row planter for 50 mm depth of cut, which can be compared to n existing CNH corn planter that requires a pulling force of between 900 N to 1300 N. Seed drop accuracy and function of the developed planters in opening and closing a packed soil in presence of residue, were also observed in outdoor tests...|$|E

Two 1. 4 m long billets were cut from each tree and were rotary veneered in a spindleless lathe {{down to a}} 45 mm diameter core to expose knots which were classified as either alive, partially occluded or fully occluded. Non-destructive evaluation of {{a wider range of}} thinning treatments available in these trials was undertaken with Pilodyn and Fakopp <b>tools.</b> <b>Disc</b> samples were also taken for basic density and modulus of elasticity. Differences between treatments for all wood property assessments were generally small and not significantly different. Thinning and pruning had little effect on the stem diameter growth required to achieve occlusion, therefore occlusion would be more rapid after thinning due to more rapid stem diameter growth. The difference between the treatments of greatest management interest, thinned and pruned (T&P) and unthinned and unpruned (UT&UP) were small. The production of higher value clear wood produced after all knots had occluded, measured as the average stem diameter growth over occlusion of the three outermost knots, was approximately 2 centimetres diameter. Two of the treatments can be ruled out as viable management alternatives: (i) the effect of thinning without pruning (T&UP) is clear, leading to a large inner core of stem wood containing knots (large knotty core diameter) and (ii) pruning without thinning (UT&P) results in a small knotty core diameter, however the tree and therefore log diameters are also small...|$|R

Disc geometry {{is one of the most}} important factors to be considered in evaluating the soil reaction acting upon a <b>disc</b> <b>tool.</b> A theoretical analysis of the disc geometry was therefore carried out.

40|$|The main {{direction}} {{of reducing the}} cost of soil treatment based on resource-saving technologies is the transition to surface treatment of soil with disk tools. Double-row and four-row <b>disc</b> <b>tools</b> are manufactured. Four-row tools significantly increase tillage intensity. In the disk <b>tools,</b> the spherical <b>disc</b> is fixed on the individual pole. Disc headers are equipped with a rigid adjustment fixing the standalone pole to the frame. Recommended operating speed is up to 12 km/h. The advantage of a disc header over the disc harrow is as follows: winding plant residues on the axis are excluded. Disc mulchers are equipped with a spiral bar on which a spherical disk is mounted. The presence of the elastic element allows the working unit to do lowfrequency oscillations during movement. The result of processing is the formation of mulch in the layer of soil, which {{is a mixture of}} plant residues and soil particles with a diameter of up to 25 mm. To assess the effectiveness of the disc mulcher and the disc header a unit is composed. The initial data for calculation are as follows: tractor HTZ- 150 K, the resistivity of the soil is 6 kN/m, disk tool working width is 4 m, operating speed of the disc header is 12 km/h, operating speed of the disc mulcher is 15 km/h. Technical and economic performance of these units is defined during disking the soil. The choice of energy-saving operating regime was made in a well-known manner.

"December 2012 "Monitoring tool displacement during a milling process allows the operator to identify when there is relative movement between the cutting tool and the workpiece. When the relative movement between the cutting tool and the workpiece becomes large enough, the displacements of the cutting tool become known as chatter. Chatter produces a dimensionally inaccurate cut, poor surface finish, tool breakage, and is the main obstacle in high speed milling. If the milling machine or operator were able to detect the smaller tool displacements leading up to chatter, then the milling operation can be altered to eliminate the onset of chatter. A new tool design to measure tool displacement during milling operations is presented and validated in this research. The concept behind this new tool design is to indirectly measure the tool's displacement in the x and y direction by attaching a thin disc perpendicular to the neck of the cutting <b>tool.</b> The <b>disc</b> will allow sensors to measure the angle of deflection in the neck of the cutting tool by measuring the resulting tilt in the disc. Measuring the disc's displacement rather than the actual tool's displacement allows for the sensors to be placed above the cutting tool and away from milling operations...|$|R

One of the main goals is to explore the diagnostic power of various gas emission lines and line ratios for deriving main disc parameters such as the gas mass. Methods: We explored the results of the DENT grid (Disk Evolution with Neat Theory) that consists of 300 000 disc models with 11 free parameters. Through a statistical analysis, we searched for correlations and trends in an effort to find <b>tools</b> for <b>disc</b> diagnostic. Results: All calculated quantities like species masses, temperatures, continuum, and line fluxes differ by several orders of magnitude across the entire parameter space. The broad distribution of these quantities as a function of input parameters shows the limitation of using a prototype T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be disc model. The statistical analysis of the DENT grid shows that CO gas is rarely the dominant carbon reservoir in discs. Models with large inner radii (10 times the dust condensation radius) and/or shallow surface density gradients lack massive gas-phase water reservoirs. Also, 60 % of the discs have gas temperatures averaged over the oxygen mass in the range between 15 and 70 K; the average gas temperatures for CO and O differ by less than a factor two. Our study of the observational diagnostics shows that the [C ii] 158 μm fine structure line flux is very sensitive to the stellar UV flux and presence of a UV excess, and that it traces the outer disc radius (Rout).

One of the main goals is to explore the diagnostic power of various gas emission lines and line ratios for deriving main disc parameters such as the gas mass. Methods. We explored the results of the DENT grid (Disk Evolution with Neat Theory) that consists of 300 000 disc models with 11 free parameters. Through a statistical analysis, we searched for correlations and trends in an effort to find <b>tools</b> for <b>disc</b> diagnostic. Results. All calculated quantities like species masses, temperatures, continuum, and line fluxes differ by several orders of magnitude across the entire parameter space. The broad distribution of these quantities as a function of input parameters shows the limitation of using a prototype T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be disc model. The statistical analysis of the DENT grid shows that CO gas is rarely the dominant carbon reservoir in discs. Models with large inner radii (10 times the dust condensation radius) and/or shallow surface density gradients lack massive gas-phase water reservoirs. Also, 60 % of the discs have gas temperatures averaged over the oxygen mass in the range between 15 and 70 K; the average gas temperatures for CO and O differ by less than a factor two. Our study of the observational diagnostics shows that the [C II] 158 mu m fine structure line flux is very sensitive to the stellar UV flux and presence of a UV excess, and that it traces the outer disc radius (R-out). In the submm, the CO low J rotational lines also trace R-out. Low [O I] 63 / 145 line ratios (Conclusions. The [O I] 63 /CO 2 - 1 line ratio is a powerful diagnostic for breaking disc modelling degeneracies. A combination of the [O I] 63 mu m flux and the [O I] 63 /CO 2 - 1 line ratio can be used for M-ga...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies relating to optimization of kinematics and consumables during chemical mechanical planarization processes. These are also evaluated with the purpose of minimizing environmental and cost of ownership impacts. In order to study diamond micro-wear and substrate wear during planarization processes, {{a series of}} static etch tests and wear tests were performed using different types of diamond discs and subjected to various treatments. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Membrane Spectroscopy (ICPMS) were used to estimate the extent of diamond micro-wear and substrate wear. Next, the impact of various factors (type of slurry abrasive, pH, abrasive content and abrasive concentration) on pad wear rate during planarization process was studied. Another study in this dissertation focuses on the development of a novel technique of using coefficient of friction (COF) data to distinguish between good and bad diamond discs. This study made use of the innovative <b>tool</b> diamond <b>disc</b> dragging device (DDD- 100) designed and developed {{for the purpose of this}} study. It is known that the performance of chemical mechanical planarization depends significantly on the polishing pad grooving type and the kinematics involved in the process. Variations in pad grooving type as well as pressure and sliding velocity can affect polishing performance. One study in this dissertation investigates the effect of pressure and sliding velocity on the polishing performance. The study is conducted on multiple pressure and sliding velocity variations to understand the characteristic of each condition. A subsequent study focuses on the impact of pad grooving type on polishing performance. The greatest contribution of this dissertation involves development of the novel slurry injector to optimize the utilization of slurry during planarization processes. Slurry is a critical component in chemical mechanical planarization processes and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the cost of ownership (CoO). The novel injector apart from reducing the consumption of slurry, also contributed in addressing problems associated with foaming, reduced the number of defects and achieved better within wafer non-uniformity (WIWNU) ...|$|R
40|$|During operation, {{hot working}} tools are {{subjected}} to thermal, mechanical and tribological stress. This results in high abrasive and adhesive wear, which limits the tools' lifetime. The lifetime can be prolonged by appropriate surface treatments. This paper describes investigations on the combination of laser alloying or laser dispersing with a nitriding process. The target has been to increase the life time of hot working tools, more precisely of forging tools. Samples and selected forging tools were laser alloyed/dispersed {{in order to reduce}} the abrasive wear. The samples were subsequently nitrided to decrease the adhesive wear. The effect of this duplex treatment of surfaces was determined via the evaluation of each single process as well as their combination. Two special testing devices were developed to simulate the wear on hot working <b>tools.</b> A modified <b>disc</b> on disc test apparatus was especially suited to simulate thermal shock and mechanical wear of duplex treated hot working tool steels. By this, information on the properties and quality of the described duplex treatment was obtained within a few hours, instead of a long term testing period under real service conditions. Investigations using standard metallographic methods and micro hardness testing as well as microanalysis have been performed in addition...|$|R
40|$|DISC 1 (disrupted in schizophrenia- 1) gene is {{associated}} with several neuropsychiatric disorders as it is disrupted by a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 11 in a large Scottish pedigree with high prevalence of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. Since its identification, several mouse models with DISC 1 genetic modifications have been generated using different approaches. Interestingly, a natural deletion of 25 bp in the 129 mouse alters the DISC 1 gene reading frame leading to a premature stop codon {{very close to the}} gene breakpoint in the mutant allele of the Scottish family. In the present study we confirmed that the 129 DISC 1 Del mutation results in reduced level of full length DISC 1 in hippocampus of heterozygous mice and we have characterized the behavioral consequences of heterozygous 129 DISC 1 Del mutation in a mixed B 6129 genetic background. We found alterations in spontaneous locomotor activity (hyperactivity in males and hypoactivity in females), deficits in pre-pulse inhibition and also increased despair behavior in heterozygous 129 DISC 1 Del mice, thus reproducing typical behaviors associated to psychiatric disorders. Since this mouse strain is widely and commercially available, we propose it as an amenable <b>tool</b> to study <b>DISC</b> 1 -related biochemical alterations and psychiatric behaviors...|$|R
