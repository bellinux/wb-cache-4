5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He saw no reason <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over to someone {{who had not been}} involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777). His leg wound left Arnold bedridden for five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over to the British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andre led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne's right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Grand Fleet was dissolved, and Benbow was {{assigned}} to the 4th Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, where she served until March 1926. In 1919, Captain Charles Douglas Carpendale took command of the ship, a position he held until 1921. During this period, from April 1919 to June 1920, the ship took part in anti-communist operations in the Black Sea. Benbow and other elements of the Mediterranean Fleet supported the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. In late January 1920, Benbow was sent from Constantinople to Novorossiysk. There, the ship relieved Iron Duke, and shortly thereafter rescued a group of 150 Russian soldiers and their British adviser, who had been attacked by bandits. On 1 February, Rear Admiral Michael Culme-Seymour hoisted his flag aboard Benbow. Shortly thereafter, men from the ship were sent to inspect White positions in the Kerch Peninsula. Benbow was ordered to return to Constantinople in June, where the Mediterranean Fleet was concentrating to begin supporting Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War; she arrived there on 19 June. On 5 July, Benbow and several other vessels left Constantinople to land a force at Gemlik to secure the harbor in order <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over to Greek forces that would arrive later. Benbows men returned to the ship on 16 July after a Greek battalion reached the town.|$|E

He tells Sharon that he would provide for Raymond and Aaron and pay off debts if he accepted. Ben signs the paperwork for the garage when Phil decides <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> {{over to him and}} Sharon is left stunned when he decides to give Jay the car lot land as it is worth more than the garage. Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about giving Jay the car lot land. Ben finds a solicitor's letter of Phil's that mentions Raymond and after confronting Phil, Phil tells Ben that Raymond is his half-brother. Ben is angry with Phil for making him feel second best to his and Sharon's other children. Jay attempts to confront Phil about why he is receiving the car lot and Phil admits he killed his biological father who was the homeless man who died in the car lot fire when Phil torched it 23 years previously in an insurance scam. Phil then reveals this to be a lie in a mysterious phone call. Billy confronts Phil over his actions and ends up punching him. Later, Phil is knocked unconscious when the exposed gas line explodes during the Walford in Bloom event, but he is unharmed.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 12th century the castle was {{controlled}} by the royal castellan, Simon de Beauchamp, the son of Hugh de Beauchamp who had helped conquer England in 1066. Contemporaries described the castle around this time as [...] "completely ramparted around with an immense earthen bank and ditch, girt about with a wall strong and high, strengthened with a strong and unshakeable keep". Simon died in 1137, and King Stephen agreed that Simon's daughter should marry Hugh the Pauper and that the castle would be given to Hugh, in exchange for Stephen giving Miles compensatory honours and gifts. Miles and Payn de Beauchamp, the children of Simon's brother, Robert de Beauchamp, declared that the castle was rightfully Miles' and refused <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over to Hugh.|$|E

[...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – I can understand why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E

The Gazette said, [...] "You've got <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation.

500|$|Ever {{since the}} {{official}} unveiling of the bust in Berlin in 1924, the Egyptian authorities have been demanding its return to Egypt. In 1925, Egypt threatened to ban German excavations in Egypt unless Nefertiti was returned. In 1929, Egypt offered to exchange other artifacts for Nefertiti, but Germany declined. In the 1950s, Egypt again tried to initiate negotiations {{but there was}} no response from Germany. Although Germany had previously strongly opposed the repatriation, in 1933 Hermann Göring considered returning the bust to King Farouk Fouad of Egypt as a political gesture. Hitler opposed the idea, and told the Egyptian government that he would build a new Egyptian museum for Nefertiti: [...] "In the middle, this wonder, Nefertiti, will be [...] enthroned, ... I will never relinquish the [...] head of the Queen." [...] While the bust was under American control, Egypt requested the United States <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over; the USA refused and advised Egypt to take up the matter with the new German authorities. In 1989, the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak viewed the bust and announced that Nefertiti was [...] "the best ambassador for Egypt" [...] in Berlin.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant, Jean was asked about her reaction when she heard that Beyoncé was recording [...] "If I Were a Boy".

Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's {{going to be on}} my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when I got this, people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> to another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics.

500|$|Although Sibelius {{informed}} {{his secretary}} in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret {{confined to the}} composer's private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius {{from time to time}} hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: [...] "I have finished my eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will be delighted <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over to you when the time comes." [...] In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony [...] "in his mind"; only in 1954 did he admit, {{in a letter to the}} widow of his friend Adolf Paul, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer's biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.|$|E
