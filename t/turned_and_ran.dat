They landed under heavy fire from the American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> towards the fort.|$|E
25|$|Inside the school, teacher Dave Sanders had {{successfully}} evacuated {{students from the}} cafeteria; where some of them went up a staircase leading {{to the second floor}} of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the Library Hallway in the main South Hallway. By now, Harris and Klebold were inside the main hallway. Sanders and another student were down at the end of the hallway still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.|$|E
500|$|A {{second group}} {{surrounded}} PC Coombes, who sustained a five-inch-long cut to his face, and broken {{upper and lower}} jaws. In 2004 {{he said he was}} still suffering the effects of the attack, which the police regard as attempted murder, including poor hearing and eyesight, epileptic fits, and a memory so poor that he was left unable to read a book or drive. A third constable, Michael Shepherd, had his protective helmet pierced by an iron spike. Several of the officers and firemen <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> back toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes. Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: [...] "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. I literally slid into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck. We dragged him out, but he was in a hell of a state": ...|$|E

500|$|Leading the {{southern}} American column, General Sullivan entered Trenton by the abandoned river road and blocked the only crossing over the Assunpink Creek {{to cut off}} the Hessian escape. Sullivan briefly held up his advance to make sure Greene's division had time to drive the Hessians from their outposts in the north. [...] Soon after, they continued their advance, attacking the Hermitage, home of Philemon Dickinson, where 50 Jägers under the command of Lieutenant von Grothausen were stationed. Lieutenant von Grothausen brought 12 of his Jägers into action against the advanced guard, but had only advanced a few hundred yards when he saw a column of Americans advancing to the Hermitage. [...] Pulling back to the Hessian barracks, he was joined {{by the rest of the}} Jägers. [...] After the exchange of one volley, they <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran,</b> some trying to swim across the creek, while others escaped over the bridge, which had not yet been cut off. [...] The 20 British Dragoons also fled. As Greene and Sullivan's columns pushed into the town, Washington moved to high ground north of King and Queens streets to see the action and direct his troops. [...] By this time, American artillery from the other side of the Delaware River came into action, devastating the Hessian positions.|$|E

[...] Tarleton's force, {{faced with a}} terrible surprise, began to collapse; some men {{surrendering}} on the spot, while others <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran.</b> [...] Howard's men charged forward and seized the two British grasshopper cannons. [...] William Washington's cavalry came around from behind the opposite American left to hit the British on their right flank and rear. [...] Pickens' militia, having now re-formed, charged {{out from behind the}} hill—completing a 360-degree circle around the American position—to hit the 71st Highlander Scots on the British left flank and rear. [...] Howard ordered the Virginia militia, whose withdrawal had brought on the British ill-fated charge, to turn about and attack the Scots from the other direction.|$|E
2500|$|The Aboriginal men {{gathered}} up their spears and woomeras, {{as the women}} and children fled towards the river, where Captain Stirling, Captain Meares, Thomas Peel and 12 others were waiting in hiding. [...] Ellis was soon in a melee with the Noongars, and Norcott, recognising a troublemaker called Noonaar, shot him with his double-barrelled shotgun, causing the first casualty. [...] Five or more Aboriginal people were killed in the first charge, and the remainder of the Aboriginal group then <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> towards the river, intending to cross and scatter into the hills. [...] One of the eldest women in the tribe, Teelak, was shot dead with her 4-year-old daughter screaming violently. At least 13 other children and women were then shot. Daisy M. Bates, writing for The Western Mail, 5 August 1926, said women and children were carefully spared, held during the fighting, then released afterward, on realising this some men [...] "cried out that they were of the other sex" [...] There are conflicting reports in regards to whether or not women and children were also shot and killed, with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people claiming that this did happen.|$|E
2500|$|Pique {{encountered}} [...] off {{the island}} of Desirade at Pointe à Pitre, Guadeloupe on 4 January 1795. Pique at first tried to avoid an action, but eventually the two ships came to close quarters {{in the early hours}} of 5 January. The two ships closed and exchanged broadsides, with both sustaining heavy damage; Blanche lost her main and mizzen masts. Pique then <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> afoul of the Blanche, with her bowsprit caught across her port quarter. While the French made several attempts to board, which were repulsed, the crew of Blanche attempted to lash the bowsprit to their capstan, but during the attempt Captain Faulknor was killed by a musket ball to the heart. Pique then broke away from Blanche and came round her stern, this time colliding on the starboard quarter. Blanches men quickly lashed the bowsprit to the stump of their mainmast, which held her fast. Pique was now unable to manoeuvre or bring any of her guns to bear on Blanche. After being repeatedly raked by Blanches guns, Pique surrendered. Casualties for the British were eight killed, including Captain Faulknor, and 21 wounded. Pique had lost 76 killed and 110 wounded. The two ships were joined later that morning by the 64-gun , which helped exchange and secure the prisoners and tow the ships to port. Blanche towed her prize to a British port, where she was named and registered on 5 September.|$|E

2500|$|Faulknor then {{proceeded}} to patrol off Pointe à Pitre, Guadeloupe, where the 36-gun French frigate Pique {{was known to be}} refitting. The French ship came out of the harbour on 4 January, and the two frigates spent several hours manoeuvring and circling each other, trying to gain an advantage. The battle started early on the morning of 5 January, with the two ships closing and exchanging broadsides, before Pique <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> afoul of Blanche, with her bowsprit caught across her port quarter. While the French made several attempts to board, which were repulsed, the crew of Blanche attempted to lash the bowsprit to their capstan, but during the attempt Captain Faulknor was killed by a musket ball to the heart. Pique then broke away from Blanche and came round her stern, this time colliding on the starboard quarter. Blanches men quickly lashed the bowsprit to the stump of their mainmast, which held her fast. Heavy volleys of musket fire were now exchanged between the two ships, while the men of Blanche attempted to manoeuvre their guns into a position to fire on the trapped Frenchman. They eventually had to blow away part of Blanches woodwork to achieve this. They now raked the Pique until she was forced to surrender, over five hours since the battle had begun. Casualties for the British were eight killed, including Captain Faulknor, and 21 wounded. Pique had lost 76 killed and 110 wounded. The two ships were joined later that morning by the 64-gun , which helped exchange and secure the prisoners and tow the ships to port. Pique was taken into the Royal Navy, as HMS Pique. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the award of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Blanche 4 Jany. 1795" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
