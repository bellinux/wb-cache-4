40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of a default mode network (DMN) of brain function {{is based on}} observations of task-independent decreases of brain activity during effort as participants are engaged in tasks in contrast <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> On the other hand, studies also showed that DMN regions activate rather than deactivate in response to task-related events. Thus, does DMN “deactivate” during effort as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting?</b> We hypothesized that, with high-frequency event-related signals removed, the task-residual activities of the DMN would decrease as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> We addressed this hypothesis with two approaches. First, we examined DMN activities during resting, task residuals, and task conditions in the stop signal task using independent component analysis (ICA). Second, we compared the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) signals of DMN in resting, task residuals, and task data. In the results of ICA of 76 subjects, the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) showed increased activation during task as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> and task residuals, indicating DMN responses to task events. Precuneus but not the PCC showed decreased activity during task residual as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> The latter finding was mirrored by fALFF, which is decreased in the precuneus during task residuals, as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> and task. These results suggested that the low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent signals of the precuneus may represent a useful index of effort during cognitive performance...|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients post total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) {{remain at}} high risk of developing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) during the recovery period following surgery despite the availability of effective pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic methods. The use of calf muscle neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) during the hospitalised recovery period on this patient group may be effective at preventing DVT. However, the haemodynamic effectiveness and comfort characteristics of NMES in post-THA patients immediately following surgery have yet to be established. Methods: The popliteal veins of 11 patients, who had undergone unilateral total hip replacement surgery on the day previous to the study, were measured using Doppler ultrasound during a 4 hour neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) session of the calf muscles. The effect of calf muscle NMES on peak venous velocity, mean venous velocity and volume flow were compared <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> values. Comfort was assessed using a 100 mm non-hatched visual analogue scale taken before application of NMES, once NMES was initiated and before NMES was withdrawn. Results: In the operated limb NMES produced increases in peak venous velocity of 99 % compared <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> Mean velocity increased by 178 % compared <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> and volume flow increased by 159 % compared <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> In the un-operated limb, peak venous velocity increased by 288 %, mean velocity increased by 354 % and volume flow increased by 614 % compared to basal flow (pThis work is supported in part by the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET) ...|$|R
