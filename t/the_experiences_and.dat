5|$|The {{son of a}} publisher, Waugh {{was educated}} at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and briefly worked as a {{schoolmaster}} {{before he became a}} full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends, and developed a taste for country house society. In the 1930s, he travelled extensively, often as a special newspaper correspondent in which capacity he reported from Abyssinia {{at the time of the}} 1935 Italian invasion. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War (1939–1945), first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> the wide range of people he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown, which occurred in the early 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Set in a {{realistic}} environment (as {{opposed to the}} more fantastical settings prominently featured in children's programming), certain stories (often in {{second half of the}} episode) may not necessarily focus on the titular protagonist's point of view and may instead detail <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> viewpoints of surrounding characters, usually Arthur's schoolmates. Often such episodes will depict those characters handling situations often faced by children in actuality as a means of guiding audiences through those situations, including bed-wetting, asthma or dyslexia, and Arthur's character sometimes may see a reduced role (in some episodes, Arthur himself does not appear in the story at all). Stories in later seasons dealt with more serious issues or subjects, such as cancer or Asperger syndrome, albeit numerous episodes may simply address topics including childhood fears, trends or fantasies. Occasionally a couple of episodes might offer very little educational value at all. In spite of the realistically designed environment, the series may showcase the fantasies or daydreams of a few characters on a number of occasions, and a few episodes features supernatural elements such as ghosts or secret situations unknown to other characters such as Kate and Pal's friendship.|$|E

[...] The Cardassian occupation of Bajor (the Bajoran homeworld) has been compared to the Holocaust, with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor. In his chapter [...] "Speakers for the Dead: Star Trek, the Holocaust, and the Representation of Atrocity" [...] within the book Star Trek as Myth, writer Matthew Wilheim Kapell compared <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor.

He explains that Kira is a far more [...] "Americanize" [...] character, acting as a [...] "resister and even liberator" [...] during the occupation. As a result, unlike Ro, Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma. Further commentary of Ro's relationship to religion have been made. In The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek, James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in [...] "The Next Phase" [...] to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri's Inferno.|$|E
