5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E
500|$|Johnston rued bitterly {{that the}} Rhodesians had {{apparently}} made practical arrangements {{for an independent}} office in Lisbon anyway, even going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> renting the prospective mission premises. He repeated the claim he had made in the meeting with Smith on 18 August, saying once more that the Federal government had not made appointments off its own bat. He accepted {{that there was an}} independent Rhodesian envoy in Pretoria, but argued that this was the result of South Africa's enforced withdrawal from the Commonwealth. He did not mention the Rhodesian (formerly Federal) office in Lourenço Marques, which Wood comments could be considered [...] "precedent for Portugal".|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Haninah {{read the}} words [...] "the {{judgment}} is God's" [...] in [...] to teach that God views the action of wicked judges unjustly taking money away from one and giving it to another as an imposition upon God, putting God <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> returning the value to the rightful owner. (Rashi interpreted that {{it was as though}} the judge had taken the money from God.).|$|E
2500|$|With no theatre, {{there is}} no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after {{it has already been}} analysed.

2500|$|Le Sage {{was worried}} about the {{possibility}} that people might think he had gotten the idea for the gravitation theory from Fatio, because he went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> making a [...] "certificate", and having it signed by the mathematician Pfleiderer and the astronomer Mallet (two friends of Le Sage), stating that, except for a copy made by Abauzit in 1758, Le Sage saw no papers of Fatio before 1766, and in these papers there was nothing which was not developed by Le Sage in a more detailed way.|$|E
50|$|The {{story has}} obvious affinities with the fable of the Lion's Share and the similar {{political}} moral drawn from it by some commentators.

2500|$|Between 1935 and 1939 Celentano {{exhibited}} {{regularly at}} the Walker Gallery. In 1939 his first, and apparently his only one-man show took place there. Of this show a {{critic for the}} New York Sun said [...] "He paints the humble domestic life that he knows with a frankness as to its happenings, a sympathy and a tireless eye for detail that command respect, if not enthusiasm. The curious may learn all about that life from his paintings without going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> doing settlement work or running the slightest risk {{of getting out of}} their class." [...] His shows at the Walker Gallery produced institutional sales to the Carnegie Institute, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Whitney Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Esperanto {{has been}} used in a number of films and novels. Typically, this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign {{language}} without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> inventing a new language. The Charlie Chaplin film The Great Dictator (1940) showed Jewish ghetto shop signs in Esperanto. Two full-length feature films have been produced with dialogue entirely in Esperanto: , in 1964, and Incubus, a 1965 B-movie horror film. A language school teaching [...] "Entrenationo" [...] (representing a satire on Esperanto) is featured in Graham Greene's novel The Confidential Agent, which was made into a film starring Charles Boyer and Lauren Bacall (1945). Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatization of the novel [...] (Gerda Has Disappeared). In Stamboul Train, Greene used Esperanto as the language on signs at the main train station in Budapest. A number of mainstream films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way.|$|E
