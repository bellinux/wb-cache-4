40|$|Previous work on car-trailer {{stability}} {{has been}} largely limited to theoretical studies with some reference to practical experience or accident statistics. In this study, extensive and systematic experimental investigations were carried out oil a combined car-adjustable-trailer system. The influence of different trailer parameters on the system high-speed stability was examined by changing the mass, dimensions, and inertial characteristics of a fully adjustable trailer. It {{was found that the}} dominant factors affecting stability were the trailer yaw inertia, nose mass (mass distribution), and trailer axle position. The tyre pressure also affects the stability, although this effect is less significant. It is interesting to see that the <b>trailer</b> <b>mass</b> alone does not dramatically affect the high-speed stability, as this runs contrary to current guidelines relating to limits on the relative mass of the car and trailer. Experimental tests on a friction stabilizer and on car electronic stability programs demonstrate that both of these improve the high-speed stability and help to delay the onset of 'snaking'...|$|E
40|$|The frame {{structure}} of the trailer may influence both the traction and the tractor-trailer stability, especially along sloped paths. The aim {{of this research was}} to analyze a trailer overturning and the strains on the connected tractors (wheeled, or crawled) during log transportation (loose or tied) along a hillside. Two two-axle trailers were used: tandem and turntable steering. Three types of measurements were carried out during the field tests: (i) the detachment from the ground of the rear upstream wheels (or crawler); (ii) the transversal and longitudinal strains occurring when the trailer overturned (and released the hooking system of the tractor); (iii) the lateral deviation of the rear wheels (or crawler) of the tractor. The study highlighted that the two-axle trailer with turntable steering combined with the crawl tractor gave better results in terms of safety during trailer overturning. In addition, independent of the type of trailer, a tied load was found to be more dangerous than a load restrained only by steel struts, because when overturning, the load forms a single unit with the <b>trailer</b> <b>mass</b> which increases the strains...|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} an impending rollover {{threat of a}} heavy vehicle forms the essential basis for developing a rollover prevention system. The vehicle roll stability and the rollover predictors are most {{significantly related to the}} center of gravity height of the <b>trailer</b> sprung <b>mass,</b> which tends to vary considerably. The developments in the rollover warning devices have been mostly limited due to extreme complexities associated with the onsite measurement of the center of gravity height of an arbitrarily loaded vehicle. In this study, the system identification techniques are applied to obtain an estimate of the c. g. (Center of Gravity) height {{on the basis of the}} measured response under a controlled directional maneuver. A simulation model of a five-axle tractor-semitrailer is analyzed in the TruckSim environment to identify the desirable response measure, which is most sensitive to variation in the c. g. height, and the test maneuver for deriving the desired response. A 10 D. O. F. (degree-of-freedom) analytical model of the vehicle is developed and linearized to derive the analytical transfer function relating the steer angle to the desired semitrailer sprung mass roll angle response. A model reduction technique is further applied to obtain a reduced-order analytical transfer function to facilitate its implementation...|$|R
40|$|Statistics {{show that}} the travel of {{agricultural}} machinery to a work area and their movement during labour {{is the source of}} many serious accidents. The most dangerous in consequences prove to be those that occur during transport and associated with maneuvering tractors and machinery (about 30 % of all fatal accidents). It can be assumed {{that at least some of}} these accidents were caused indirectly by the specific design features of agricultural machines which adversely affect the driveability. The single- and multi-loop structures of the driver-vehicle system models are formulated to study the contributions of various preview and prediction strategies to the path tracking and dynamic performance of the articulated vehicle. In the presented study the compensatory model of driver utilizes the lateral acceleration of the tractor, roll angle of <b>trailer</b> sprung <b>mass</b> and the articulation rate as the internal motion feedback variables. The control model of steering of an agricultural set has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The model has been constructed with the use of stochastic methods and operational transmittances describing the various components of the system. The model operational transmittances has been estimated using Box-Jenkins and continuous-time process models from input-output data. The model has been tested using experimental data from road investigation of the agricultural set...|$|R

The fire {{department}} provides fire suppression, rescue, and basic life support services to all of Richland Township and mutual aid services to surrounding areas. The fire department is staffed by approximately 35 volunteer members who are trained in fire suppression, emergency medical services, and rescue. The fire department has seven pieces of apparatus: one fire engine (Engine 48), two 3,000-gallon tankers (Engine/Tanker 40 & Tanker 44), one Medium Rescue (Rescue 49), one Grass truck (Grass 47) and two transporting BLS ambulances (Ambulances 45 and 46). Richland is also {{the home of the}} Madison County Hazardous Materials Decontamination Team (Decon 40), which has a fully equipped decon <b>trailer,</b> including a <b>mass</b> decontamination tent. The fire department responds to approximately 400-450 calls for service per year.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. The South African sugar {{industry}} is of significant {{local and international}} importance and covers an area in excess of 450 000 hectares. This area yields approximately 21 million tons of sugarcane per annum which is transported almost exclusively by road, from farms to the sugar mills. The industry is under increasing economic pressures to improve its productivity and competitiveness and sugarcane transport in the sugarcane supply chain {{has been identified as}} one area where large improvements and associated cost reductions can be made. This is mainly due to the excess in number of vehicles in the inbound transport system, the high relative cost of transport compared to other production costs in producing sugarcane, and the high fixed costs associated with truck fleet operations. A simulation case study of the transport system was completed in 2005 in the Sezela Mill area in which approximately 2. 2 million tons of sugarcane is transported per annum over an average distance of 29 km by approximately 120 independently managed vehicles owned by a wide range of hauliers and individual growers. This amounts to an estimated cost of R 58 million per annum. This study investigated the potential savings that could occur {{as a result of a}} central fleet control system with integrated vehicle scheduling. A scheduling software package named ASICAM, which resulted in significant savings in the timber industry (Weintraub et al, 1996), was applied within the Sezela region. Results suggested that the number of trucks in the fleet could theoretically be reduced by at least 50 %, providing that a central office controls vehicle movements and that all hauliers serve all growers in an equitable fashion. In addition, investigations towards decreasing loading times, decreasing offloading times, changing vehicle speeds and increasing payloads by reducing <b>trailer</b> tare <b>mass</b> showed further reductions in the number of trucks required...|$|R
