2500|$|Doctor Who {{returned}} to British screens in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston {{playing the role}} of the Ninth Doctor in the first series. Tennant replaced him as of the second series, making his first, brief appearance as the Tenth Doctor in the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] (2005) {{at the end of the}} regeneration scene, and also appeared in a special [...] shown as part of the 2005 Children in Need appeal, broadcast on 18 November 2005. He began filming the new series of Doctor Who in late July 2005. His first full-length outing as the Doctor was a 60-minute special, [...] "The Christmas Invasion", first broadcast on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant had been formally offered the role of the Doctor during rehearsals for The Quatermass Experiment. Although the casting was not officially announced until later in April, both castmates and crew became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng (Quatermass) changed his first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from [...] "Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Gordon" [...] to [...] "Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Doctor" [...] as a deliberate reference.|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{became a}} Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in October 1979, {{receiving}} as a Law lord additionally a life peerage as Baron Lane, of St Ippollitts in the County of Hertfordshire. He {{had been appointed}} by the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, soon after Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election. His appointment was welcomed in the legal profession, where Lane {{was regarded as a}} genial figure ("Geoffrey Dawson, Baron Lane. [...] Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again."), but eventually not welcomed by Lane himself, who disliked the work. [...] The overdue retirement of Lord Widgery, whose physical ill-health and increasing dementia had become a suppressed scandal, led to Hailsham picking Lane to follow him as Lord Chief Justice from 1980.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, but I don't wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> walk <b>back</b> again," [...] said Rollo. [...] "We {{will come}} back by the diligence. There are several diligences and omnibuses that come by Aigle, on the way here, {{in the course of}} the day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, my dear; no {{objection}} at all: of course not. I shall be delighted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> and so, I'm sure, will Rachel; but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is a great}} {{satisfaction}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> in {{your old}} home, under our wing. I have a great deal {{to tell you about the}} arrangements." ...|$|E

6000|$|The girl {{glancing at}} him in sidelong fashion noticed his curious little smile. [...] "Oh, yes, I think I shall," [...] she said. [...] "I shall expect <b>to</b> hear <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come <b>back</b> with the silver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Julian," [...] Mrs. Troutbeck exclaimed as {{she threw}} her arms round his neck, [...] "what a relief it is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. It has been terrible for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, I am glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. Of course I {{have been}} a little lonely, but I bear that kind of thing better than most people. Thank God, my eyes are good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Keep' em amused and interested,' said Revere. 'They {{went on the}} drink, poor fools, {{after the}} first two cases, {{and there was no}} improvement. Oh, it's good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Bobby! Porkiss is a never mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, {{and there}} was a little tremor in his voice, [...] "I don't think I shall forget you. Well, if ever you grow tired of the cities you will {{remember}} the lonely folks who are longing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> home again <b>back</b> there on the prairie." ...|$|R
6000|$|The old {{king was}} furious {{when he found}} that all his arts had failed; that his son still lived {{and that he would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up the crown to him now he was married, for that was the law of the land. He longed to know how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed rejoice <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> safely <b>back,</b> but I cannot imagine why the {{beautiful}} carriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you; why <b>you</b> <b>had</b> them destroyed.' ...|$|R
50|$|The game's {{narrative}} {{takes place}} using cutscenes {{at the beginning}} and end of each level, featuring Shatner himself (in character as Walter Bascom) as the narrator. Cutscenes vary depending on the player's performance during missions: if the player does not shoot any innocent non-player characters (NPCs), manages to take out the TekLord in the mission, and does not raise any tension (i.e. walking with his gun drawn), Shatner delivers praise. On the other hand, shooting characters or aborting the mission causes him <b>to</b> threaten <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> put <b>back</b> into cryo-storage.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{the great}} curse of it; that's what I deplore," [...] Sewell broke out, [...] "in {{our young people}} coming from {{the country to the}} city. They must all have some genteel occupation! I don't blame them; but I would gladly <b>have</b> saved <b>you</b> this experience--this knowledge--if I could. I felt that I <b>had</b> done <b>you</b> a kind of wrong in being the means, however {{indirectly}} and innocently, of your coming to Boston, and I would willingly <b>have</b> done anything <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the country. But you seemed to distrust me--to find something hostile in me--and I {{did not know how to}} influence you." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Gawain {{answered}} kindly {{though in}} scorn, [...] 'Why, let my lady bind {{me if she}} will, [...] And let my lady beat me if she will: [...] But an she send her delegate to thrall [...] These fighting hands of mine--Christ kill me then [...] But I will slice him handless by the wrist, [...] And let my lady sear the stump for him, [...] Howl as he may.

Wherefore now thy horse [...] And armour: let me go: be comforted: [...] Give me three days to melt her fancy, and hope [...] The third night hence will bring thee news of gold.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Politkovskaya had a {{conversation}} with Ramzan Kadyrov, then Prime Minister of Chechnya. One of his assistants said to her, [...] "Someone ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> shot <b>you</b> <b>back</b> in Moscow, right on the street, like they do in your Moscow". Ramzan repeated after him: [...] "You're an enemy. To be shot...." [...] On the day of her murder, said Novaya Gazetas chief editor Dmitry Muratov, Politkovskaya <b>had</b> planned <b>to</b> file a lengthy story on the torture practices believed to be used by the Chechen security detachments known as Kadyrovites. In her final interview, she described Kadyrov—now president of Chechnya—as the [...] "Chechen Stalin of our days".|$|R
6000|$|... "How happy old Bunce will be," [...] said Mrs. Bold, {{clapping}} {{her soft}} hands softly. [...] "How happy they {{all will be}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. You may be sure there will soon be friendship among them again when you are there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Finn, how are you?" [...] said Lord Chiltern, {{stretching}} out his left hand. [...] "Glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again, and congratulate {{you about the}} seat. It was put down in red herrings, and we found nearly {{a dozen of them}} afterwards,--enough to kill half the pack." ...|$|E
6000|$|Winifred {{thought that}} [...] "rather nice," [...] and added comfortably: [...] "Well, Holly's sensible; she'll {{know how to}} deal with it. I shan't tell your uncle. It'll only bother him. It's a great comfort <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> my dear boy, now that I'm getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{consider}} for a while, and perpend, mes enfants. It {{is about}} your characters that I've called to-night. In {{the language of}} the schools, what the dooce <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been up <b>to</b> in Mr. Prout's house? It isn't anything to laugh over. He says that you so lowered the tone of the house he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pack <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to your studies. Is that true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When we got here, {{and found}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> look for us, I {{wanted to get}} another tug and go right after you, but my wife {{was a good deal}} shaken up, and I did not want to leave her; and Parker and Darrell said they had given {{positive}} orders <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> brought <b>back</b> this morning, so I waited. I was only too glad to know you were all safe. I got up early in the morning, and went down to watch for <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> must <b>have</b> been surprised <b>to</b> see me fishing, but I <b>had</b> nothing else <b>to</b> do, and so I hired a pole and line of a boy. It helped very much to pass the time away." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ross thanked Lee formally, {{but there}} was more than {{gratitude}} in his glance, and she turned away to hide her face from other eyes. Strange place it was for the blooming of love's roses, but they were in her cheeks as she faced her mother; and Lize, with fresh acknowledgment of her beauty, broke out again: [...] "Well, this settles it. I'm {{going to get out of}} this town, dearie. I'm done. This ends the cattle country for me. I don't know how I've put up with these yapps all these years. I've been robbed and insulted and spit upon just long enough. I won't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> dragged into this mess. I ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> turned <b>you</b> <b>back</b> the day <b>you</b> landed here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very happy}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Robert," [...] replied Mr. Worthington, {{and it was}} true. It would have been strange indeed if some tremor of {{sentiment}} {{had not been in}} his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye as he looked upon his son.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{spent a good}} {{few years}} {{trying to put a}} bit together, {{and this is the first}} chance I've had," [...] he said; [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> me as a British subject on that concession. We'll go down into the village now if you're ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] he said, [...] "that intrigue is the {{resource}} {{of those who}} have lived their lives so quickly that they have found weariness. For these things to-day interest me very little. I am only anxious <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again, Lucille, to find ourselves on our way to our old home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is satisfactory, of course; but {{it would}} not <b>have,</b> <b>to</b> my mind, {{anything}} like the importance of your series of adventures, which will be something to think over all your life. I wish I had been there, with my crew, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> <b>you</b> up; though I am afraid that most of them would have shared the fate of your Malay escort, in that sudden attack in the forest." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, the band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as coming from [...] "the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems, ... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre." [...] Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> <b>To</b> Put <b>You</b> <b>Back</b> On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' replied Fagin, 'not very. He {{was charged}} with {{attempting}} to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,--his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him <b>back.</b> <b>You</b> should <b>have</b> known the Dodger, my dear; <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> known the Dodger.' ...|$|R
