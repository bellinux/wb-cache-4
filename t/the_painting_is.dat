50|$|In 1875, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by <b>the</b> Bremen Art Society, although Gude incorrectly identifies {{them as the}} Stadtgalerie Bremen in his notes about the sale. In 1907 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Kunsthalle Bremen. In 1920 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> auctioned off {{due in part to}} changing tastes in art and the painting's large size (4.78 m2) which made it difficult to store. In 1932 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> auctioned off again in Oslo where it was {{purchased by}} its current owner.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{realistic}} plot, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> used in <b>the</b> Soviet {{school curriculum}} as a topic for writing an essay. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{well known to}} the Soviet public.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{acquired}} by <b>The</b> Broad on November 7, 1996. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> featured in <b>the</b> exhibition Creature held at The Broad from November 5 to March 19 2016.|$|R
5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius, {{is barely}} {{visible in the}} top right of the painting. His {{presence}} in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E
5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> said to have been created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl {{on the verge of tears}} standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> identical to that in the final version.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{acquired}} in 1907 by Josef Stránský, an art dealer {{and a friend}} of Picasso's. From 1945 to 1962, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> owned by Picasso's son Paulo Picasso.|$|R
500|$|When <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> thus copied in the 17th century {{from the}} 16th-century original, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{furnished}} with a Baroque frame carrying a heart-shaped cartouche. This cartouche displayed the message: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{intent and}} meaning of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>are</b> unclear, and disputed by scholars. The highly diverse interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>are</b> {{partly due to the}} loss of {{information}} from the damage.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the {{orthogonals}} in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Paddington {{station was}} the subject of William Powell Frith's 1862 {{painting}} The Railway Station. The portrait was viewed by over 21,000 people (paying a shilling each) in the first seven weeks of it being publicly shown. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> now held in the Royal Holloway College.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{exhibited}} at <b>the</b> Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1888. Aird died in 1911, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> inherited {{by his son}} Sir John Richard Aird, 2nd Baronet. After Alma-Tadema died in 1912, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{exhibited at}} a memorial exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1913, the last time it was seen at a public exhibition in the UK until 2014.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{publicly}} {{sold for}} charity when Rockox died in 1640, but it <b>is</b> unknown who <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> sold to. In 1700, a panel named Samson and Delilah {{was bought by}} Prince Johann Adams Andreas I. This <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> likely Rubens' <b>painting.</b> However, when <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> part of <b>the</b> Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna, Austria in the eighteenth century, the painter was identified as Jan van den Hoecke, who was a principal assistant of Rubens in <b>the</b> 1630's. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> then sold in 1880 in Paris, where it was later found by Ludwig Burchard in 1929. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> sold at auction in 1980 at Christie's, purchased by the National Gallery, London for $5 million.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by <b>the</b> Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1893, where it still remains. In 1959 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> damaged severely by water, but was restored in the 2000s.|$|R
5|$|The Kiss was {{exhibited}} in 1903 at Munch's show Love's Awakening, {{paired with a}} copy of his Madonna. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> now part of the collection of the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway; the museum is dedicated to Munch and his works.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> an austere but {{affecting}} {{portrayal of}} sorrow and grief. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving {{over the body}} of Christ. They are, from left to right, Nicodemus, Mary Salome, Mary of Clopas, Mary, the mother of Jesus, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{described as}} {{the signing of the}} Declaration of Independence. In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.|$|E
5000|$|His <b>painting,</b> Heavenly Mist, <b>is</b> a {{rendering}} of the sinking of John F. Kennedy's PT Boat 109 by the Japanese Destroyer, Amagiri. [...] <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> commissioned by George E. Lowe {{in the summer of}} 1960. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> featured in Robert J. Donovan's book, PT-109, John F.

50|$|As a result, he {{was arrested}} and {{tortured}} by the security police. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> smuggled to <b>the</b> United Kingdom after it was banned in South Africa, and <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> returned in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Between 1878 and 1943, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> Neue Galerie at the Schloss Bellevue. In 1943 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{moved to}} a store {{elsewhere}} - Kassel was a target for Allied bombing and the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe was severely damaged. In 1956 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> moved to emergency headquarters of the Landesmuseum until in April 1974 it returned to Kassel, initially in the Corps de Logis at the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> {{today in}} the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which was {{conceived}} by Pittsburgh financier Andrew Mellon in the late 1930s. It was one of 126 paintings from his personal collection donated to the gallery and was {{on display at the}} museum opening in March 1941– three years after his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The {{perimeter of the}} large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> sold to Annie S. Coburn from Chicago for $100,000. After {{her death}} in 1932 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> bequeathed to <b>the</b> Art Institute of Chicago, where it has {{remained}} since 1933.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by <b>the</b> International Art Center (IAC) at a 1996 Christie's auction in London for £2 million.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{commissioned by}} Nicolaas II Rockox, Lord mayor of Antwerp, Belgium, for his Rockox House. In {{addition to being}} a patron, Rockox was a close personal friend of Rubens. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> specifically intended to be placed above a 7-foot mantleshelf, where <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> would have <b>been</b> seen from below.|$|R
5|$|To {{the left}} of the open space north of the medieval city are the steep {{southern}} slopes of the Brunkebergsåsen esker, a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city. Missing in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> the small island of Strömsborg, which was little more than an insignificant cliff at the time.|$|E
5|$|Big Painting No. 6 (sometimes Big Painting or Big Painting VI) is a 1965 oil and Magna {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Measuring 235cm × 330cm (92.5 in × 129 in), {{it is part}} of the Brushstrokes series of artworks that includes several paintings and sculptures whose subject is the actions made with a house-painter's brush. It set a record auction price for a painting by a living American artist when it sold for $60,000 in 1970. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> in the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen collection.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> first {{exhibited}} in Edinburgh, at the Royal Scottish Academy. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{on loan from}} owners Diageo to the Scottish National War Museum in Edinburgh Castle from 2000 until 2016, when it was donated to the national collection.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{completion}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> rejected from <b>the</b> Society of Artists {{exhibition of}} 1930. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> only purchased for the National Gallery of Victoria in 1967, {{which has been}} criticised as indicative of the neglect of Cossington Smith's work.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{displayed in}} an exhibit that featured modern and contemporary art. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> exhibited at <b>the</b> Miami Art Fair in January 2007, {{and created a}} worldwide controversy that was covered by ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and Fox television networks, as well as The International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, and many other international news sources.
