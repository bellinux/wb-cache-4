500|$|At the end, as {{the family}} stare at the head, the Simpsons debate on what the moral of this whole story is. It cannot be 'A good deed is its own reward' as Bart got a reward he likes, {{but at the same}} time it is not 'No good deed goes unrewarded' as <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have {{received}} anything if Homer had not written the angry letter. Lisa suggests that perhaps there is not a lesson to be learned from this, to which Homer agrees as it's [...] "just a bunch of stuff that happened", though everyone agrees it has been a memorable few days.|$|E
500|$|According to Roger Waters, Barrett {{came into}} {{what was to be}} their last {{practice}} session with a new song he had dubbed [...] "Have You Got It Yet?" [...] The song seemed simple enough when he first presented it, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn and they eventually realised that while they were practising it, Barrett kept changing the arrangement. He would then play it again, with the arbitrary changes, and sing [...] "Have you got it yet?" [...] Eventually they realised <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would,</b> and that they were simply bearing the brunt of Barrett's idiosyncratic sense of humour. Waters had called it [...] "a real act of mad genius".|$|E
500|$|The band went {{on their}} first tour of the United States after the album's release—Slagel gave the band a list of {{addresses}} and contact numbers of the venues. Araya was still working at the hospital, and called the members saying, [...] "Today's the day. Are we gonna do this?" [...] The band knew {{if they did not}} tour now, <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would.</b> So they set out taking Araya's Camaro and U-Haul. During the first leg of the tour, Slayer had no manager; Doug Goodman, who had met the band when he was first in line for their first show in Northern California (opening for Lȧȧz Rockit) took a vacation from his job at a grocery store to help out on the tour, eventually becoming the band's [...] "tour guide". Goodman now tour manages acts such as Green Day and Beck.|$|E

2500|$|Traffic {{levels on}} the G never began {{to reach the}} optimistic {{expectations}} of the line's backers, and by the early 1910s {{it was clear that}} <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would.</b> [...] The railroad's lack of economic viability was realized as early as 1913, when the G's substantial construction indebtedness (nearly $6,000,000) was written off by the Northern Pacific in exchange for full ownership of the line. [...] Despite continual efforts to economize, the railroad lost money throughout much of its existence.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} reports about what occurred at Fort Pillow. Only 90 out of approximately 262 US Colored Troops survived the battle. Casualties were also high among white {{defenders of the}} fort, with 205 out of about 500 surviving. Forrest's Confederate forces were accused of subjecting captured soldiers to brutality, with allegations that some were burned to death. Forrest's men were alleged to have set fire to Union barracks with wounded Union soldiers inside; however, the report of Union Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn said that act was due to orders carried out by Union Lieutenant John D. Hill. Van Horn also reported that, [...] "There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> surrender or ask for quarter".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{prospects}} who {{may have}} never had a serious look were given chances they thought <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have. Undrafted journeyman Chris Minard had been signed with Alaska for his third season in the ECHL when the lockout allowed Davis Payne to assign him on the same line as Gomez at the Aces. Gomez saw a gem that led to the 2005 ECHL All-Star Game, and a top ECHL player that season; the pairing led to Gomez giving Minard a shot after the lockout ended, and he played his way into the AHL, and eventually signing a two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, receiving in 2007–08 his first call-up to the NHL. Minard said about the experience, [...] "That's when I learned a lot about being a goal-scorer, playing with a guy like that who can pass the puck. It was a pretty cool experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first record}} {{to contain the}} word [...] "rockabilly" [...] in a song title was issued in November 1956 [...] "Rock a Billy Gal", {{although}} Johnny and Dorsey Burnette recorded [...] "Rock Billy Boogie" [...] for the Coral label on July 4, 1956. The song had been written and performed much earlier, and refer {{to the birth of}} Johnny's son Rocky and Dorsey's son Billy, who were born around the same time in 1953, and were firstborns for each of the brothers. The song was part of their repertoire in 1956 when they were living in New York City and performing with Gene Vincent. It's easy to understand how the New York audience might have thought the Burnettes were singing [...] "Rockabilly Boogie," [...] but <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would,</b> because the term hillbilly was derogatory and would never have been used by the artists themselves. Rocky Burnette, who later would become a rockabilly artist himself, has stated on his website that the term rockabilly derives from that song. It's also interesting, that this song has been covered by hundreds of artists in the years since, and is always called [...] "Rockabilly Boogie".|$|E
2500|$|Hittite-Egyptian {{relations}} officially began {{once the}} Hatti took over Mitanni's {{role as the}} ruling power in central Syria and from there tensions {{would continue to be}} high until the conclusion of the treaty nearly one hundred years later. During the invasion and eventual defeat of Mitanni, the Hittite armies poured into Syria and began to exert their rule over the Egyptian vassals of Kadesh and Amurru. The loss of these lands in northern Syria would never be forgotten by the Egyptian pharaohs and their later actions demonstrated that <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> fully concede this loss {{at the hands of the}} Hittite Empire. Egypt's attempts to regain the territory lost during the rule of Akhenaten continued to be futile until under the leadership of Seti I, the father of Ramesses II, significant gains did start to be made. In his own Kadesh-Amurru campaign against the Hittite armies, Seti I vanquished his foes at a battle near Kadesh, but the gains proved short-lived since Kadesh was eventually given up by Seti in a later treaty. The short gain by the Egyptians was the [...] "opening salvo" [...] of a conflict between the two nations, which would drag on over the next two decades.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{initially}} {{planned a}} representational {{setting for the}} film; Verona, Milan and the forest were all to be realistic. However, {{he changed his mind}} early in preproduction and had production designer Barbara Gosnold go in the opposite direction – a stylised setting. To this end, the forest is composed of metal poles with bits of green tinsel and brown sticks stuck to them (the cast and crew referred to the set as [...] "Christmas at Selfridges"). Whilst the set for Verona remained relatively realistic, that for Milan featured young actors dressed like cherubs as extras. This was to convey the idea that the characters lived in a 'Garden of Courtly Love', which was slightly divorced from the everyday reality represented by Verona. Working in tandem with this idea, upon Proteus' arrival in Milan, after meeting Silvia, he is left alone on screen, and the weather suddenly changes from calm and sunny to cloudy and windy, accompanied by a thunderclap. The implication being that Proteus has brought a darkness within him into the garden of courtly delights previously experienced by Silvia. Although the production is edited in a fairly conventional manner, much of it was shot in extremely long takes, and then edited into sections, rather than actually shooting in sections. Director Don Taylor would shoot most of the scenes in single takes, as he felt this enhanced performances and allowed actors to discover aspects which <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> were everything broken up into pieces.|$|E
