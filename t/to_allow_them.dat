5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to be used in the new year.|$|E

In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up.
