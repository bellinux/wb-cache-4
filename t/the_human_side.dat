5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine {{of the first half of}} the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{directors are}} allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythology with common themes and deities, but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories. Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused more on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0, while Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV, referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand {{on which to build}} multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.|$|E

500|$|Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy {{currently}} {{consists of}} seven titles across multiple platforms, including sequels and spin-offs {{of the original}} entries. The entries in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series share the same mythology, interpreted differently and referred to in varying degrees {{for each of the}} game worlds. Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels have a strong connection to the mythos, making extensive use of its terminology and involving many of its deities. Final Fantasy Type-0 used the terminology and made minor reference to the mythos while focusing on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of events, although these references were added during later story development. While the mythos is still present in Final Fantasy XV, it was [...] "disconnected" [...] from the core framework, with specific terminology being removed and its emphasis reduced to become a background element for the world and story.|$|E

500|$|Wendy Parmet, a {{professor}} at Northeastern University Law School, highlights the greatest strengths of And the Band Played On to be [...] "the pain and courage of individual confronted with AIDS" [...] and how it [...] "eloquently portrays <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the crisis" [...] and believes the blame others criticized to be justified; but Parmet considers his technique of assigning an omniscient point of view a weakness, suggesting that it blurs the lines between fact and fiction. In Contemporary Sociology, Peter Manning and Terry Stein also call Shilts' narrative method into question, and ask why, for a syndrome that affects people beyond race, class, and sexual orientation, that Shilts focuses so narrowly on AIDS as it is related to homosexuality. The writers, however, were mostly impressed with the book, calling it an [...] "informative, often brilliant, overview of the emergent meanings of the AIDS epidemic".|$|E
500|$|The Dothraki {{scenes that}} culminate with the [...] "crowning" [...] of Viserys Targaryen was {{acclaimed}} by critics.

[...] The acting of Emilia Clarke, closing her arc initiated in the first episode from a frightened girl to an empowered woman was also praised. VanDerWerff commented on the difficulty to adapt such an evolution from page to screen, but concluded that [...] "Clarke and Lloyd more than seal the deal here." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler also praised Clarke and noted that Daenerys's choice to watch Viserys die was [...] "powerful" [...] and an important shift in her character.|$|E
500|$|A key to Lord's {{method is}} his {{technique}} of adopting an unconventional {{approach to the}} chronology of the event, [...] " [...] an imaginative approach to time and space in which hours and minutes prove extremely malleable, the ship itself seems almost infinitely complex, and the disaster assumes order and unity from far away." [...] In short it is [...] "a modernist narrative [...] around a modernist event." [...] Reviewers highlighted {{the way in which}} Lord depicted <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the Titanic story, which The New York Times called [...] "the core of Mr. Lord's account, and explains its fascination, a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself." [...] While the [...] "legendary acts of gallantry" [...] stood out, the book invites readers to put themselves in the place of those aboard and implicitly asks how they would react in the same situation.

500|$|There {{are three}} major {{divergent}} paths in the game's ending, {{depending on how}} the player resolves encounters with monsters: the Neutral run, the Pacifist run, and the Genocide run. The default Neutral run occurs if the player has killed some but not all of the monsters, or has not killed any monsters. The Neutral run has over twelve variations depending on which monsters were killed. In general, in the Neutral run ending, the human arrives at Asgore's castle and learns that they also need a monster's soul to cross the barrier, forcing them to fight Asgore. Sans stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's [...] "LOVE" [...] is an acronym for [...] "Level Of ViolencE" [...] and [...] "EXP" [...] for [...] "EXecution Points." [...] Sans judges the human based on the combined resolution of the encounters. The human fights and defeats Asgore. However, Flowey sneaks in, kills Asgore, steals the human souls, and becomes a monstrous abomination. By calling out to the six souls for help, the human defeats Flowey, falls unconscious, and awakens on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the barrier; they receive a phone call from Sans, explaining the state of the Underground after the human's departure.|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} Type-0 was written around the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, which also {{includes}} Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XV. The mythos involves how humans are manipulated and controlled by the world's deities. The crystals of Type-0s world were {{the equivalent of the}} fal'Cie, demigods serving these deities. Originally, the crystals were to have been called [...] "fal'Cie". The characters Arecia, Gala and Diva were also created to fill the roles of fal'Cie. The approach taken to the incorporation of the mythos was that the world of Orience was part of a shared universe that also contained the worlds of XIII and XV rather than a standalone existence. As opposed to XIII, which told a story directly related to the mythos' deities, Type-0 focused on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of the story, depicting the deities' role in world events from a historical standpoint. A key element carried directly from the mythos is the l'Cie, humans chosen by servants of the world's deities to fulfill a pre-determined task called a [...] "Focus". Tabata neglected including elements from the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos until approximately halfway through the process. Chiba and Obake were the ones responsible for including the elements in the storyline, as well as including the cyclic nature of the game's world to help communicate some aspects of the mythos: originally disliked by Tabata, he later said that it suited the game due to the heavy eastern influences.|$|E
500|$|Type-0s {{scenario}} {{was conceived}} by Tabata and written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. While {{the game was}} still titled Agito XIII, Tabata described it as [...] "a major title [...] formed {{from a variety of}} concepts" [...] which included the collision of four fantasies (the game's view of Orience), a battle between magic and weapons, and the two sides of reality. The early story concept drew heavily from popular manga and anime, but little survived after the platform change. Tabata instead chose a new style similar to historical films and documentaries. The new story's concept started {{with the idea of a}} war story told by young people caught up in the event, with its story themes revolving around death and its impact on others. A major inspiration was the Japanese documentary series Centuries of Picture. The final story was darker than many other Final Fantasy games. Despite its title change, the game was kept within the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. The approach taken with the mythos was to portray the roles of its deities from a historical standpoint, while telling a story focused on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of events. The cyclic nature of the game's universe was created to help incorporate aspects of the mythos. The roles and backgrounds for each character in the game were conceived and put into place after the setting and main story had been finalized. After the game's release, Tabata commented that when he was writing the story he would have liked to have been more thorough, and to have made the story easier for players to understand.|$|E

5000|$|The view of Jesus in {{the book}} could be {{inferred}} to be docetic. Thomas is not just Jesus' twin, he is Jesus' identical twin. As such, {{it is possible that}} Thomas is meant to represent <b>the</b> earthly, <b>human</b> <b>side</b> of Jesus, while Jesus is entirely spiritual in his being. In this way, Jesus directs Thomas' quest from heaven, while Thomas does the work on earth. For example, when the apostles are casting lots to choose where they will mission, Thomas initially refuses to go to India. However, Jesus appears in human form to sell Thomas as a slave to a merchant going to India, after which Jesus disappears.|$|R
