25|$|The {{history of}} Pau {{is marked by}} the birth of Henry of Bourbon 13 December 1553 in the castle of his grandparents.

With the end of Béarnaise independence in 1620, Pau lost its influence but remained the same at the head of a largely autonomous province. It was home to the Parliament of Navarre and Béarn which wrote its texts in Occitan until the Revolution and its dismantling to create the Department of Basses-Pyrénées (becoming Pyrénées-Atlantiques in 1969). It was during the 18th century when another famous person was born in Pau, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte who became Marshal of the Empire and King of Sweden (today, still the ruling dynasty) and Norway from 1818 until his death in 1844.|$|E

Dark and at times surreal, the novel is focused on alienation, bureaucracy, <b>the</b> <b>seemingly</b> <b>endless</b> frustrations of man's attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unobtainable goal. Hartmut M.

Hinde, a colour photographer, tried to find a way in which he could achieve the same or better effect with the addition of colour, something that would set his pictures apart from all the others. He hoped to capture the vividness of the Irish countryside, as well as the imagination of his audience.

The central phenomenon to be studied focuses on how school teachers “make sense” of educational reform as it occurs in their local contexts. In order to do this, an exploratory case study of two target schools that took part in policy reform initiatives directed at ubiquitous use of Information Communication and Technology (ICT) would be the locus of this inquiry. Using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as an analytical frame, for the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and interviews, this inquiry investigates and builds emerging explanations to school teachers’ sensemaking experiences in periods of reform...|$|R

The [...] "Colonial Ranch" [...] of the Midwest and Northeast is one such noted variant, adding American Colonial features to the facade of the California ranch house. Ranch houses of the 1940s and 1950s are typically more deliberately rustic in nature than those of the 1960s and 1970s, with features such as dovecotes, Swiss board edging on trim, and generally western and even fantasy trim styling. In the 1960s, the ranch house echoed the national trend towards sleekness in design, with the homes becoming even simpler as this trend continued.|$|E

Iowa's recycling projects were devised to alleviate the shortage of aggregates wherever they were found to have an economic advantage. We completed our first recycling project in 1976 on a 1. 4 project in Lyon county. The data collected in this project was used to schedule two additional projects in 1977. The larger of these two projects is located in Page and Taylor county on Highway # 2 and is approximately 15 miles in length. This material is to be crushed and re-used in the concrete paving, it is to be reconstructed on approximately the same alignment.

2500|$|GERMANY: Indo-German {{ties are}} transactional. The {{strategic}} relationship between Germany and India suffers from sustained anti-Asian sentiment, institutionalized discrimination against minority groups, and xenophobic incidents against Indians in Germany. The 2007 Mügeln mob attack on Indians and the 2015 Leipzig University internship controversy has clouded the predominantly commercial-oriented {{relationship between the}} two countries. Stiff competition between foreign manufactured goods within the Indian market has seen machine-tools, automotive parts and medical supplies from German Mittelstand ceding ground to high-technology imports manufactured by companies located in ASEAN & BRICS countries. The Volkswagen pollution control scandal drew the spotlight to corrupt behaviour in German boardrooms and brought back memories of the HDW bribery scandal surrounding the procurement of Shishumar-class submarines by the Indian Navy. The India-Germany strategic relationship is limited by the insignificance of German geopolitical influence in Asian affairs. Germany has no strategic footprint in Asia. The alignment of policies of the Institutions of the European Union in Brussels, where Germany increasingly controls the corridors of power, with Germany's vision of Europe and <b>the</b> <b>seemingly</b> <b>endless</b> hardships caused by tough German-backed austerity policies has led to large public-protests against the diktat of the ECB-EU-IMF troika [...] and drawn sharp criticism from prominent economists and political observers. Germany's bid for a permanent seat in a reformed United Nations Security Council (UNSC) faces several daunting obstacles: unforgotten memories from Germany's Nazi-era, Europe-wide unease over the resurgence of far-right political movements in Germany (AfD, NPD, PEGIDA) alongside an increase in violent attacks against foreigners, continuation of the frosty relationship with Russia, heightened concerns regarding the harsh and rigid political stance adopted by the government of Angela Merkel against Greece {{in the run-up to the}} 2015 Greek sovereign debt default, and defiant counter-proposals from the European members of the Coffee Club (Italy, Spain and Malta) on concerns of upsetting the post-WWII European balance of power.|$|E

With the solitary exception on the mountain-side, and of here and there a wind-row, along which the trees had been uprooted, by the furious blasts that sometimes sweep off acres of our trees in a minute, the eye could find no other object to study in the vast setting of this quiet rural picture, but <b>the</b> <b>seemingly</b> <b>endless</b> maze of wilderness. The broken surface of the land, however, limited the view to an horizon of no great extent, though the art of man could scarcely devise colors so vivid, or so gay, as those which were afforded by the brilliant hues of the foliage. The keen, biting frosts, known at the close of a New-England autumn, had already touched the broad and fringed leaves of the maples, and the sudden and secret process had been wrought upon all the other varieties of the forest, producing that magical effect, which can be nowhere seen, except in regions in which nature is so bountiful and luxuriant in summer, and so sudden and so stern in the change of the seasons.|$|E
