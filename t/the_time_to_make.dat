At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted {{that he could not}} have <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the mass-produced {{undergarment}} industry was booming, and competition forced producers {{to come up}} with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The Hanes company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s. Textile technology continued to improve, and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the shift}} of policy, the policy of {{evacuating}} Greek settlements and relocating the inhabitants was continued, albeit in a limited scale. The policy was targeted to specific regions that were considered militarily vulnerable, not {{the whole of the}} Greek population. As a 1919 Patriarchate account records, the evacuation of many villages was accompanied with looting and murders, while many {{died as a result of}} not having been given <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the necessary provisions or of being relocated to uninhabitable places.|$|E

25|$|The Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game was {{released}} in Europe in September 2006. The North American version was not released until June 2007, having been delayed {{so as to be}} released alongside the Xbox 360 port. However, Techland used <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some changes to the game; unlike the European version, which only supported DirectX 9.0c and was intended to run on Windows 2000 or Windows XP, the North American version was optimized for Windows Vista and DirectX 10, one of the first PC games optimized for the new operating system. Shortly after the release of the North American version, Techland released a DirectX 10 enhancement patch for all versions of the game.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} {{where it is}} critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker’s knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or surgeons. In these situations it is common that the key decision maker is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These ‘points of fracture’ are likely to cause additional workload on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013) In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.|$|E

25|$|Robertson lobbied {{hard with}} {{politicians}} and the press for the extension of conscription. When the Cabinet finally authorised the Somme Offensive, Robertson had the Army Council make a statement in favour of conscripting married men. In the face of protests from Bonar Law that the government might break up, {{to be followed by}} a General Election (which he thought would be divisive, even though the Conservatives would probably win) and conscription brought in by martial law, Robertson refused to compromise and encouraged Dawson, editor of <b>The</b> <b>Times,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his stance public. After poor relations between French and Kitchener had permitted civilian interference in strategy, Robertson was also determined to stand solid with Haig, telling him (26 April 1916) that they finally had the civilians “into a corner & have the upper hand”.|$|R

Online, Groening further commented on Gaga's appearance; [...] "The great thing about having Lady Gaga is that she came in a number of times and always with a different getup. Like she'd leave the room and come back in after a break in a completely new getup. It was unbelievable. The only time that she ever took off her hat was when it was banging into the microphone."

500|$|The sibling aliens Kang and Kodos first {{appeared}} on the show on this episode. Every Treehouse of Horror episode since this one must have Kang and Kodos as characters, states an unofficial Simpsons rule. Despite this rule, the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and then added at the last second, leading to brief appearances. The idea of Kang and Kodos came from Kogen and Wolodarsky. In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as [...] "an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo". The finished design {{was based on the}} cover of an EC Comics issue. Although originally designed to constantly drool, Groening suggested that they not drool all <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the animation process easier. However, the animators did not mind the work, leading to the drooling staying in the script. Kang and Kodos's names are derived from two [...] characters. Kang was a Klingon captain portrayed by actor Michael Ansara in the episode [...] "Day of the Dove", whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from [...] "The Conscience of the King". Harry Shearer voices Kang, and Dan Castellaneta voices Kodos.|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} Humongous, Soule met fellow {{employee}} and video game designer Chris Taylor, and {{signed on to}} compose the soundtrack to his major project, Total Annihilation. Soule convinced Taylor that, given {{the large amount of}} other real-time strategy games coming out {{at the same time as}} Total Annihilation with techno scores, that to separate themselves they needed to do a large orchestral score. He went so far as to bet a year's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music. Given the software limitations at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the sound work correctly required a full live orchestra, the first that Soule had ever worked with; the orchestral tracks in Evermore had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves, two instruments at a time. The soundtrack earned Soule his first award, that of [...] "Best Music" [...] of 1997 from GameSpot in their year-end awards. Soule spent the next two years composing music for the game's two expansion packs and for children's games.|$|E

500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{was first}} {{revealed}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, with IGN giving the game their Best Nintendo DS Game of E3 award. When Nintendo received negative feedback at E3 2005 about the game's {{lack of an}} online feature, the company announced in August 2005 that the game's release would be delayed to give the developers time to implement Nintendo WFC support. After the game's release was delayed to give NST time to implement the multiplayer feature, the developers took <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more changes. They worked on the game's framerate to make the graphics move more smoothly. The game's visuals were improved; a developer added reflections to the Morph Ball. The other developers admired the effect, and added it {{to other parts of}} the game. NST collaborated with Retro Studios, the company behind several Metroid games, to design the game's art and characters to make sure that they fit into the overall Metroid series. When asked why Metroid Prime Hunters was placed between Metroid Prime and [...] chronologically, Reed noted that the game was not influenced by the story of either game, so there were no continuity issues. He described Hunters as a side story to the Metroid Prime series.|$|E
500|$|New {{contracts}} for returning cast members were made, as {{the actors and}} actresses had signed for only two films. Hugh Jackman's contract included the approval of director, initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky, {{with whom he had}} just finished filming on The Fountain. Joss Whedon, whose comic book [...] "Gifted" [...] was integrated into the script's plot, turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film. Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to be up for consideration, though Proyas personally turned it down, citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing I, Robot. Zack Snyder was also approached, but he was already committed to 300. Peter Berg was also considered to direct the film but he too turned down the job. In February 2005, with still no director hired, Fox announced a May 5, 2006, release date, with filming to start in July 2005 in Vancouver. One month later, the studio signed Matthew Vaughn to direct, and pushed the release date three weeks to May 26, Memorial Day weekend. Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Dania Ramirez as Callisto, and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began. Vaughn was also cautious of the tight deadlines imposed by Fox, stating that he [...] "didn't have <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the movie that I wanted to make". John Moore was also considered to direct the film at one point.|$|E
500|$|A rather better-known {{example of}} the {{awarding}} of a flitch of bacon to married couples occurred at Little Dunmow Priory in Essex. [...] It is generally held to have been instituted by the family of Robert Fitzwalter in the 13th century. [...] According to Rev. W. W. Skeat in his notes to the fourteenth-century The Vision of William Concerning Piers the Plowman, In the present passage we have the earliest known allusion to the singular custom known as that of [...] "the Dunmow flitch of Bacon." [...] The custom was—"that if any pair could, after a twelvemonth of matrimony, come forward, and make oath at Dunmow [...] that, during the whole time, they {{had never had a}} quarrel, never regretted their marriage, and, if again open to an engagement, would make exactly that they had made, they should be rewarded with a flitch of Bacon." [...] It is referred to in Chaucer (1343–1400) {{in a way that makes}} clear the reference would already be well known to the reader. [...] It continued to be awarded until the middle of the 18th century, the last successful claim being made on 20 June 1751. [...] The ceremony of this last flitch award was recorded by the artist David Ogborne who was present at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sketches and, later, engravings. [...] His images were later used as source material by Ainsworth for his novel, The Flitch of Bacon. [...] Ainsworth's 1854 novel proved so popular that it revived the custom which has continued in one form or another down to the present day and is now held every leap year.|$|E

Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever."
