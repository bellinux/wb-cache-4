5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the <b>Taliban</b> from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the <b>Taliban</b> was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} <b>Taliban</b> had returned. In 2006, the <b>Taliban</b> insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December 2013, Captain Richard Holloway {{was serving}} with the SBS {{when he was}} killed by <b>Taliban</b> small arms fire while {{conducting}} an operation to suppress the <b>Taliban</b> in a joint SBS-Afghan forces raid (with air support) on <b>Taliban</b> insurgents in a valley east of Kabul ahead of the Afghanistan elections.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and from a nearby position by <b>Taliban</b> armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US {{troops on the ground}} with close air support, killing two fleeing <b>Taliban.</b> The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six <b>Taliban</b> gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the <b>Taliban.</b> Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the <b>Taliban</b> fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the <b>Taliban</b> insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the <b>Taliban</b> fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by <b>Taliban</b> fighters.|$|E
5|$|During the 2001 {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, A-10s {{did not take}} part in the initial stages. For the campaign against <b>Taliban</b> and Al Qaeda, A-10 squadrons were deployed to Pakistan and Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, beginning in March 2002. These A-10s participated in Operation Anaconda. Afterwards, A-10s remained in-country, fighting <b>Taliban</b> and Al Qaeda remnants.|$|E
5|$|Enqiadi, {{reported}} to be a <b>Taliban</b> commander prior to the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, NATO {{forces in}} southeastern Afghanistan {{deployed}} sub-company-sized patrols to the Pakistan border to disrupt supplies flowing to the <b>Taliban</b> from the Federally Administered Tribal Regions of Pakistan. They established small patrol bases, which came under regular attack by <b>Taliban</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with <b>Taliban</b> forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a <b>Taliban</b> bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the <b>Taliban</b> to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Mullah Rahim Akhund, <b>Taliban</b> {{governor}} of Helmand province, mistakenly reported captured.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 2008, <b>Taliban</b> leader Mullah Abdul Matin {{and one of}} his sub-commanders, Mullah Karim Agha, {{along with}} several bodyguards were {{travelling}} through the desert near Gereshk, Helmand province on motorbikes when they were ambushed and killed by an SBS unit dropped into his path by helicopter. In February 2009, members of the SBS took part in Operation Diesel, which resulted in the seizure of £50 million of heroin and the killing of at least 20 <b>Taliban</b> insurgents. On 9 September 2009, an SBS team supported by the SFSG rescued Times journalist Stephen Farrell after he and his Afghan interpreter were captured by the <b>Taliban</b> whilst reporting on the Kunduz airstrike and were held at a <b>Taliban</b> safe house in Char Dara District, Kunduz Province. The British special forces were forced to act when signal intercepts of <b>Taliban</b> leader showed them discussing moving the hostages into Pakistan. They were inserted by 160th SOAR helicopters at pre-dawn directly onto the target building, whilst the SFSG set up a cordon, the Afghan interpreter was accidentally shot and killed as was two civilians by an explosive breaching charge on the compound, whilst a soldier from the SFSG was killed, Farrell was rescued. On 1 July 2010 whilst carrying out an operation against insurgents in Haji Wakil, Helmand Province, Corporal Seth Stephens of the SBS was killed during a heavy firefight whilst clearing a compound, {{as a result of his}} actions during that operation, he was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. On 15 April 2012, during the <b>Taliban</b> attack on Kabul SBS member cleared <b>Taliban</b> militants from a central location overlooking foreign embassies.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 2001, the War in Afghanistan {{began when}} U.S. and British forces {{initiated}} aerial bombing campaigns targeting <b>Taliban</b> and al-Qaeda camps, then later invaded Afghanistan with ground {{troops of the}} Special Forces. This {{eventually led to the}} overthrow of the <b>Taliban</b> rule of Afghanistan with the Fall of Kandahar on December 7, 2001, by U.S. led coalition forces. Conflict in Afghanistan between the <b>Taliban</b> insurgency and the Afghan forces backed by NATO Resolute Support Mission is ongoing. The Philippines and Indonesia, among other nations with their own internal conflicts with Islamic terrorism, also increased their military readiness.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze <b>Taliban</b> operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The <b>Taliban,</b> however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the <b>Taliban</b> in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, Laila {{gives birth to}} Zalmai, Rasheed's son. The <b>Taliban</b> has risen to power and imposed harsh rules on the Afghan population, prohibiting women from {{appearing}} in public without a male relative. There is a drought, and living conditions in Kabul become poor. Rasheed's workshop burns down, and he is forced to take jobs {{for which he is}} ill-suited. He sends Aziza to an orphanage. Laila endures a number of beatings from the <b>Taliban</b> when caught alone on the streets in attempts to visit her daughter.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and {{cooperation with the}} <b>Taliban.</b> Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy policies in the mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and gas pipelines to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through Afghanistan to an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the <b>Taliban,</b> raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise of <b>Taliban</b> control in Afghanistan to advance U.S. energy interests in the region.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three hours of the fight, the U.S. troops {{remained}} under intense mortar and small arms fire, before the <b>Taliban</b> fighters breached the compound and set fire to it. Romesha moved under heavy fire to reconnoiter the area and seek reinforcements from a nearby barracks, helping the ISAF force to regroup and fight despite being targeted by a <b>Taliban</b> sniper. Romesha led the firefight to reclaim the depot, organizing a five-man team to counterattack while still under fire. He then neutralized one of the <b>Taliban</b> fighters' machine gun teams. While engaging a second, he took cover behind a generator which {{was struck by a}} rocket propelled grenade, and Romesha was wounded in the neck, shoulder and arms by shrapnel. Despite being wounded, Romesha directed air support that killed an estimated 30 <b>Taliban</b> and then took out several more <b>Taliban</b> positions himself. He provided suppressive fire to allow three other wounded American soldiers to reach an aid station and then recovered several American casualties while still under fire. Romesha's efforts allowed the troop to regroup and fight off a force superior in numbers. The fight lasted 12 hours, and eight American soldiers were killed, making the engagement one of the costliest for ISAF forces during the war. Nine soldiers were decorated with Silver Star Medals for the fight. Several days later, the ISAF forces withdrew from the post.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the <b>Taliban</b> insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the <b>Taliban,</b> one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from the <b>Taliban</b> fighters.|$|E
5|$|Mullah Ahmadullah, <b>Taliban</b> {{commander}} who {{spoke with the}} Associated Press during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Mullah Faizullah, deputy <b>Taliban</b> shadow {{governor}} of Helmand province, {{killed in an}} airstrike.|$|E
5|$|Mullah Matin Akhund (also {{known as}} Abdul Matin), <b>Taliban</b> {{district}} chief of Musa Qala, mistakenly reported captured.|$|E
5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by the <b>Taliban</b> {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the Sharia. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The <b>Taliban</b> also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous <b>Taliban</b> rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Norgrove's captors {{demanded the}} release of Aafia Siddiqui in {{exchange}} for her return. The <b>Taliban</b> released the three Afghans on 3 October 2010 during negotiations. The United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group conducted a predawn rescue attempt five days later on the <b>Taliban</b> mountain hideout where Norgrove was held captive, amid concerns {{that she would be}} killed or moved by her kidnappers. US forces killed several kidnappers and three local farmers during the assault. They subsequently located Norgrove, badly wounded in a nearby gully, and she died later from her injuries.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 2012, a {{group of}} 50 Islamic clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwā – a ruling of Islamic law – against the <b>Taliban</b> gunmen who tried to kill Yousafzai. Islamic {{scholars}} from the Sunni Ittehad Council publicly denounced attempts by the Pakistani <b>Taliban</b> to mount religious justifications for the shooting of Yousafzai and two of her classmates.|$|E
5|$|Other Afghan sources {{denied any}} link to Osman. US {{military}} sources identified Norgrove's captors as Kunar <b>Taliban,</b> and British Foreign Secretary William Hague {{said they were}} from a Salafist group affiliated with the local <b>Taliban,</b> known as Jamaat al Dawa al Quran. An Afghan intelligence official later identified her captors as local commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan. Negotiations for Norgrove's release were conducted through local tribal elders.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with the <b>Taliban</b> were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the <b>Taliban,</b> was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The <b>Taliban</b> did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the <b>Taliban</b> shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the <b>Taliban</b> in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with <b>Taliban</b> representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taliban</b> forces took up new {{positions}} {{to defend the}} town on 9 December. <b>Taliban</b> sources suggested {{at the time that}} militants from nearby areas were entering the town to reinforce its defence. Fighting was on-going through the day and bombs planted by insurgents continued to take a toll on ISAF forces: an American soldier, Corporal Tanner J O'Leary of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was killed by the detonation of an improvised explosive device.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Musa Qala (also Qaleh or Qal'eh) was a British led {{military}} action in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan, launched by the Afghan National Army and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) against the <b>Taliban</b> on 7 December 2007. After three days of intense fighting, the <b>Taliban</b> retreated into the mountains on 10 December. Musa Qala was officially reported captured on 12 December, with Afghan Army troops pushing into the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Taliban</b> {{surrounded}} the remote base and its observation post, attacking it from Quam and surrounding farmland. They destroyed {{much of the}} U.S. heavy munitions, broke through American lines, and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft. The United States claimed to have killed at least 21 <b>Taliban</b> fighters {{for the loss of}} nine U.S. soldiers killed and 27 wounded, and four Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers wounded.|$|E
5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan <b>Taliban,</b> the Haqqani network, the Pakistani <b>Taliban</b> and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>Taliban</b> {{fighters were}} in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The <b>Taliban</b> fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed the wounds of the two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Various <b>Taliban</b> {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched <b>Taliban</b> positions. At the same time, the first civilians started {{to return to the}} area, some with reports of <b>Taliban</b> punishments and claims of active Pakistani and Arab jihadis. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to use military force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} before the 2000 Summer Olympics, the IOC offered the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee the {{opportunity}} to send a contingent to the Games without the <b>Taliban</b> flag. The Committee declined to take part on this condition.|$|E
5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the <b>Taliban</b> government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} <b>Taliban</b> government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|After boys' schools reopened, the <b>Taliban</b> lifted {{restrictions}} on girls' primary education, {{where there was}} co-education. Girls-only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended, out of 700 pupils who were enrolled.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{attacks in}} the United States, Saleh participated in leading {{intelligence}} operations of the United Front on the ground during the toppling of the <b>Taliban</b> regime.|$|E
5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{has been}} {{speaking}} and writing extensively {{on these issues}} in both local and international media. He maintains that the <b>Taliban</b> need to disarm and honor {{the integrity of the}} Afghan constitution before they could be considered for any reconciliation process.|$|E
