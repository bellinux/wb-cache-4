The cooling efficiency of a Hydro-Vac cooler was slightly lower than that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch <b>tubular</b> surface <b>cooler.</b> The cooling efficiency of a sprinkler cooler was found to be higher than that of a tub cooler, but the cooling efficiency of either one of these two coolers was considerably lower than that of a Hydro-Vac cooler. When a Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> and a <b>tubular</b> surface <b>cooler</b> were thoroughly cleaned and sterilized there was no difference of' practical significance in the bacterial contamination of the milk by these two coolers. The flavor and odor of milk <b>cooled</b> with a <b>tubular</b> surface <b>cooler</b> or with a Hydro-Vac cooler was on an average slightly superior to the flavor and odor of milk from the same lot which was cooled with a tub cooler or with a sprinkler cooler. No difference was observed in the volume of cream forming on milk from the same lot when the milk was <b>cooled</b> with a <b>tubular</b> surface <b>cooler</b> or with a Hydro-Vac cooler or when it was not cooled.

40|$|Pellet {{heat and}} mass {{transfer}} coefficients inside packed beds {{do not have}} definite deterministic values, but are stochastic quantities with a certain distribution. Here, a method is presented to incorporate the stochastic distribution of pellet properties in reactor design and operation models. The theory presented is illustrated {{with a number of}} examples. It is shown that pellet-scale statistics have an impact on <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor design and operation. <b>Cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor design is determined to a large extent by the objective that run away inside the reactor tubes be avoided. We obtain the highest conversion if conditions in the tubes are such that the pellet and reactor run-away mechanisms are in balance. This determines an optimum amount of particles on a diameter inside a <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor. This optimum is influenced by the distribution of transport coefficients over the pellets. Because of the pellet-scale statistical behaviour, a certain percentage of the tubes will always suffer run away if we operate close to the run-away region. If we have certain fluctuations in the coolant temperature, reactor pressure or load, any of these can damage a certain amount of tubes. As these fluctuations occur often, the performance of the <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor will deteriorate with time. The effects, as shown in this study, may cause an increase in inherent reactor instability. Therefore, if these effects are taken into account, a more conservative reactor design emerges...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Passenger {{vehicles}} {{fueled by}} hydrocarbons or alcohols and powered by proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells address world air quality and fuel supply concerns while avoiding hydrogen infrastructure and on-board storage problems. Reduction {{of the carbon}} monoxide concentration in the on-board fuel processor’s hydrogen-rich gas by the preferential oxidizer (PrOx) under dynamic conditions is crucial to avoid poisoning of the PEM fuel cell’s anode catalyst and thus malfunction of the fuel-cell vehicle. A dynamic control scheme is proposed for a single-stage <b>tubular</b> <b>cooled</b> PrOx that performs better than, but retains the reliability {{and ease of use}} of, conventional industrial controllers. The proposed hybrid control system contains a cerebellar model articulation controller artificial neural network in parallel with a conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. A computer simulation of the preferential oxidation reactor was used to assess the abilities of the proposed controller and compare its performance to the performance of conventional controllers. Realistic input patterns were generated for the PrOx by using models of vehicle power demand and upstream fuel-processor components to convert the speed sequences in the Federal Urban Driving Schedule to PrOx inlet temperatures, concentrations, and flow rates. The proposed hybrid controller generalizes well to novel driving sequences after being trained on other driving sequences with similar or slower transients. Although it is similar to the PID in terms of software requirements and design effort, the hybrid controller performs significantly better than the PID in terms of hydrogen conversion setpoint regulation and PrOx outlet carbon monoxide reduction.

40|$|Several {{problems}} and pitfalls {{in the use}} of laboratory reactors for the determination of the kinetics of ethene epoxidation over industrial silver on α-alumina catalyst are discussed. Also, commonly used methodologies for kinetic studies are dealt with because of the general nature of some problems. Some advice is given in choosing and using the appropriate reactor type. Further, a method is discussed to determine kinetics in a <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor without having to use heat transport relations. The activation and deactivation of the silver catalyst have been studied in a Berty-type reactor, in a novel internal recycle reactor and in a <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor. It was found necessary to activate the silver catalyst for approximately 170 reaction hours under reaction conditions to obtain a stable and reproducible catalyst activity. Thermal sintering was probably of importance in experiments at the maximum temperature of 543 K. Deliberate addition of small amounts of 1, 2 -dichloroethane resulted in rapid deactivation of the catalyst. The activity could be restored by addition of small amounts of ethane to the feed. Also, fluorine and silica have been shown to poison the catalyst. Differences in the behaviour of the catalyst in the three reactors may be attributed to the sensitivity of the catalyst towards tiny amounts of poisons present in the reactors and feed mixtures used...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the selective}} oxidation of ethene in air over an industrial silver on ¿-alumina catalyst were studied. Special attention {{was paid to}} the influence of the reaction products on the reaction rates of epoxidation and complete combustion. Kinetic data were obtained in two different types of internal recycle reactor and in a <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor, and were fitted separately to several reaction rate expressions based on different kinetic models. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which adsorbed ethene reacts with adsorbed molecular oxygen, was chosen as the best kinetic model. The reaction products compete for adsorption on the active sites and reduce the rates of both reactions. Carbon dioxide enhances the selectivity towards ethene oxide, whereas water has almost no influence on the selectivity. The fitting of the three individual data sets obtained in the three reactors results in accurate, but different, reaction rate expressions, whereas the fitting of the three data sets simultaneously results in less accurate reaction rate expressions. The systematic deviations found may be explained, to some extent, by differences in the operating regimes in each reactor. The main reason for the deviations is probably the different catalyst activities in the three reactors caused by poisoning. The effect of the addition of products to the feed on the behaviour of the <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor can be described reasonably well by a mathematical model in which the kinetic equations obtained in the laboratory reactors are incorporated. The results of these simulations are sensitive to the kinetics used...|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} the pseudo-homogeneous, one-dimensional, <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor is applied to two consecutive, {{irreversible}} first order reactions. A criterion is derived to obtain a desired integral yield. Based on this criterion three requirements are formulated, which enable us to choose the relevant design and operating conditions. If any of the requirements are met, the reactor is also safe with respect to runaway. In an illustration the results are applied {{to the production of}} phthalic anhydride via the oxidation of naphthalene. It is shown that the requirements formulated can be used for the design of the reactor and for its immediate adjustment to a change in operating conditions. In view of the special behaviour of consecutive reactions in a tubular reactor a fine tuning of the operating conditions remains necessary after this adjustment...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} of the one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model of the <b>cooled</b> <b>tubular</b> reactor is studied. Using the two-dimensional model as the more accurate one we compared both models by studying {{the influence of the}} design and operating variables on the conditions in the hot spot of the reactor. The effects were studied on an analytical basis, and a relation is derived that describes the radial temperature profile in the hot spot of the reactor. In the first section we present the model equations and discuss the results obtained from a numerical evaluation. In the second section we compare mean and maximum radial temperatures and reaction rates in case a single exothermic reaction is carried out. We conclude that—for reactors operating in the steady state—in the hot spot the one-dimensional model predicts the proper temperature when it is compared with the average temperature calculated by the two-dimensional model, although large differences may arise between maximum and mean radial temperature. A new method is presented to obtain the maximum radial temperature in the hot spot directly from the results of the one-dimensional model. It was found that there can be large differences between the actual average reaction rate and the reaction rate at mean temperature as obtained from the one-dimensional model...|$|R
