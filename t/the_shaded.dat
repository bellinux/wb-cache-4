Those two last species are also in the Calamagrostide's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch, with moor club (Clavaria argillacea), Geoglossum cookeanum, lilac leg fibrecap (Inocybe griseolilacina), (Stropharia pseudocyanea), girdled knight (Tricholoma cingulatum) and burnt knight (Tricholoma ustale). Near orchid stations in the pioneer wood exist golden spindles (Clavulinopsis fusiformis), Hebeloma clavulipes, Hebeloma fusipes, Hebeloma pusillum, and also lilac leg fibrecap and burnt knight.

40|$|Background: Knowledge on {{microclimate}} {{conditions under}} artificial shades in a ginseng field would facilitate climate-aware management of ginseng production. Methods: Weather data were measured under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> and outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> at two fields located in Gochang-gun and Jeongeup-si, Korea, in 2011 and 2012 seasons to assess {{temperature and humidity}} conditions under <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> An empirical approach was developed and validated for the estimation of leaf wetness duration (LWD) using weather measurements outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> as inputs to the model. Results: Air temperature and relative humidity were similar between under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> and outside <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> For example, temperature conditions favorable for ginseng growth, e. g., between 8 °C and 27 °C, occurred slightly less frequently in hours during night times under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> (91 %) than outside (92 %). Humidity conditions favorable for development of a foliar disease, e. g., relative humidity > 70 %, occurred slightly more frequently under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> (84 %) than outside (82 %). Effectiveness of correction schemes to an empirical LWD model differed by rainfall conditions for the estimation of LWD under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> using weather measurements outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> as inputs to the model. During dew eligible days, a correction scheme to an empirical LWD model was slightly effective (10 %) in reducing estimation errors under <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> However, another correction approach during rainfall eligible days reduced errors of LWD estimation by 17 %. Conclusion: Weather measurements outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> and LWD estimates derived from these measurements would be useful as inputs for decision support systems to predict ginseng growth and disease development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Broadband field {{measurements}} were conducted beneath three different sized public shade structures, small, medium and large, during the Southern Hemisphere winter. These measurements {{were compared to}} the diffuse UV to quantify {{the relationship of the}} UV under and around <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structures to <b>the</b> diffuse UV. For <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structures, a relationship between the diffuse UV and the UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> has been provided for clear skies and solar zenith angles (SZAs) of 49 o to 76 o. This allows the prediction of the UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of these structures if the diffuse UV is known. The ultraviolet protection factors (UPFs) for <b>the</b> three <b>shade</b> structures ranged from 1. 5 to 5. 4 for decreasing SZA. For the greater SZAs of 70 o to 76 o, the erythemal UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> was 65 %, 59 % and 51 % of that in full sun for the small, medium and large structures respectively. For the smaller SZAs of 50 o to 53 o the erythemal UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> was 35 %, 41 % and 18 % for the small, medium and large shade structures respectively.

For <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> umbrella placed on dry grass the time able to be spent in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> in <b>the</b> middle of the day before experiencing mild erythema increased from 35 to 60 minutes as the solar zenith angle increased from 33 o to 52 o.
