5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax,</b> which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E
25|$|Designed by economists at the Hoover Institution, Hall–Rabushka is a {{flat tax}} on {{consumption}}.

25|$|One type of {{flat tax}} would {{be imposed on}} all income once; at {{the source of the}} income. Hall and Rabushka (1995) {{includes}} a proposed amendment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that would implement the variant of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> they advocate. This amendment, only a few pages long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is not directed at specifying graduated tax rates).|$|E
25|$|The Russian Federation is {{considered}} a prime case {{of the success of}} a flat tax; the real revenues from its Personal Income Tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the Federation introduced a flat tax, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year. The Laffer curve predicts such an outcome, attributing the primary reason for the greater revenue to higher levels of economic growth stemming from the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wyden is {{critical}} of the estate tax, which he feels is inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower the capital gains tax, to encourage the study of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax,</b> and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. However, Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against the balanced budget amendment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>tax</b> {{benefits}} {{higher income}} brackets progressively due to decline in marginal value. For example, if a <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> system {{has a large}} per-citizen deductible (such as the [...] "Armey" [...] scheme below), then it is a progressive tax.

50|$|Alvin Rabushka (born May 15, 1940) is an American {{political}} scientist.

25|$|However, this {{simplicity}} {{depends on}} the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax,</b> the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E
500|$|Although Friedman {{never visited}} Estonia, his book Free to Choose {{exercised}} a great influence on that nation's then 32-year-old prime minister, Mart Laar, who has claimed {{that it was}} the only book on economics he had read before taking office. Laar's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the [...] "Baltic Tiger." [...] A prime element of Laar's program was introduction of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax.</b> Laar won the 2006 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty, awarded by the Cato Institute.|$|E
500|$|Kemp championed several Chicago {{school and}} supply-side {{economics}} issues: economic growth, free markets, free trade, tax simplification and lower tax rates on both employment and investment income. He was a long-time proponent of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax.</b> He also defended {{the use of}} anti-Communist contra forces in Central America, supported the gold standard, spoke for civil rights legislation, opposed abortion, {{and was the first}} lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones, which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants. During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat: he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants. [...] The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert Kennedy. He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs. For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party, David Gergen heralded him as a [...] "courageous voice in the wilderness." [...] Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools. Kemp at times felt his role was that of [...] "freewheeling, entrepreneurial, wildcatting backbencher." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>flat</b> income <b>tax</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular recently, yet its implementation is limited to Eastern Europe. We analyse the distributional and e? ciency effects of <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> scenarios for Western European countries.

50|$|The {{effort for}} {{reporting}} and supervision can be significantly reduced by combining basic income with <b>flat</b> income <b>tax.</b> <b>The</b> relationship between gross and net income for individuals {{can be adjusted}} to correspond roughly to current relationship at all income levels, implying that income tax is effectively progressive. A flat rate income taxation with tax exemption implements a negative income tax as well as maintaining an actual tax rate progression at extremely low administrative cost. This is achieved by paying a tax on the tax exemption to all taxpayers, e.g. in monthly payments. The tax on the tax exemption is computed by applying <b>the</b> nominal <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> rate to <b>the</b> exemption. The tax on the income is drawn directly from the source, e.g. from an employer. The tax on income is computed by applying <b>the</b> nominal <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> rate to <b>the</b> income.|$|R

2500|$|In Estonia, {{which has}} had a flat tax since 1994 (rate has been 20% since 2015, and used to be 21-26%), {{studies have shown that}} the {{significant}} increase in tax revenue experienced was caused partly by a disproportionately rising VAT revenue. Moreover, Estonia and Slovakia have high social contributions, pegged to wage levels. Both matters raise questions regarding the justice of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> system, and thus its long-term political sustainability. The Estonian economist and former chairman of his country's parliamentary budget committee Olev Raju, stated in September 2005 that [...] "income disparities are rising and calls for a progressive system of taxation are getting louder – this could put an end to <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> after the next election". However, this did not happen, because after the 2007 elections a right-wing coalition was formed which stated its will to keep <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> in existence.

50|$|A {{consumption}} tax {{is a tax}} on spending on goods and services. The tax base of such a tax is {{the money spent on}} consumption.

25|$|In 1989, Edgar L. Feige {{proposed}} a synthesis and {{extension of the}} ideas of Keynes and Tobin by proposing a <b>flat</b> rate <b>tax</b> on all transactions. The total volume of all transactions undertaken in an economy represents the broadest possible tax base and therefore requires <b>the</b> lowest <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> rate to raise any requisite amount of revenue. Since financial transactions in stocks, bonds, international currency transactions and derivatives comprise most of the automated payment transaction (APT) tax base, it is in essence the broadest of financial transaction taxes. Initially {{proposed a}}s a revenue neutral replacement for the entire Federal tax system of the United States, it could alternatively {{be considered as a}} global tax whose revenues could be used by national governments to reduce existing income, corporate and VAT tax rates as well as reducing existing sovereign debt burdens. If adopted by all of the developed nations, it would have the advantage of eliminating all incentives for substitution between financial assets and between financial centers since all transactions would universally be <b>taxed</b> at <b>the</b> identical <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> rate.|$|R
50|$|A direct, {{personal}} {{consumption tax}} {{may take the}} form of an expenditure tax or an income tax that deducts savings and investments, such as <b>the</b> Hall-Rabushka <b>flat</b> <b>tax.</b> A direct consumption tax may be called an expenditure tax, a cash-flow tax, or a consumed-income tax and can be flat or progressive. Expenditure taxes have been briefly implemented in the past in India and Sri Lanka.|$|R
2500|$|Flat tax {{plans that}} are {{presently}} being advanced in the United States also seek to redefine [...] "sources of income"; current progressive taxes count interest, dividends and capital gains as income, for example, while Steve Forbes's variant of <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> {{would apply to}} wages only.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Giuliani criticized a {{proposal}} by presidential candidate Steve Forbes {{for a national}} flat tax, saying its elimination of deductions {{for state and local}} income taxes would unfairly punish high-tax states such as New York and added that <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> [...] "would really be a disaster." ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, the {{question}} of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> design; deductions dramatically affect the effective [...] "flatness" [...] in the tax rate. Perhaps the single biggest necessary deduction is for business expenses. If businesses were not allowed to deduct expenses, businesses with a profit margin below <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> rate could never earn any money since the tax on revenues would always exceed the earnings. For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. Thus, corporations must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individual citizens cannot. A practical dilemma now arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business.|$|E
5000|$|CBO {{estimated}} in 2010 that removing {{the cap on}} the payroll tax (i.e., making all income subject to <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> payroll <b>tax</b> rate) would fully fund the program for 75 years.

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>tax</b> {{implementations}} without <b>the</b> {{provision of}} a negative income tax actually need an additional effort {{in order to avoid}} negative taxation.
