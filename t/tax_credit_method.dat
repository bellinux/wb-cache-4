40|$|Value added tax (VAT) {{is often}} {{described}} as a regressive tax because it taxes consumption, and the propensity to consume tends to decrease as income rises. Countries that maintain progressive tax systems take several measures to remove the regressivity of VAT. These measures include (i) exempting food and social necessities and (ii) taxing luxuries at high rates and necessities at low rates. VAT of the subtraction type has two main variants, namely the <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> <b>method</b> and the subtraction method. These two types of VAT have theoretically the same effects on a firm’s liability for VAT and a firm’s decision on price in cases where there is only one rate and there are no exemptions. However, in cases where multiple rates and exemptions 3 are implemented, these two types of VAT no longer have the same effects on a firm’s liability for VAT and a firm’s decision on price. In the European Union, multiple rates are used to mitigate the regressivity of VAT in several countries. 4 In a recent EU Directive, the EU proposed a dual-rate structure, namely a standard rate of at least 15 per cent and a minimum rate of at least 5 per cent. Also proposed was the abolition of internal border controls by switching from the destination principle to the origin principle. This means that each Member State can set its own VAT rates to mitigate regressivity and to secure its revenue. 5...|$|E
40|$|Interest {{deduction}} limitation {{rules have}} an important function as the regulations prevent the Swedish tax base to decrease. However, the restrictions must not be {{at the expense of}} the business environment. Interest deduction limitation rules that do not work in a satisfactory manner are likely to make Sweden a less favourable country to establish in.   The first Swedish rules which were aimed to restrict interest deduction threaded into force in 2009. The rules were applicable to intercompany loans related to acquisitions of part ownership rights and the aim was to reduce tax avoidance through corporate group-loans. The rules proved to be ineffective since the avoidance continued and the Swedish rules could not tackle the problem. The rules were revised and in 2013 Sweden implemented new restrictions regarding interest deduction rules that were applicable to corporate group-loans, regardless of what the loan would be used for. The new rules were strongly criticized by several consultive bodies for being unpredictable for the liable of    taxation. The rules have also been criticized by the European Court of Justice for breaches EU law. A future modification of the existing interest deduction limitation rules is therefore highly likely.   The present thesis presents two alternative approaches to the Swedish interest deduction limitation rules, thin capitalization rules and the <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> <b>method,</b> which is a new proposal by Sven-Olof Lodin. Sweden should wait to introduce thin capitalization rules since the rules in several member states have been criticized for not being compatible with EU law. Furthermore, it is stated in the thesis that thin capitalization rules will not remove the incentive for tax planning. This is because companies can easily customize loan to not exceed the ratio of the relationship between equity and internal debt, which governs whether a company is thin capitalized or not. The advantage of the thin capitalization rules is that they could possibly increase the predictability of the rules and that the rules can be quite legally secure. Another advantage is that thin capitalization rules could contribute to an international harmonization of tax rules regarding corporate group-loans, since it is a common practice in other member states. Although, the benefits do not weigh up for the disadvantages and Sweden is therefore recommended to wait to implement the thin capitalization rules.   The proposal from Lodin to introduce a tax credit system is something that Sweden is recommended examining. The advantage of the system is that it is the most effective, out of the three methods, since the system removes the incentive to tax planning. Since the rules is not a deduction method but instead a reduction method, the lending company's corporation tax is not an essential factor in raising loans. This creates tax neutrality for the corporate group. Since the rules have not been introduced in any member states, it is difficult to compare the rules with other rules as well as to get a full picture of what disadvantages such rules could result in.   The thesis shows that the problem is not to develop rules that effectively prevent tax avoidance with corporate group-loans. More problematic is it for countries to develop rules that are compatible with EU law and protects an attractive business environment. Sweden is in need of a system that has a better balance between protecting the interest of an attractive business environment and at the same time protects the Swedish tax base. The thesis presents a set of advantages and disadvantages focused on different methods and it does not exist an obvious method to replace the current Swedish rules. Although, the final recommendation of the thesis is to examine Lodins methods of preventing tax avoidance more closely. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discussions on Japanese tax system reform includes how consumption tax (Value-added tax) system ought to be. Facing issues like depopulation, aging society and large budget deficit, consumption tax can be an effective source of revenue to secure social security. This article mainly focuses on multiple tax rates and input <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> <b>methods</b> of Japanese consumption tax system. Because of regressive nature of consumption tax, tax rate reduction, exemption on foodstuffs or daily necessities, and "invoice-based credit method" under which input <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> is only allowed with invoice have been largely discussed. There are many difficulties in implementation of multiple tax system. Whereas "invoice-based credit method" would promote transparency of the system, so called "account-based method" of Japanese consumption tax under which the amount of tax is calculated based on the record of accounting books has advantages that enterprises are motivated to keep correct accounting and eliminate tax accumulation even if an exempt business lies in a transaction chain, and they can reduce cost on work or administration. In light of this, the consumption tax based on "account-based method" should be discussed further in order to promote reliable and transparent tax system...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a scoping study {{to understand more}} {{about the nature of}} the 'costs of compliance' that claimants of social security benefits and (personal) <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> incur, and discusses possible ways of measuring such costs. 'Costs of compliance' refers to the costs - time, money and psychological costs - that are imposed on applicants for, and recipients of, benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> and on others by meeting all the various requirements placed on them by social security and <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> law and statutory authorities. Our main purpose in this report is to make the case for taking compliance costs into account in considering the impact of, and changes to, benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> The study aimed to investigate the extent to which the principles underlying methods of establishing 'costs of compliance' in other areas can be applied to applicants for, and recipients of, benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> These existing <b>methods</b> include valuing individuals' and companies' administrative costs of complying with the tax authorities; valuing companies' costs in complying with government regulations; and estimating the time spent by individuals in complying with government regulations of various kinds. But we also think it is important for governments to consider claimants' own perceptions and priorities in terms of the 'costs of compliance'. Currently, the government recommends that cost-benefit analysis should be used when assessing the impact of potential policy changes and it produces guidance for departments on how to put this into practice. New impact assessments have been introduced recently, which, in principle, should take into account the monetary value of all the effects of changes, including allocating a value to non-market items such as people's time. This kind of assessment should therefore include analysis of the 'costs of compliance' for benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> claimants. In practice, however, impact assessments do not usually include such exercises. It is important to know about the scale and distribution of the compliance costs of benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> as well as taxes, for several reasons. Time spent by recipients fulfilling their obligations cannot be spent engaged in other activities; a more rounded measure of the productivity of the benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> system would include such costs; and we could understand more about the reasons behind non-take-up of entitlements. There could be advantages, too, in terms of improving citizens' relationship with government. A concern about the 'burdens on citizens' imposed by their interactions with government is now moving quickly up the policy agenda in the UK, and a few attempts to measure claimants' compliance costs were initiated whilst this scoping study was being undertaken. Within the European Union, member states have also begun to exchange information and experiences about reducing burdens on citizens more generally. The Netherlands has developed both its policies and its measurement methods further than many other countries. This is a scoping study and does not set out to measure the costs of compliance incurred by benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> claimants. Instead, it explores the nature of the costs of compliance for claimants of benefits and tax credits; assesses whether such costs can be measured and, if so, to what extent; and discusses whether impact assessments of policy changes could include such measurements. We also hope that this report will act as a catalyst for the further development of these techniques to improve policy assessment in the benefits and <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> systems. ...|$|R

However, most of these findings are based on estimated R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> rather than actual R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> In contrast, I use actual R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> reported by the firms in their 10 -Ks. I examine three {{issues related to the}} use of R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> First, I investigate whether the likelihood of using the credit varies with characteristics related to research ability and tax advantages of firms. Next, I analyze whether the use of R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> increases real R&D spending. Finally, I explore if the <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> impacts R&D performance, by examining innovation quality, future pre-tax profitability, and return volatility. The results are consistent with my hypotheses.
