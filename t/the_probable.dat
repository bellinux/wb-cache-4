5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} the pilots {{who had previously}} spoken {{to the media and}} been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between the accident and the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error being involved in the crash were speculation, although this conclusion was later established to be <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> cause of the accident.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} finding <b>the</b> most <b>probable</b> string for a {{distribution}} {{generated by a}} weighted finite automaton or a probabilistic grammar is related {{to a number of}} important questions: computing the distance between two distributions or finding the best translation (<b>the</b> most <b>probable</b> one) given a probabilistic finite state transducer. The problem is undecidable with general weights and is N P-hard if the automaton is probabilistic. We give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm which computes <b>the</b> most <b>probable</b> string in time polynomial in the inverse of the probability of <b>the</b> most <b>probable</b> string itself, both for probabilistic finite automata and probabilistic context-free grammars. We also give a randomised algorithm solving the same problem. ...|$|R

5|$|Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, {{commander-in-chief}} of RAF Coastal Command agreed {{this was}} <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> route.

Unfortunately, the Air Ministry and the three RAF commands, RAF Coastal Command, RAF Bomber Command and RAF Fighter Command, believed the Germans would use the darkness for the longest and most dangerous {{part of the journey}} through the straits and would leave in daylight. The far from adequate forces at their disposal, they believed, would be best used at night. Most of RAF Bomber Command was ordered to stand down accordingly. Such an order made it totally unprepared to strike in daylight hours on 12 February.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 7 September 1191, as Richard's forces {{began moving}} out of camp enemy scouts were visible in all directions, hinting that Saladin's whole army lay hidden in the woodland.

5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office.

5|$|In {{the trials}} {{match for the}} 1910 Five Nations Championship, Guillemin was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Possibles against <b>the</b> <b>Probables.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Probables</b> won a close game 9–6, and Guillemin was selected again to play for France. The fourth match between England and France was held at Leicester on 30 January 1909. The English dominated from the start but the French put up a good fight, as both the English and French press reported. The French forwards were compared in their style of play with those of Ireland, with good footballing skills. Although the English won a fourth successive victory, 22–0, it seemed as though the French game was beginning to develop.|$|R

5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were {{sizeable}} Preclassic {{cities that}} survived into the Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> enthronement {{of a king}} of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this there is {{a gap in the}} hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events of this period may be either {{due to the fact that}} the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or perhaps that the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E
5|$|In its {{southern}} range Tyrannosaurus lived alongside the titanosaur Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Torosaurus, Bravoceratops and Ojoceratops, hadrosaurs {{which consisted of}} a species of Edmontosaurus, Kritosaurus and a possible species of Gryposaurus, the nodosaur Glyptodontopelta, the oviraptorid Ojoraptosaurus, possible species of the theropods Troodon and Richardoestesia, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. The region {{is thought to have}} been dominated by semi-arid inland plains, following <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> retreat of the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell.|$|E
5000|$|His {{performances}} {{earned him}} {{an invitation to}} play for the Possibles against <b>the</b> <b>Probables</b> in March 1936 in a trial match for selection for the England national team. The quality of <b>the</b> <b>Probables</b> defence, with Alf Young outstanding, meant Cheetham had little chance to shine - The Times correspondent reported that [...] "Cheetham did not receive a pass for nearly half an hour", but [...] "considering the brilliance of Young, the play of Cheetham could hardly be considered unsatisfactory". Though his next two seasons were less productive, in 1938-39 he scored 22 league goals from the 26 games before he left the club on 7 February 1939 to join First Division club Brentford for a fee of £5,000.|$|R

5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} {{explored}} {{on several occasions}} by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.|$|E
5|$|Lessons {{depicts a}} mother {{teaching}} her son. Presumably, {{many of the}} events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed <b>the</b> <b>probable</b> publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for Children of two to three (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part I (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part II (1778); and Lessons for Children of three to four (1779). After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.|$|E
500|$|For {{the trials}} match between <b>the</b> <b>Probables</b> and <b>the</b> Possibles on 18 December 1910 at Colombes, Guillemin played for <b>the</b> <b>Probables</b> and was then {{selected}} for France. G. Neumeyer writing in la Culture physique, considered that the selectors {{had made the}} right choice of XV, with the exception of Guillemin. In his opinion, it was deplorable that he should be selected, noting his [...] "remarkable brutality", proof of which he demonstrated in the trials match, and that he ought to be thrown out of the national team for all time. Reichel in Le Figaro agreed that Guillemin's play was more violent than effective and would have preferred the selection of Berneron, who did [...] "great work" [...] for the Possibles.|$|R
