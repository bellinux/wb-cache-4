500|$|Brown {{praised the}} {{addition}} of Fink as Lauren to New Directions, and declared, [...] "I hope she's on the team for keeps", while Poniewozik was pleased that [...] "the episode used Lauren for comedy without simply making her the butt of jokes". Brown also wrote, [...] "Kurt's arc was subtler <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> thereby about 50 times more interesting. I [...] am impressed that Glee handling his acclimation to Dalton so truthfully." [...] Canning was similarly impressed, and called Kurt at Dalton [...] "the most solid story" [...] of the episode. There was little approval among reviewers for the [...] "canary in a cage" [...] metaphor in the scene between Kurt and Blaine {{at the end of}} the episode, with Kurt the [...] "canary" [...] in his new Dalton cage; Hankinson characterized it as [...] "super ham-fisted", and others were nearly as harsh.|$|E
500|$|Burton, who {{finished}} second, {{was happy with}} his performance, [...] " [...] Todd Berrier has come in and done a great job, the team’s done a great job. We had one hiccough early on pit road {{but the rest of}} them we picked out our spots every single time, and that’s what it takes; it takes a team effort." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was {{no doubt in my mind}} they were going to come <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that he is the best, that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wall Street Journals Gwen Orel {{wrote that}} [...] "maybe it’s the curse wearing off, but {{the use of}} {{parallel}} worlds and stories is better and better, sometimes even gesture to gesture.

He felt that it was [...] "the strongest episode of the series since Rumpelstiltskin’s first" [...] flashback in [...] "Desperate Souls" [...] because it did a better job handling the fairytale storyline. However, Sava faulted it for containing predictable elements, having many of the characters acting stupidly, and for being [...] "painfully obvious while trying to be clever, aiming for poignancy but getting laughs instead." [...] Sava praised Griffiths' performance for [...] "min her wooden dialogue for some real emotional weight." ...|$|E

500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger last week, it was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was going on here, {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone wants to play in the final, I'm no different.

I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

He stated that it {{is in the interest of}} Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war". Later in the interview when Gilmore was asked if he believed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was credible, he stated, [...] "No, I don’t think he is particularly credible". On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>and</b> continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee.

She praised the interaction between Megan and Lacey calling their conversation [...] "cute", adding [...] "It's nice to watch Megan make extra time to spend with her daughter".

Orlando added that she did not [...] "see coming" [...] Martin's reaction to the apology; he shot Alan, stating [...] "I could understand the sentiment". She praised the interaction between Megan and Peter, highlighting their conversation over Peter's girlfriend. Orlando said that she could not understand Megan's facial expressions to Peter's girlfriend, whether it was one of jealousy or tease. She said, [...] "Megan was certainly giving Peter a lot of ribbing about his new girlfriend. Was Megan just having fun with him or did it bother her a little? I couldn't quite tell". She finished in saying, [...] "A [...] "Hunting Party" [...] led to a tragic death and a merry go round of suspects on Body of Proof this week".|$|E
500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years."
