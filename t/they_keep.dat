5|$|Potty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary {{environment}} (such as keeping {{ground beef}} {{in an old}} boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. Patchy then tells the viewers to watch {{the rest of the}} SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for Patchy to get in his office.|$|E
5|$|The group became {{lost and}} confused. After {{two more days}} without food, Patrick Dolan {{proposed}} {{that one of them}} should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E

5|$|Ducks are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, {{eyes on the}} side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. They {{come to the}} ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E

He {{is at odds}} with the heroes of the original Golden Sun, led by the young Venus Adept warrior Isaac, who pursue him across the World, Weyard under the belief that Alchemy would potentially destroy Weyard if unleashed. One of Saturos' original companions, a powerful and enigmatic Mercury Adept named Alex, allies himself with a second pair of powerful and imposing Mars Adept warriors, Karst and Agatio. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> the pressure on Felix to ensure he proceeds with his quest as he is supposed to.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic {{community}} in Afghanistan is mainly made of foreigners, especially aid workers, and no Afghans {{are known to}} be currently part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> it secret when they return. Two Christian groups, Church World Service and Norwegian Church Aid, were accused of proselytizing while doing aid work in Afghanistan, which they denied, and 1,000 Afghans protested in Mazar-i-Sharif and burned the pope in effigy. Despite this, the community has grown from only a few sisters to a full Sunday Mass of around 100. Church attendance dipped in 2012 due to security concerns and less emphasis on religion among the foreigners in Afghanistan in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E
5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find Snow White {{seemingly}} dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her {{out of sight in}} the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> further from the shore.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
5|$|Ripley 8 (Sigourney Weaver), {{also known}} as Number 8, is a human-Alien hybrid cloned from the DNA of Ellen Ripley and the {{embryonic}} Alien Queen recovered from Ripley's blood samples taken from Fury 161. The DNA's integrity has been compromised {{by the process of}} infestation and the human and Alien DNA in Number 8 is mixed, creating a humanoid organism with Alien traits such as an empathic link {{with the rest of the}} hive, acidic blood, enhanced strength and reflexes and genetic memories. After United Systems Military researchers extract the Alien Queen from Number 8 on the ship USM Auriga in the year 2381, <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> her alive and confined and give her a rudimentary education. When the Aliens breach their containment, Number 8 joins the crew of the mercenary vessel Betty to attempt an escape; she is captured by the Aliens, who bring her to their nest. Number 8's Alien Queen gives birth to a Newborn, a hybrid which identifies Number 8 as its mother after it kills the Alien Queen. Number 8 escapes from the Auriga on the Betty and again encounters the Newborn, which she jettisons into space. After the Betty lands on Earth, Number 8 looks around with the other survivors and wonders about their uncertain future.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E

5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E
5|$|Their goal in Laos {{seemingly}} achieved, President Thieu and General Lãm {{ordered a}} withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March {{that was to}} continue {{through the rest of}} the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy these force before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.|$|E
5|$|When {{they return}} to Tokyo, thirty years have passed, and the world lies in ruins. Both demons and humans live in Tokyo, and two warring groups have formed: the Order of Messiah, who is {{building}} a cathedral and wants {{to bring about the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom, and the Ring of Gaea, who intends to summon Lucifer and wants freedom. While exploring the city, the Hero meets the Heroine, who has been reincarnated, and she joins the group. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> traversing the ruins, until the Chaos Hero decides to leave, and fuses himself with a demon to gain power; they move on without him, until the Law Hero's soul gets taken by an attacking demon. The Chaos Hero joins the Ring of Gaea, while the Law Hero's soul gets reincarnated as the new Messiah. Both try to get the Hero to join their respective side; players can choose to support either, or to reject both. Regardless of what they choose, the Order of Messiah finishes building their cathedral, and a great flood appears, drowning people who were not inside the cathedral at the time. Survivors set up camps inside the cathedral; the Order of Messiah takes control of the top floors, while the Ring of Gaea occupies the basement floors.|$|E
