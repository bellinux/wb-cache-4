5|$|Biggs {{played for}} several club teams {{throughout}} his career, including England's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh.

At county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother, and later turned out for Somerset. During the 1893/94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff, {{and in the same}} season he led Cardiff against the invitational team <b>the</b> <b>Barbarians,</b> not only winning the game but also scoring two tries and kicking a successful conversion. The same season as he faced <b>the</b> <b>Barbarians</b> with Cardiff, Biggs was invited to join the tourists; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team. The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath, captaining the senior team during the 1899–1900 season.|$|E

5|$|Just over a {{month after}} playing for Wales against New Zealand, John faced the {{tourists}} again, this time {{as part of an}} East Wales team, made up of players from Cardiff, London Welsh and Bridgend. The New Zealand 'All Blacks' were under pressure throughout the match, with John kicking from deep and away from the opposing forwards, allowing his team to make rushes on the 'All Black' defence. After 22minutes East Wales took the lead when a missed drop goal attempt from John was collected by Cardiff wing Frank Wilson for a try. A defensive lapse from the East Wales team allowed an equalising try, but with the score at 3–3, East Wales dominated the last ten minutes of the match. With the last kick of the match, John had space for one final dropped goal, but his kick sailed inches outside the post. The New Zealanders were glad to escape with the draw and finished the tour without losing a single match. Three days after turning out for East Wales, John and Edwards were paired to face the same New Zealand team, this time played at Twickenham for invitational touring side <b>the</b> <b>Barbarians.</b> The half time result of 3–3 flattered <b>the</b> <b>Barbarians,</b> who were out-played in the forward positions, but the team took the lead early in the second half when a perfect diagonal kick to the corner by John resulted in a try by England's Bob Lloyd. <b>The</b> <b>Barbarians</b> defended strongly for twenty minutes, but lost to two very late tries.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd century saw the Danube river {{become the}} {{principal}} artery of trade, eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes.

5|$|This kind {{of combat}} was {{consistent}} with the aim of minimising casualties and its efficacy is illustrated by the Battle of Strasbourg.
