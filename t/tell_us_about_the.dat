500|$|Writers for Variety, the Hollywood Reporter and Sight & Sound all {{emphasized}} the film's final scene. Scheck (Hollywood Reporter) wrote that [...] "Miike lulls the audience {{into a state}} of complacency with a studied, slow-moving, lightly comic first half before delivering a gruesome final section that makes Stephen King's Misery look wholesome"; the ending was [...] "all the more shocking for the clinical way in which it is presented". Eisner (Variety) stated that it is only at the ending of the film that Audition [...] "breaks out of creepfest ghetto". [...] In his essay on themes in Audition, Robin Wood stated that most of Miike's films are disturbing for [...] "what they have to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state of contemporary civilization; they are not in the least disturbing in themselves, operating on some fantasy level of annihilation, with 'comic-book' violence". In comparison, he stated that Audition is [...] "authentically disturbing, and infinitely more horrifying: the first time I watched it – on DVD, at home, after warnings I had received – I was repeatedly tempted, through the last half hour, to turn it off". Wood compared the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, stating that the film was [...] "almost as unwatchable as the news reels – of Auschwitz, of the innocent victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam, victims of Nazi or American dehumanization".|$|E
500|$|Jerry Coyne, {{writing in}} Nature, {{described}} {{the book as}} for the interested lay reader, and called it [...] "a paean to recent advances in developmental genetics, and what they may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> evolutionary process." [...] For him, the centrepiece was [...] "the unexpected discovery that the genes that control the body plans of all bilateral animals, including worms, insects, frogs and humans, are largely identical. These are the 'homeobox' (Hox) genes". He called Carroll {{a leader in the}} field and an [...] "adept communicator", but admits to [...] "feeling uncomfortable" [...] when Carroll sets out his personal vision of the field [...] "without admitting that large parts of that vision remain controversial." [...] Coyne pointed out that the idea that the [...] "'regulatory gene' is the locus of evolution" [...] dates back to Roy Britten and colleagues around 1970, but was still weakly supported by observation or experiment. He granted that chimps and humans are almost 99% identical at DNA level, but points out that [...] "humans and chimps have different amino-acid sequences in at least 55% of their proteins, a figure that rises to 95% for humans and mice. Thus we can't exclude protein-sequence evolution as an important reason why we lack whiskers and tails." [...] He also noted that nearly half of human protein-coding genes do not have homologues in fruit flies, so one could argue the opposite of Carroll's thesis and claim that [...] "evolution of form is very much a matter of teaching old genes to make new genes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nuzi was {{a provincial}} town of Arrapha. It was {{administered}} by a governor (šaknu) from the palace. The palace, {{situated in the}} center of the mound, had many rooms arranged around a central courtyard.

The walls were painted, as was seen in fragments unearthed in the ruins of the building.

Justice was rendered by these officers, but also by judges (dayānu) installed in the districts. Free subjects of the state were liable to a charge, the Ilku, which seems to consist of chores (military service, work for various government account, including its land). When a person sold land to another but remained to exploit it, they kept the burden of drudgery: the responsibility weighed on the operator and not the owner.|$|E
