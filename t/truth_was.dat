5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps.

50|$|Fitch's {{paradox of}} knowability {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} puzzles of epistemic logic. It provides a challenge to the knowability thesis, which states that every <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> in principle, knowable. The paradox is that this assumption implies the omniscience principle, which asserts that every <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> known. Essentially, Fitch's paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> unknowable. So if all <b>truths</b> <b>were</b> knowable, it would follow that all <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> in fact known.|$|R

The parents were worried that teachers were not pointing out supposed inaccuracies in the film and were not explaining differing viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, new {{evidence}} concerning {{the murder of}} Luke Doggett came to light. Doggett sought Follmer's assistance because he had worked against organized crime in New York City before coming to Washington. Reyes, however, recalled seeing Follmer accept a bribe from a mobster. Although he tried to play the event off as him paying an informant (at which he nearly succeeded), the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> as Reyes suspected: Follmer was crooked. Once the truth of Luke's fate was revealed, Follmer killed the mobster who had nevertheless threatened blackmail concerning Follmer's bribe acceptance. Follmer's future at the FBI was left unresolved, although he most likely faced criminal charges for his actions.|$|E
5|$|In North America, South Park: The Stick of <b>Truth</b> <b>was</b> {{the third}} best-selling {{physical}} game of March 2014, behind Titanfall and Infamous Second Son. Digital distribution accounted for 25% of the game's sales, making it Ubisoft's most downloaded title at the time. It was the ninth best-selling downloadable game of 2014 on the PlayStation Store. In May 2015, Ubisoft {{confirmed that the}} game had sold 1.6 million copies as of March 2015. As of February 2016, Ubisoft had shipped 5 million copies of the game.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> an eternal one. This problem charges {{us with the}} duty of {{exploring}} the <b>truth.</b> It <b>was</b> discussed by classic (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas) and modem philosophers (Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Kussel etc.). There are many theories about question of truth but two points of view <b>are</b> dominât: subjective (<b>truth</b> <b>is</b> the intellect, reason) and objective (<b>truth</b> <b>is</b> in objective reality).

5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> that Montagu had already lost the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E
5|$|The Stick of <b>Truth</b> <b>was</b> {{subject to}} {{censorship}} {{in some regions}} because of its content, which includes abortions and Nazi imagery; Parker and Stone replaced the scenes with detailed explanations of what occurs in each scene. The game was released to positive reviews, which praised the comedic script, visual style, and faithfulness to the source material. It received criticism {{for a lack of}} challenging combat and technical issues that slowed or impeded progress. A sequel, , was released on October 17, 2017. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of The Stick of Truth were released with The Fractured but Whole.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{resurgence}} in popularity since {{the success of}} Don't Believe The <b>Truth</b> <b>was</b> highlighted in February 2008 when, in a poll to find the fifty greatest British albums of {{the last fifty years}} conducted by Q magazine and HMV, two Oasis albums were voted first and second (Definitely Maybe and (What's The Story) Morning Glory? respectively). Two other albums by the band appeared in the list – Don't Believe The Truth came in at number fourteen, and the album that has previously been heavily criticised by some of the media, Be Here Now, made the list at No.22.|$|E

40|$|The Church–Fitch argument, or 'paradox' of knowability, {{apparently}} shows that, if all <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> knowable, {{then all}} <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> known. As some <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> unknown, anti-realists who hold that <b>truths</b> must <b>be</b> knowable {{have been at}} pains to block the argument. Here, I consider two such approaches: denying that knowledge distributes over conjunction, and moving to a typed logic. I argue that neither approach works. I first show that a Church–Fitch argument can be run with an assumption weaker than distribution of knowledge over conjunction. I then argue that a modified Church–Fitch argument can be constructed in a typed logic. So neither approach will help those who hold that all <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> knowable. 12 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Whatever the <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> by 5 July 1277 Przemysł II was in Lubin. The {{release of}} Henryk IV Probus took place some days later, on 22 July, after the {{surrender}} to Bolesław II of 1/5 of his Duchy, {{with the town}} of Środa Śląska at the head. Bolesław the Pious was against the participation of his nephew in this conflict; he not only refused to support him militarily but also invaded {{the borders of the}} Duchy of Wrocław, trying to assert financial claims. Moreover, at this point, he gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Henry V the Fat.|$|E
5|$|A Different Kind of <b>Truth</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} at Henson Recording Studios and Eddie Van Halen's own 5150 Studios and produced by John Shanks. Seven of the album's thirteen songs are musically re-worked and lyrically re-written songs {{that had been}} demoed in the late-1970s/early 1980s, but never officially released. The album received positive reviews upon release, with several writers referring {{to it as a}} return to form, and multiple publications ranked it {{as one of the best}} albums of 2012. It was also a commercial success, debuting in the top ten on numerous record charts. It debuted at No.2 on the Billboard 200 and, by the end of 2012, had sold in excess of 411,000 copies in the United States alone. The album was promoted with an arena tour.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E

5|$|Divine command theory {{features}} in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Christianity, {{as well as being}} a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|In Act III, {{the player}} meets the Founder of the Academy, and Safiya realizes that she, Lienna, and Nefris are all {{splinters}} of the Founder’s soul, {{and that the}} Founder was once Akachi’s lover. The Founder explains that, while Lienna and Nefris understood their identities, the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> hidden from Safiya for her own safety. The Founder also admits that she {{is responsible for the}} player's plight – she wanted to use the player to end the spirit-eater curse (and Akachi’s suffering, as well). She returns the silver sword of Gith to the player, which allows him to open the Betrayer's Gate and travel to the realm of the dead. There the player finds the City of Judgment, ruled by the current God of the Dead, Kelemvor Lyonsbane. As the player arrives, an army is assembling outside the walls, led by Akachi’s captains from his First Crusade – Zoab, a fallen solar, Rammaq, a demilich, and Sey'ryu, a blue dragon. The captains recognize the player as Akachi’s heir, and the player must decide whether to lead their crusade against the City of Judgment or to oppose them.|$|E
5|$|South Park: The Stick of <b>Truth</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in North America on March 4, 2014, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It {{was released on}} March 6 in Australia and on March 7 in Europe. The game had been scheduled for release on March 5, 2013, but this was postponed two months by then-publisher THQ. After THQ filed for bankruptcy in January 2013, Ubisoft purchased the rights to publish the game and did not specify a release date. By May 2013, Ubisoft had confirmed {{that it would be}} released that year after it was omitted from their upcoming games release schedule. On September 26, 2013, Ubisoft announced that The Stick of Truth would be {{released in}} December 2013, but in October 2013 the game's release was again postponed until March 2014. The game was scheduled for release on March 6, 2014 in Germany and Austria, but it was delayed after the localized version of the game was found to contain Nazi references. A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version of the game was scheduled for release on December 6, 2016.|$|E

40|$|Frege {{never wrote}} very much {{specifically}} about {{his views on}} truth. Further, what he did have {{to say on the}} subject is perhaps a bit elusive, and not altogether clear. However, if one puts together the salient passages from some of his later papers such as “Logic”, “Thought ” and even a bit from “On Sinn and Bedeutung ” a picture of Frege’s views on truth begins to emerge. 1 Common to these texts is the view that the word “true ” is ultimately indefinable. In studying passages from the aforementioned texts, it also seems clear that Frege believed that there was a sound argument to this conclusion. What is not clear, however, is exactly what the central argument against the definability of <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> and whether the claim that <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> indefinable is Frege’s final conclusion, or if it is a subsidiary conclusion in a larger argument. Some philosophers have claimed that Frege’s final conclusion <b>is</b> that <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> not a property. 2 Others argue that Frege held the view that <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> not a property independently of his views on definability, and that Frege’s view that <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> not a property contributes to the overall claim that <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> indefinable. 3 I am inclined to agree with the latter. In fact, I believe that in addition to the negative claim that <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> not a property,...|$|R
40|$|The weak {{deflationist}} about <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> {{committed to}} two theses: one conceptual, the other ontological.

In this paper, I focus on weak deflationism’s ontological thesis, arguing that it generates an instability in its view of truth: the view threatens to collapse into either that of strong deflationism (i. e., <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> not a property) or that of some form of inflationism (i. e., <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> a substantial property).
