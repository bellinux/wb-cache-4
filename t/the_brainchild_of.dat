5|$|The 1880s {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of the Asian oil trade. The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via the Suez Canal was <b>the</b> <b>brainchild</b> <b>of</b> two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the Suez Canal Company as being too risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.|$|E

5|$|Primarily <b>the</b> <b>brainchild</b> <b>of</b> General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed {{to provoke a}} popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, {{opened in}} 1963, was <b>the</b> <b>brainchild</b> <b>of</b> Sir Tyrone Guthrie, {{who wanted to}} found a {{regional}} theater without the commercial constraints of Broadway. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and {{made it difficult to}} stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the New York Times, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.|$|E

5|$|The Jakarta Post was <b>the</b> <b>brainchild</b> <b>of</b> Information Minister Ali Murtopo and {{politician}} Jusuf Wanandi. Murtopo and Wanandi {{were disappointed}} at the perceived bias against Indonesia in foreign news sources. At the time, {{there were two}} English-language dailies, The Indonesia Times and The Indonesian Observer. However, due to negative public perception regarding the existing papers they decided {{to create a new}} one. In order to ensure credibility, the two agreed to convince a group of competing newspapers (the Golkar-backed Suara Karya, the Catholic-owned Kompas, the Protestant-owned Sinar Harapan, and the weekly Tempo) to back the nascent paper. It was hoped to become a quality English-language paper, similar to The Straits Times in Singapore, the Bangkok Post in Thailand, and the New Straits Times in Malaysia.|$|E

The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was <b>the</b> <b>brainchild</b> <b>of</b> Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E

The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E

The corporation was established specifically {{for the purposes of}} the bid, and came to their bidding figure by estimating that the likely competition would bid at $130 million; their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent, and added on $127,000 to avoid a suspiciously round number. TETCO believed it could afford to make this offer because it intended to reuse the electric motors in the oil pumping mechanisms for moving the natural gas; it also believed that the price of gas would rise considerably in the post-war markets.|$|E

40|$|Nearly {{every country}} in the world has its own history of beekeeping. From the Swiss leaf hive to the Kenyan top bar hive, the number of ways to keep bees is {{practically}} limitless. Such diversity allows for a unique opportunity in the field of development.

This was <b>the</b> <b>brainchild</b> <b>of</b> Father Thomas Moloney, who bought the current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the back so that a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926.

5|$|The next era of Kīlauea's history {{began with}} the {{establishment}} of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912.

After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.|$|E
