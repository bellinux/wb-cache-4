5|$|Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) was a {{business}} route running in Niles. The western terminus was {{at the corner of}} West Chicago Road and US12 (Pulaski Highway) east of the US12/US31 interchange. From there, the business loop followed Chicago Road northeasterly through residential areas {{on the west side of}} town. Bus. US12 turned north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street, crossing the St. Joseph River. The loop intersected the southern end of M-139 at Front Street one block east of the river in downtown Niles. Four blocks further east, Bus. US12 met M-51. The two highways merged along Main Street and then turned south along 11th Street at an intersection that also marks the western terminus of Bus. M-60 (Oak Street). Bus. US12/M-51 continued south along 11th Street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of US12 (Pulaski Highway) and M-51 (South 11th Street) where the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Star Trek, he was {{nominated}} for Hugo Awards for two television movies, Genesis II and The Questor Tapes. In addition to awards, Roddenberry also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame following a campaign by the fan clubs of Star Trek, which sought to have each fan donate a dollar towards the overall $3500 cost of upkeep. Following these donations, the Committee {{in charge of the}} Walk of Fame voted Roddenberry in. The star was unveiled on September 4, 1985, at the 6600 block, near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas. The induction ceremony was attended by all of the main cast of Star Trek, as well as Roger C. Carmel, who portrayed Harry Mudd in The Original Series. Following Roddenberry's death in 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Memorial Award by the National Space Society and The George Pal Memorial Award at the Saturn Awards. He was also awarded the Exceptional Public Service Medal by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials {{in the mid-1980s}} to {{truncate}} US10 to Bay City. The request was approved on October 11, 1985, and the signage was changed the next year. After the change, the Lodge Freeway was redesignated M-10. The non-freeway Northwestern Highway, until then designated M-4, was also renumbered as M-10. The southernmost portion of the Lodge Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of BS I-375 from I-75 south. By the next year however, {{the southern end of}} M-10 was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of Jefferson and Randolph, placing all of the Lodge Freeway as part of M-10.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dealt with}} the Strand branch: it {{confirmed}} {{the layout of the}} junction between the branch and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend the branch south under the River Thames to the London and South Western Railway's (L's) terminus at Waterloo station. The extension included moving Strand station <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel from there to the BS's Waterloo station which would be provided with additional lifts to serve the GNP's platforms. The branch was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station. The junction layout and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo. The bill received royal assent on 4 August 1905 as the Great Northern Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1905.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game will begin in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{began with a}} stare down. Luger gained the early {{advantage}} and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked {{him out of the}} ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory.|$|E
5|$|Just over a {{month after}} playing for Wales against New Zealand, John faced the {{tourists}} again, this time {{as part of an}} East Wales team, made up of players from Cardiff, London Welsh and Bridgend. The New Zealand 'All Blacks' were under pressure throughout the match, with John kicking from deep and away from the opposing forwards, allowing his team to make rushes on the 'All Black' defence. After 22minutes East Wales took the lead when a missed drop goal attempt from John was collected by Cardiff wing Frank Wilson for a try. A defensive lapse from the East Wales team allowed an equalising try, but with the score at 3–3, East Wales dominated the last ten minutes of the match. With the last kick of the match, John had space for one final dropped goal, but his kick sailed inches outside the post. The New Zealanders were glad to escape with the draw and finished the tour without losing a single match. Three days after turning out for East Wales, John and Edwards were paired to face the same New Zealand team, this time played at Twickenham for invitational touring side the Barbarians. The half time result of 3–3 flattered the Barbarians, who were out-played in the forward positions, but the team took the lead early in the second half when a perfect diagonal kick <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> by John resulted in a try by England's Bob Lloyd. The Barbarians defended strongly for twenty minutes, but lost to two very late tries.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E

5|$|On 27 July 2007, Burnley {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a £20 million redevelopment of Turf Moor. The plans also included {{the creation of a}} youth academy at the club's training facility at Gawthorpe Hall in nearby Padiham. The plans were detailed in six phases. In the first phase it was planned to move the changing rooms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> between the James Hargreaves Stand and the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. The second phase included the demolition of the Cricket Field Stand, a new stand to be built at that end of the ground that would incorporate a hotel, a restaurant and a newly constructed cricket pavilion, and would be able to accommodate 2,500 fans. The redevelopments also included the construction of a multi-storey car park adjacent to the stadium. Other planned improvements include a new club superstore and other retail outlets, and new business offices {{on the site of the}} current club shop. Revealed in the fifth phase was a transformation of the Bob Lord Stand, which will eventually house a multi-screen cinema. The development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was later revealed by Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher, taking the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor to 28,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, {{but while}} {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked {{down by a}} police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, {{and the loss of}} her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E
