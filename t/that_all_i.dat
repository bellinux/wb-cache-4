500|$|By 1900 Olga, age 18, {{was being}} escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, {{a member of}} the Russian branch of the House of Oldenburg. He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for {{literature}} and gambling. Peter asked for Olga's hand in marriage the following year, a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise: [...] "I was so taken aback <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could say was 'thank you'," [...] she later explained.|$|E
500|$|Ice-T co-wrote the band's {{music and}} lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C, and {{took on the}} duties of lead vocalist. Ice-T states that [...] "I knew I couldn't sing, but then I thought, 'Who can sing in rock 'n' roll?'" [...] Aside from Ice-T and Ernie C, the {{original}} line-up consisted of Mooseman on bass, Beatmaster V on drums and D-Roc on rhythm guitar. According to Ice-T, [...] "We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A., I'd watch the news, and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. 'Is <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> am,' I thought, 'a body count?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
5000|$|His most {{successful}} recording period was between 1970 and 1980, {{though he has}} since recorded ten studio albums up to 2015. Speaking in 2009 he said, [...] "I write pop songs. End of story. <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do. <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> want to do. And <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> continue to want to do.

2500|$|Beckett {{refrained from}} elaborating on the {{characters}} beyond {{what he had}} written in the play. He once recalled that when Sir Ralph Richardson [...] "wanted the low-down on Pozzo, his home address and curriculum vitae, and seemed to make the forthcoming of this and similar information the condition of his condescending to illustrate the part of Vladimir ... I told him <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> knew about Pozzo was in the text, that if I had known more I would have {{put it in the}} text, and that was true also of the other characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{said that}} he had {{considered}} quitting international football after the reactions to the incident, but was persuaded not to by friends and family. He criticised the French Football Federation (FFF) for their lack of support {{in the aftermath of the}} controversy. He regretted the immediate celebration of the goal but put it down to the emotion of the moment, and reflected that not informing the referee had been a mistake. On the issue of lasting impact of the incident, Henry said [...] "I don't think <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have achieved in my career up until now will be spoiled by this".|$|E

[...] He quit the GOI's copyrights panels in February 2010 after facing sharp differences with other members. During the promotion of 3 Idiots, he journeyed to diverse parts of India, mostly to small towns, noting that [...] "film makers from Mumbai don't understand small-town India." [...] This experience of reaching out to [...] "regional India" [...] was extended in his debut TV show, Satyamev Jayate. On 16 July 2012, Khan met {{the prime minister and}} the minister for social justice and empowerment and discussed the plight of manual scavengers and sought eradication of manual scavenging in the country.|$|E
2500|$|In news {{interview}}s, Richter {{talked about}} her love of cooking, sewing and raising children, but she also spoke to her yearning to create art. In an April 1960 interview with Jean Reeves in the Buffalo Evening News titled [...] "Amid Houseful of Distractions, Woman Artist Paints on," [...] Richter said, [...] "All my life I {{wanted to be an}} artist. But I fought against it. I'd stand in front of Dad's paintings and I'd think Why try? But they inspired me, too. But it was a lost cause, and I decided <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> really wanted to do was paint, so why fight it? Painting isn't something I took up as a means of escape from dishes and diapers. The urge to paint was there before any frustration with housework. A serious artist paints because he has to; it's an inborn drive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E

The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I thought you did a really phenomenal job, I really did. I can't fault <b>that,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can fault is myself for not turning around. I am looking for a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and you get back on the horse and you carry on." ...|$|E
