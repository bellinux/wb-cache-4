It is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> retrofitted by February 2015. The estimated cost is R$20million. One of the largest changes will be the construction of large balconies and the installation of scoreboards behind the goals where the temporary seating installed for the FIFA World Cup stands.|$|E

The San Sabá mission was the only Spanish mission in Texas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed by Indians, and it was never rebuilt. Although the Indian force had 2000members, they chose not to attack the fort.|$|E

Stolpe tried to find it, but noted in 1869 that the landowner knew of the runestone, but that the latter had reported it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> covered in soil, and in 1951, a runologist tried to locate the runestone but failed.|$|E

5|$|The first {{member of}} the genus to be {{described}} was the red-billed chough, named as Upupa pyrrhocorax by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758. His genus Upupa contained species that had a long curved bill and a short blunt tongue. These included the northern bald ibis and the hoopoe, birds now known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> unrelated to the choughs.|$|E

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, {{following}} the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, 244 vehicles of the Czechoslovak Army were {{seized by the}} Germans where they were known as the L.T.M.35 until January 1940. In German service, they were used as substitutes for the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank. They {{were assigned to the}} Panzer Battalion (Panzerabteilung) 65 (39) of the 1st Light (leichte) Division and the independent Panzer-Regiment 11 (81) where they participated in the Invasion of Poland. 77 of these were lost during the campaign, mostly due to mechanical breakdowns, but only 7 of these were irreparable. From 1940 on, there had not been any spare parts available and tanks had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt to remain operational.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern.|$|E
