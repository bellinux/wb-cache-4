25|$|While Akbar Khan {{had been}} absent {{conducting}} {{the siege of}} Jalalabad, Shah Shuja had restored his authority around Kabul. After <b>temporising</b> for several weeks and secretly asking for British help from India, he reluctantly emerged from the Bala Hissar {{at the end of}} March to join the jihad proclaimed by Akbar Khan. He was assassinated by adherents of Nawab Zaman Khan, an influential chieftain who resented the favour shown by Shah Shuja to his rival Naib Aminullah Khan. One of the assassins was Shah Shuja's godson, Shuja' al-Daula. Shah Shuja's son Futteh Jung proclaimed himself his father's successor, but had even less support than his father.|$|E
60|$|Lord Romsey hesitated. His natural {{propensity}} for <b>temporising</b> asserted itself and his finger left the bell. The other continued.|$|E

6000|$|... 7. The reader may judge, {{whether some}} distant and obscure allusion to [...] the {{trimming}} politics of Halifax, {{to whom the}} Duke of York, our [...] author's patron, was hostile, may not be here insinuated. During [...] the stormy session of his two last parliaments, Charles was much [...] guided by his <b>temporising</b> and camelion-like policy.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} of electoral scandals at Liverpool, which naturally excited lively {{interest in a}} family with local ties so strong, came up in various forms during the session, and {{on one of these}} occasions (July 4) Mr. Gladstone spoke upon it, 'for twenty minutes or more, anything but satisfactorily to myself.' Nor can the speech now be called satisfactory by any one else, except for the enunciation of the sound maxim that the giver of a bribe deserves punishment quite as richly as the receiver. Four days later he spoke for something less than half an hour on the third reading of the Irish Church Reform bill. 'I was heard,' he tells his father, 'with kindness and indulgence, but it is, after all, uphill work to address an assembly so much estranged in feeling from one's self.' Peel's speech was described as <b>temporising,</b> and the deliverance of his young lieutenant was <b>temporising</b> too, though firm on the necessary principle, as he called it, of which the world was before long to hear so much from him, that the nation should be taxed for the support of a national church.|$|E
60|$|I felt, of course, at the time, {{that this}} <b>temporising</b> {{on my part}} would {{probably}} end in bringing Marian here {{in a state of}} virtuous indignation, banging doors. But then, the other course of proceeding might end in bringing Sir Percival here in a state of virtuous indignation, banging doors also, and of the two indignations and bangings I preferred Marian's, because I was used to her. Accordingly I despatched the letter by return of post. It gained me time, at all events--and, oh dear me! what a point that was to begin with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why ought he to know?" [...] asked Imogene, doubtless {{with that}} impulse to <b>temporise</b> which is natural {{to the human}} soul in {{questions}} of right and interest. She sank into the chair beside which she had been standing.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>temporised.</b> 'Strangers {{see these}} things most,' I said, airing the stock platitudes. 'It may be superficial. And, of course, {{one knows that}} {{profound}} differences of intellect and moral feeling often occur {{within the limits of}} a single family.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} if you are obdurate with him, he and your brother may hurry you by force into this union. But if you <b>temporise</b> with half-promises, with {{suggestions}} that before Christmas you may grow reconciled to his wishes, he will be patient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{do nothing}} of the kind, with my consent," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer. [...] "I will have no such nonsense. Don't flatter {{yourself}} that I will. Even if I approved of such a thing, I should think it wicked to let you do it. You're always fancying yourself doing something very devoted, but I've never seen you {{ready to give up}} your own will, or your own comfort even, in the slightest degree. And Dan Mavering, if he were twice as <b>temporising</b> and circuitous"--the word came to her from her talk with him--"would be twice too good for you. I'm going to breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|At that {{scarcely}} covert avowal of {{his passion}} she recoiled a step as she might before a thing unclean. The little colour faded from her cheek, the scorn departed from her lip, and a sickly, deadly fear overspread her lovely face. God! that I should {{stand there and}} witness this insult to the woman I adored and worshipped with a fervour that the Church seeks to instil into us for those about the throne of Heaven. It might not be. A blind access of fury took me. Of the consequences I thought nothing. Reason left me utterly, and the slight hope that might lie in <b>temporising</b> was disregarded.|$|E
6000|$|Footnote: 1. From this Epilogue we learn, what is {{confirmed}} by many proofs [...] elsewhere, that the attribute for which James desired to be [...] distinguished and praised, was that of openness of purpose, and [...] stern undeviating inflexibility of conduct. He scorned to disguise [...] his designs, either upon the religion or the constitution of his [...] country. He forgot {{that it was only}} the <b>temporising</b> concessions of [...] his brother which secured his way to the throne, when his [...] exclusion, or a civil war, seemed the only alternatives. His [...] brother was the reed, which bent before the whirlwind, and [...] recovered its erect posture when it had passed away; and James, the [...] inflexible oak, which the first tempest rooted up for ever.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a quick}} but entirely respectful {{discussion}} of the situation. They thought him a lunatic who had tramped into, this neighbourhood ignorant of Bill. They desired to <b>temporise</b> until their leader came. Bill would settle him. Some one spoke of Bill.|$|R
60|$|This was how I fenced with him, {{this was}} {{the manner in which}} I {{followed}} Mariani's sound advice that I should <b>temporise!</b> Oh! I know that my words were the words of a fool, yet no fear that Ramiro would inspire me could have restrained them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot,' said Mr Dombey, {{rising as}} he spoke, 'consent to <b>temporise</b> or treat with you, Mrs Dombey, upon a subject {{as to which}} you are in {{possession}} of my opinions and expectations. I have stated my ultimatum, Madam, and have only to request your very serious attention to it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Bashti did not rage as {{he would}} have done had he been alone. Before the eyes of his chief priest he disdained to lower himself to such commonness of humanity. Thus it is always with those in the high places, ever <b>temporising</b> with their natural desires, ever masking their ordinariness under a show of disinterest. So it was that Bashti {{displayed}} no vexation at the disappointment to his appetite. Agno was a shade less controlled, for he could not quite chase away the eager light in his eyes. Bashti glimpsed it and mistook it for simple curiosity of observation not guessing its real nature. Which goes to show two things of those in the high place: one, that they may fool those beneath them; the other, that they may be fooled by those beneath them.|$|E
60|$|My {{inclination}} to refuse {{the whole thing}} increased rather than diminished at first as I went along the Embankment. In my uncle's presence {{there had been a}} sort of glamour that had prevented an outright refusal. It was a revival of affection for him I felt in his presence, I think, in part, and in part an instinctive feeling that I must consider him as my host. But much more was it a curious persuasion he had the knack of inspiring--a persuasion not so much of his integrity and capacity as of the reciprocal and yielding foolishness of the world. One felt that he was silly and wild, but in some way silly and wild after the fashion of the universe. After all, one must live somehow. I astonished him and myself by <b>temporising.</b>|$|E
60|$|Edwin {{released}} his hold at once, and Thomson raised {{himself in the}} seat, clenching his teeth and fists as he did so. He {{was one of those}} savage creatures who, when roused, appear to go mad, and become utterly regardless of consequences. While Sam was engaged in e <b>temporising</b> handcuffs for Jenkins and Smith out of a necktie and a pocket-handkerchief, Thomson sat perfectly still, but breathed very hard. He was only resting a little to recover strength, for in a moment, without a sound or warning of any kind, he hit Edwin with all his force on the temple. Fortunately the youth saw the coming blow in time to partially give way to it, and in another moment the struggle was renewed, but terminated almost as quickly, for Edwin gave Thomson a blow that stunned him and kept him quiet for the next quarter of an hour.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the fort had been started by the Count of Soissons in 1620 during the first Huguenot rebellion.

6000|$|... 2. The Trimmers, a body {{small and}} unpopular, as {{must always be}} the [...] case with those, who in violent times declare for {{moderate}} and [...] <b>temporising</b> measures, were headed by the ingenious and politic [...] Halifax. He had much of the confidence, at least of the countenance [...] of Charles, who was divided betwixt tenderness for Monmouth, and [...] love of ease, on the one hand, and, on the other, desire of [...] arbitrary power, and something like fear of the duke of York. [...] Halifax repeatedly prevented each of these parties from subjugating [...] the other, and his ambidexter services {{seem to have been}} rewarded [...] by the sincere hatred of both. In 1688 was published a vindication [...] of this party, entitled, [...] "the Character of a Trimmer;" [...] and his [...] opinion of,--I. The laws of government. II. Protestant Religion. [...] III. Foreign affairs. By the Hon. Sir William Coventry.|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} to my purpose. When there is {{anything}} deficient in numbers and sound, the reader is uneasy and unsatisfied; he wants something of his complement, desires somewhat which he finds not: and this being the manifest defect of Horace, {{it is no wonder}} that, finding it supplied in Juvenal, we are more delighted with him. And besides this, the sauce of Juvenal is more poignant, to create in us an appetite of reading him. The meat of Horace is more nourishing, but the cookery of Juvenal more exquisite; so that, granting Horace to be the more general philosopher, we cannot deny that Juvenal was the greater poet--I mean, in satire. His thoughts are sharper, his indignation against vice is more vehement, his spirit has more of the commonwealth genius; he treats tyranny, and all the vices attending it, as they deserve, with the utmost rigour; and consequently a noble soul is better pleased with a zealous vindicator of Roman liberty than with a <b>temporising</b> poet, a well- mannered court slave, and a man who is often afraid of laughing in the right place--who is ever decent, because he is naturally servile.|$|E
6000|$|I wish to draw {{particular}} attention to the last part of this message, which is extremely typical of the line of policy adopted throughout in the Transvaal business. The English Government dared not make any further concession to the Boers, because they felt that they had already strained the temper of the country almost to breaking in the matter. On the other hand, they were afraid that if they did not do something, the Boers would tear up the Convention, and they would find themselves {{face to face with the}} old difficulty. Under these circumstances, they have fallen back upon their <b>temporising</b> and un-English policy, which leaves them a back-door to escape through, whatever turn things take. Should the Boers now suddenly turn round and declare, which is extremely probable, that they repudiate their debt to us, or that they are sick of the presence of a British Resident, the Government will be able to announce that [...] "the necessity for further concession" [...] has now been [...] "proved by experience," [...] and thus escape the difficulty. In short, this telegram has deprived the Convention of whatever finality it may have possessed, and made it, as a document, as worthless as it is as a practical settlement. That this is the view taken of it by the Boers themselves, is proved by the text of the Ratification which followed on the receipt of this telegram.|$|E
60|$|She knew {{of course}} that the King would not allow himself to be put off with vague promises. Within the two days' delay which she had asked of him he would begin {{to realize that she}} had only meant to <b>temporise,</b> and never had any {{intention}} of helping him in his nefarious schemes. Then he would begin to act for himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer, {{recovering}} her good-humour {{in view of}} {{a situation}} that she felt herself able to cope with. [...] "Of course he has to <b>temporise,</b> to manage a little. She's an invalid, and of course she's very exacting. He has to humour her. How do you know he has promised her? He hasn't promised us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing,' said Mr Dombey, 'but this. You will be {{good enough}} to observe, Carker, that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or may be charged, admits of reply. You {{will be good}} enough to bring me no reply. Mrs Dombey is {{informed}} that it does not become me to <b>temporise</b> or treat upon any matter that is at issue between us, and that what I say is final.' ...|$|R
60|$|To {{these four}} came {{the news of}} Prince Charlie's landing, and set them {{presently}} by the ears. My lord, like the chimney-keeper that he was, was all for <b>temporising.</b> Miss Alison held the other side, because it appeared romantical; and the Master (though I have heard they did not agree often) was for this once of her opinion. The adventure tempted him, as I conceive; he was tempted by the opportunity to raise {{the fortunes of the}} house, and not less by the hope of paying off his private liabilities, which were heavy beyond all opinion. As for Mr. Henry, it appears he said little enough at first; his part came later on. It took the three a whole day's disputation before they agreed to steer a middle course, one son going forth to strike a blow for King James, my lord and the other staying at home to keep in favour with King George. Doubtless this was my lord's decision; and, as is well known, it was the part played by many considerable families. But the one dispute settled, another opened. For my lord, Miss Alison, and Mr. Henry all held the one view: that it was the cadet's part to go out; and the Master, what with restlessness and vanity, would at no rate consent to stay at home. My lord pleaded, Miss Alison wept, Mr. Henry was very plain spoken: all was of no avail.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the last}} forty years England has lost {{one by one}} each of those enthusiasms which may have been illusions,--some of them {{undoubtedly}} were so,--but which at least testified to the existence among us, in a very considerable degree, of a vivid belief in the possibility of certain broad general theories being true and right, {{as well as in the}} obligation of making them lights to practical conduct and desire. People a generation ago had eager sympathy with Hungary, with Italy, with Poland, because they were deeply impressed by the doctrine of nationalities. They had again a generous and energetic hatred of such an institution as the negro slavery of America, because justice and humanity and religion were too real and potent forces within their breasts to allow them to listen to those political considerations by which American statesmen used to justify <b>temporising</b> and compromise. They had strong feelings about Parliamentary Reform, because they were penetrated by the principle that the possession of political power by the bulk of a society is the only effective security against sinister government; or else by the principle that participation in public activity, even in the modest form of an exercise of the elective franchise, is an elevating and instructing agency; or perhaps by the principle that justice demands that those who are compelled to obey laws and pay national taxes should have a voice in making the one and imposing the other.|$|E
6000|$|All these {{thoughts}} thronged upon {{him when he}} took possession of the secret chamber. The iron lamp, the unfurnished apartment, more resembling a prison than a place of ordinary repose, the hoarse and ceaseless sound of the waves rushing against {{the base of the}} rock on which the castle was founded, saddened and perplexed his mind. To his own successful machinations, the ruin of the family had been in a great measure owing, but his disposition was crafty, and not cruel; so that actually to witness the desolation and distress he had himself occasioned was as painful to him as it would be to the humane mistress of a family to superintend in person the execution of the lambs and poultry which are killed by her own directions. At the same time, when he thought of the alternative of restoring to Ravenswood a large proportion of his spoils, or of adopting, as an ally and member of his own family, the heir of this impoverished house, he felt as the spider may be supposed to do when his whole web, the intricacies of which had been planned with so much art, is destroyed by the chance sweep of a broom. And then, if he should commit himself too far in this matter, it gave rise to a perilous question, which many a good husband, when under temptation to act as a free agent, has asked himself without being able to return a satisfactory answer: [...] "What will my wife--what will Lady Ashton say?" [...] On the whole, he came at length to the resolution in which minds of a weaker cast so often take refuge. He resolved to watch events, to take advantage of circumstances as they occurred, and regulate his conduct accordingly. In this spirit of <b>temporising</b> policy, he at length composed his mind to rest.|$|E
6000|$|That was all, {{with its}} touch of {{experience}} and its hint of philosophy; but it was stupefying. She was already then positively again [...] "so clever?" [...] This was really more than I could as yet provide an explanation for, but I was pressed; Brissenden would have reached his wife's room again, and I <b>temporised.</b> [...] "It was her cleverness that held you so that when I passed you couldn't look at me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Highmore hesitated. [...] "It {{appears that}} she doesn't seem in a hurry. Ray {{at any rate}} has jumped too far ahead of her. He should have <b>temporised</b> a little, Mr. Bousefield says; but I'm {{beginning}} to think, you know," [...] said my companion, [...] "that Ray can't temporise." [...] Fresh from my emotions of the previous twenty-four hours I was scarcely {{in a position to}} disagree with her. [...] "He published too much pure thought." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{all this}} ominous talk I felt my heart shrivel like a fire-withered leaf, if I may use that figure, and my blood assume the {{temperature}} and consistency of ice-cream. Earnestly did I curse myself for having allowed my curiosity about matters which we {{are not meant to}} understand to bring me to the edge of such a choice. Swiftly I determined to <b>temporise,</b> which I did by asking Ayesha whether she would accompany me upon this eerie expedition.|$|R
