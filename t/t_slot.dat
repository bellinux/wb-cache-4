This enhanced physical layer capability enables the system to accumulate information even when the link between two nodes is not good and a packet cannot be decoded within a slot. The result is an expansion of the stability region of the system. The accumulation process does not satisfy the i. i. d assumption that underlies many previous analysis in this area. Therefore it also brings new challenges to the problem. We propose two dynamic scheduling algorithms to overcome this difficulty. One performs scheduling every <b>T</b> <b>slot,</b> which inevitably increases average delay in the system, but approaches the boundary of the stability region. The second constructs a virtual system with the same stability region. Through controlling the virtual queues in the constructed system, we avoid the non-i. i. d difficulty and attains the stability region. We derive performance bounds under both algorithms and compare them through simulation results. I...|$|E

The {{effect of}} mouthrinses on oral malodor: a {{systematic}} review. Abstract:  Objective: The {{objective of this}} study is to systematically review the literature regarding the impact of mouthrinses on oral malodor and present evidence for the treatment effects of mouthrinses on oral malodor. Material and methods: PubMed-MEDLINE, the Cochrane-CENTRAL and EMBASE were searched through February 10, 2012 to identify appropriate studies. Volatile sulphur compound measurements, organoleptic measurements and tongue coating were selected as outcome variables. Search results: The independent screenings of 333 unique titles and paper abstracts revealed 12 publications (12 experiments) that met the eligibility criteria. Means and standard deviations were extracted. The results were separated into short-term (< 3  weeks) and longer-term (≥ 3  weeks) studies. Conclusion: In this review, nearly all mouthwashes with active ingredients had beneficial effects in reducing oral malodor in both short- and longer-term studies. The most compelling evidence was provided for chlorhexidine mouthwashes, and those that contained a combination of cetyl pyridinum chloride and zinc provided the best evidence profile on oral malodor. Little data with respect to tongue coating were available, and none of the studies showed a beneficial effect for this parameter. status: publishe...|$|E

In these environments, the readers within reader-to-reader interference range must transmit at different times, otherwise tags cannot identified. This resource allocation problem is addressed for both static and dynamic Frame Slotted Aloha, which are the most broadly extended mechanism used in UHF RFID systems. The goal is maximizing the expected number of tags successfully identified within the <b>t</b> <b>slots.</b> Results demonstrate that the optimal solution outperforms an assignment proportional {{to the number of}} tags in each reader.

30|$|The OP- 1 in Section 3.3 is {{difficult}} to solve since it involves an optimization over <b>T</b> time <b>slots,</b> M subcarriers, K users, and with MAC-layer QoS requirements. The CBS {{should be able to}} allocate the subcarriers and power to K SUs at the beginning of <b>T</b> time <b>slots</b> based on the solution of OP- 1, therefore, in OP- 1, the knowledge of future channel gains (i.e., the channel gain at future time slots) is required. However, it is impossible for the CBS to obtain future channel information, so, we need to simplify the QoS requirements over <b>T</b> time <b>slots</b> to one time slot. In the following section, we formulate problem OP- 2, which is a power minimization problem to find the minimum transmit power that can guarantee the QoS requirements for SUs during τ time <b>slots</b> (τ < <b>T),</b> so as to transform the MAC-layer QoS constraints over <b>T</b> time <b>slots</b> to less time slots.|$|R

This distributed algorithm is the variation of a heuristic stochastic local search algorithm. In this algorithm, each user chooses a random action and uses it for a fixed number of time <b>slots</b> (say <b>T).</b> Then each user finds weighted sum of the utilities (since each user receives ACK/NACK of other users, it can calculate this quantity). After <b>T</b> <b>slots,</b> a user experiments randomly with probability say, ρ, and then with some probability updates the action profile according to its channel state. Now, one user uses this action for next <b>T</b> <b>slots</b> and the other users use the previous action. Based on the weighted sum of utilities, the particular user defines a benchmark.

In single-channel environments, the readers within mutual interference range must transmit at different times; otherwise, interferences prevent identification of the tags. The goal is to maximize the expected number of tags successfully identified within the <b>t</b> <b>slots.</b> This problem may be formulated as a mixed integer non-linear mathematical program, which may effectively exploit available knowledge {{about the number of}} competing tags in the reading zone of each reader. In this paper, we present this optimization problem and analyze the impact of tag estimation in the performance achieved by the scheduler. The results demonstrate that optimal solutions outperform a reference scheduler based on dividing the available slots proportionally to the number of tags in each reader. In addition, depending on the scenario load, the results reveal that there exist an optimum number of readers for the topology considered, since the total average number of identifications depend non-linearly on the load. Finally, we study the effect of imperfect tag population knowledge on the performance achieved by the readers.|$|R
