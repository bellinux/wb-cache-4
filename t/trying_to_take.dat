5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's account of what happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, except that he said he was the one, not Laura, who had objected to the shotgun being removed from the wall. He said Laura had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E

5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes {{estimated}} that Argos {{would be easier}} to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The people of the city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies. The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, {{one of the most famous}} generals of the age, had been killed while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself.

As an arranger you're usually <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|Ulrezaj reappears {{several years}} later, {{residing}} on Aiur {{where he is}} manipulating a faction of Protoss survivors who were not evacuated. Ulrezaj uses these Protoss to attempt to capture a Terran archaeologist, Jacob Ramsey, who has the powerful mind of a Protoss archivist, Zamara, residing in his own mind; their {{failure to do so}} leads to Ulrezaj personally <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Ramsey, but the archaeologist escapes through a warp gate while both Zerg and Valerian Mengsk's forces also attempt to capture him. Ulrezaj traces Ramsey to Ehlna, breaking through the defenses of both the Protoss and the Dominion. However, Zamara uses her last energy to lock Ulrezaj's mind into a storage crystal, sacrificing herself to keep Ulrezaj trapped.|$|E
5|$|While still {{popular with}} the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in {{improving}} Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation. Allan Savory, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the Bill for {{the composition of the}} proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government was not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over broadcasting.|$|E

She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence.

Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E
5|$|Macaulay's {{final two}} seasons were {{affected}} by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by rheumatism. In the 1934 season, while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball. He did not appear for Yorkshire until June, but went on to take 55 wickets {{at an average of}} 23.43. The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches, taking 22 wickets at 20.09. At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of £250. Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; Frank Smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, {{but it was not until}} Ellis Robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.|$|E

In the same telecast, Daniels accused Styles of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his spot as the contender for the championship due to Styles having thrown in the towel for Daniels.

5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

5|$|Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone {{is ready}} to hand over his title {{as the leader of}} Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A {{competition}} is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall head back to New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes the car into the church and shoots her. It is then revealed that she is really Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins to repress his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream.|$|E
