5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with <b>their</b> <b>father.</b> Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked <b>their</b> <b>father</b> to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When <b>their</b> <b>father</b> dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E

40|$|Recent social {{stratification}} scholarship examines {{the influence of}} parental status or big-class on individuals’ career attainment. The authors draw on the recent micro-class approach to hypothesize {{on the influence of}} the father’s micro-class or occupation-specific resources on individuals’ careers, and study (1) how often individuals work in <b>their</b> <b>father’s</b> occupation and (2) how the father’s micro-class resources affect career progression. Using life-course data on the careers of Dutch men and women, the authors find that 15 percent of men and 5 percent of women enter <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> occupation during <b>their</b> career. Further, men are not able to use <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> resources to achieve career progression after they left <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> occupation. Women’s career progression seems less influenced by <b>their</b> <b>father’s</b> occupation-specific resources...|$|R

60|$|Now, here is {{the great}} {{difference}} between animals and men. Among the higher animals, the mothers always, and the fathers sometimes, feed, and help, and protect their young: but we seldom or never find that young animals help and protect their parents; certainly, they never obey <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> when they are full grown, but are as ready to tear <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> in pieces as <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> are to tear them: so that the love and obedience of full-grown sons to <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> is so utterly human a thing, so utterly different from anything we find in the brutes, that we must {{believe it to be}} part of man's immortal soul, part of God's likeness in man.|$|R

5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what <b>their</b> <b>father</b> had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about <b>their</b> <b>father,</b> the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

Bachmann and Schwaiger avoid the closed novel form, writing non-chronologically by breaking up their works with dreams, diaries, letters and conversation...|$|R
