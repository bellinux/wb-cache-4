50|$|Interest {{expenses}} {{are part of}} the group's total income. Thus, it is ensured that the actual costs are deducted (net principle). <b>Tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is not possible because business expenses do reduce the income of all companies proportionately to their respective share of the overall profit. Companies cannot claim expenses in a high-tax jurisdiction, while profits are taxed in low-tax jurisdictions. However, <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is possible in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. Consequently, the European Commission proposes to introduce an anti-abuse rule which limits the interest deductibility.|$|E
5000|$|From 2005, all European Union listed {{companies}} have to prepare their financial statements using the [...] "International Financial Reporting Standards" [...] ("IFRS"), as modified by the EU. Other UK companies may choose to adopt IFRS. Corporation tax law is changing so that, in the future, IFRS accounting profits are largely respected. The exception is for certain financial instruments and certain other measures to prevent <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> between companies applying IFRS and companies applying UK GAAP.|$|E
5000|$|State Unemployment <b>Tax</b> (SUTA) <b>arbitrage,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "SUTA dumping," [...] occurs when an employer with a high unemployment insurance rate transfers or [...] "dumps" [...] employees to purchased subsidiaries with lower unemployment insurance rates. In a PEO relationship, the client company takes the Professional Employer Organization's SUTA rate by law, which often lowers their SUTA through SUTA Arbitrage. The only time this wouldn't apply is in client reporting states.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} documents positive ex-dividend day {{returns in}} excess of one percent in the unique institutional setting of Hong Kong, where neither dividends nor capital gains are <b>taxed.</b> Short-term <b>arbitrage</b> trades around the ex-day were hampered by physical settlement procedures. After the recent switch to an electronic settlement system, which enables such trades, ex-day abnormal returns have declined to an insignificant 0. 17 percent. This drop is more pronounced for high yield stocks, which {{are more likely to}} attract dividend capture trading. The evidence points to the crucial role of short-term traders in ensuring the pricing efficiency of financial markets. The role of short-term traders in financial markets is a matter of considerable controversy. The debate on this issue has heightened {{in the wake of the}} recent Asian currency crisis, which some governments blamed on the activities of short-term traders. Critics contend that short-term traders engage in speculation leading to [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|In economics, {{regulatory}} arbitrage (sometimes, <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage)</b> {{may be used}} to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. For example, an insurance company may choose to locate in Bermuda due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. This can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location: in the case of many financial products, it may be unclear [...] "where" [...] the transaction occurs.|$|E
50|$|Term life {{insurance}} alternative, for example when a policy owner {{wants to use}} interest income from a lump sum of cash to pay a term {{life insurance}} premium. An alternative {{is to use the}} lump sum to pay premiums into a UL policy on a single premium or limited premium basis, creating <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> when the costs of insurance are paid from untaxed excess interest credits, which may be crediting at a higher rate than other guaranteed, no risk asset classes (e.g. U.S. Treasury Bonds or U.S. Savings Bonds).|$|E
50|$|The {{taxpayer}} was a saver who {{was convinced}} {{to buy a}} deferred annuity because the inside buildup on such policies is tax-deferred. However, he wanted to claim a deduction on the money he borrowed {{that he used to}} buy the annuity. The IRS won and the taxpayer was denied the deduction. An understanding of the economics would immediately reveal that the only reason the transaction had any chance of making sense for the taxpayer was the asymmetric way the-then current tax code allowed a current deduction on the loan liability at the same time allowed tax deferral on the purchased asset. Success would have legitimated <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage.</b>|$|E
40|$|Globalisation and {{regional}} integration increase the scope for movement between jurisdictions. As a result, <b>tax</b> policy <b>arbitrage</b> and policy convergence {{can be expected}} to constrain public policy choices. Nevertheless, regional integration can also enable the policy-makers to reclaim policy autonomy as the rates of return on constituent loyalty are equalized by convergent policy choices. This paper reviews the debate and develops an analytical framework that enables us to explain the linkages between and policy implication of globalisation {{and regional}} integration in an open-ended manner. We propose a political economy framework that differentiates between market-driven and institutionalized policy convergence under increased interjurisdictional mobility. The proposed analytical framework is applied to the EU's experience in tax policy coordination. We observe that globalisation and the deepening of European integration have in fact enabled EU and national policy-makers to reclaim policy autonomy and make attempts to halt/reverse the market-driven process of tax competition. Although the pro-active co-ordination effort is still in its infancy, it constitutes a significant development that stands in contrast to the prisoners' dilemma outcomes of the 1980 s and early 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|Widening social disparities {{represent}} a fundamental {{danger to the}} viability of civilized societies. They are corrosive of social solidarity and economically dysfunctional. Combatting such disparities should be a primary function of modern democratic states. The task is multi-faceted, however, and not simply confined to the optimal use of state transfers to increase the household income of the poorest sections of society. This chapter focuses, in particular, {{on the need to}} reverse the widening of market income disparities typical of the neoliberal era, as well as the priority of guaranteeing sufficient tax revenues for states to eradicate the evils of poverty and social deprivation. This would require an end to tax competition between European and other states, the elimination of <b>tax</b> and regulatory <b>arbitrage</b> by transnational corporations and the restoration of viable systems of progressive income tax in all European countries...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Global Financial Crisis, there has been an {{understandable}} focus on the financial fragility and contagion aspects of shadow banking. This article argues that shadow banking is important for another set of reasons. It has been well established that shadow banking permits the transformation of assets and financial claims. It has also been established that fiscal and regulatory arbitrage occurs through shadow banking, and associated offshore financial activities. The article develops the argument that together these are transforming the times and spaces of modern finance, and directly challenging earlier spatio-temporal concepts of finance, and the regulatory/jurisdictional order built on them. The article suggests that the longer term significance of shadow banking may not just be its role in financial crisis, or even <b>tax</b> and regulatory <b>arbitrage,</b> but that it was here that innovative forms of capital were produced and generalised which transcended the spaces and times of earlier institutional, transactional and jurisdictional concepts of capital and wealth...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "check-the-box" [...] {{regulations}} {{paved the}} way for various new tax avoidance and tax deferral strategies. Specifically, they expanded the opportunity for [...] "hybrid branch" [...] or [...] "hybrid entity" [...] strategies, which take advantage of differences in the classification of an entity as a corporation or not in multiple jurisdictions, in order to engage in cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> The possibility that the check-the-box rules would greatly expand the potential for such strategies had been pointed out prior to implementation, and at one point some commentators suggested disallowing foreign entities from electing their classification at all; however, in the end, the IRS, while acknowledging such concerns, issued regulations which gave foreign and domestic entities largely similar powers to elect their own classification.|$|E
50|$|Views of {{offshore}} financial centres tend to be polarised. Proponents suggest that reputable {{offshore financial centres}} play a legitimate and integral role in international finance and trade, and that their zero-tax structure allows financial planning and risk management and makes possible some of the cross-border vehicles necessary for global trade, including financing for aircraft and shipping or reinsurance of medical facilities. Proponents point to the tacit support {{of offshore}} centres by {{the governments of the}} United States (which promotes offshore financial centres by the continuing use of the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC)) and United Kingdom (which actively promotes offshore finance in Caribbean dependent territories to help them diversify their economies and to facilitate the British Eurobond market). Opponents view them as draining tax revenues away from developed countries by allowing <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> and rendering capital flows into and out of developing countries opaque. Very few commentators express neutral views.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the ex-dividend stock price behaviour in the Portuguese Stock Exchange between 1993 and 2002, a unique period {{characterized by a}} richness of different investor tax statuses and several tax changes. After classifying investors according to their tax profile and corresponding dividend tax discrimination factorss, {{we find that the}} pursuit of a short-term trading strategy around the ex-dividend day does not yield significant abnormal returns after tax and bid-ask costs. These results are in accordance with the inexistence of arbitrage opportunities even when extreme tax situations are considered under different dividend yield scenarios. It is also shown that the observed ex-dividend price reduction is consistent with a tax explanation and in disagreement with market microstructure arguments. Further tests indicate that the price change is not significantly different from the expected theoretical price reduction for a marginal investor which we identified most likely as a long-term shareholder in high-tax brackets. Finally, our results only provide a weak support for the clientele hypothesis. ex-dividend pricing, <b>arbitrage,</b> <b>taxes,</b> international financial markets, market efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} corporate, {{marketing and}} product distribution {{strategies in the}} cost and revenue efficiency across a sample of life insurers that operate in European markets with the highest insurance concentration and density. We predict that these strategies are also affected by segmentation and cross-country differences in regulatory type (“alpine ” vs. “atlantic”), which facilitate managerial opportunistic behaviour in choice of distribution strategy. This contrasts with the standard market efficiency hypothesis, which predicts that firms that adopt one of three generic strategies (cost, customer focus and product differentiation) are more efficient than rivals that fail to adopt one of these strategies. Our results support the prediction of the market imperfection hypothesis that firms with non-exclusive distribution systems are less costly and profit-efficient. We also find that firms surviving the recent financial crisis rely on exclusive distribution channels, product differentiation and experience the highest degree of change in cost efficiency over time of increasing deregulation. These findings imply that imperfections in these markets are driven {{by a combination of}} <b>tax</b> incentives, regulatory <b>arbitrage</b> and technology transfer of larger firms that exploit their size and dominance to use multiple distribution systems, which are more costly and profit-efficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{private equity}} {{market has been}} a hot topic of debate since it first started to emerge. As {{it has become more}} {{frequently}} apparent in the Swedish economic and financial market, the debate regarding its impact in Sweden has also risen. The debate contains various opinions whether the private equity firms, through buyouts uses <b>tax</b> breaks or <b>arbitrage</b> opportuni-ties to "quick flip" the investments on the expense of workers and wages or if the PE firms create operational and economic value. Previous studies regarding this topic have mostly been conducted in the U. S, Canada or to some extent in the U. K. This paper aims to, through a quantitative method, investigate and present whether the buyouts have an impact on Swedish portfolio companies or not, and if they do, what kind of impact the buyouts have. This will be done through an event study, based on data collection from portfolio companies that have experienced a buyout made by a private equity firm. The data will then be compared with data from peer groups and ana-lyzed through statistical methods in SPSS. The main findings in this thesis suggest that buyouts do not have, neither a positive nor negative impact on the performance of portfolio companies in Sweden. The tests allow us to conclude that PE firms do not have market timing skills. Neither can we conclude that PE firms cause layoffs of workers or lowering of wages...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{international}} <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> has proven {{a difficult and}} at times intractable one. Rather than try to minimize costs of the arbitrage or prevent “abuse” {{of the laws of}} a particular regime, the United States should also consider affirmatively bearing some of the costs of international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> to further the policy of international vertical equity and transform the incentives that led to the current worldwide non-cooperative equilibrium, and thus the rise of international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> in the first place. Harnessing the costs of international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> transactions will not always be the appropriate response to each particular arbitrage transaction. Harnessing the costs of the international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> should be considered, however, when such responses prove inadequate. At a minimum, in adopting such an approach the United States would provide some level of subsidy for investment in developing countries at little to no cost to the current international tax regime. At best, however, harnessing the costs of international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> could place of the issue of international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> back on the international scene, restart stalled international tax discussions and potentially move towards a greater worldwide consensus, not only on the international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> itself but on the larger issue of the role of international vertical equity in the worldwide tax regime. In a second-best world, United States unilateral action in harnessing the costs of international <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> may be the first step towards a first-best solution...|$|E
40|$|Cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> arises where a {{transaction}} {{is subject to}} two or more countries 2 ̆ 7 differing tax regimes. Conflicts between the tax rules create unique opportunities for the parties to engage in profitable tax planning—opportunities {{that would not be}} available if the transaction occurred entirely domestically in one of the countries. These opportunities have been a growing feature of the multi-jurisdictional business world and have raised issues concerning whether and how countries, such as the United States, should respond. This Article examines cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> in the context of both domestic tax policy and of other international tax issues, and considers potential responses. It proposes an analytic framework for cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> based on specific case studies. The Article concludes by pro-posing a balancing test for determining the appropriate treatment of specific instances of cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage...</b>|$|E

40|$|Although <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{is central}} to the literatures on tax capitalization, {{implicit}} taxes, and even capital structure, there is little empirical evidence {{of the extent to which}} firms actually engage in <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> This paper provides some evidence on the topic by focusing on a simple and observable corporate arbitrage strategy in the market for municipal bonds. It poses a puzzle for the literature, however, in that we find little evidence of municipal bond <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by non-financial corporations. The overwhelming majority of firms are not engaging in the arbitrage at all and even among those engaged in arbitrage, many firms do less than a safe-harbor amount allowed by the tax authorities. Such a pattern is consistent with the presence of both fixed and marginal (i. e., that depend on size of the position) costs of arbitrage, though we cannot observe what those costs are. ...|$|E

The authors develop the idea of forward tax rates and compute forward tax rates for 1955 - 84.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{opportunities}} in rental housing markets arise when high bracket taxpayers exploit the tax shelter and conversion {{features of the}} tax treatment of rental housing {{and as a consequence}} offer low bracket taxpayers rental housing at a cost lower than if they purchased the same quantity of housing for owner occupation. A microdata set has been employed to estimate the size of these <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities with respect to 1907 properties owned by Australian landlords. The measure of <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities is the breakeven tax rate at which the maximum rental rate a potential occupant is prepared to pay before turning to purchased housing is equal to the landlord&# 039;s reservation rental rate. Potential occupants with marginal tax rates below the breakeven tax rate find that renting has a relative cost advantage over home purchase. When agency costs (the costs incurred in managing landlord-tenant relationships) are included in the <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> model, our estimates of the breakeven tax rate indicate that home purchase has a relative cost advantage over renting for most potential occupants. Renting is only financially attractive to low tax bracket individuals. This finding is consistent with Australian tenure patterns. However, there are more puzzling results. A majority of landlords belong to tax brackets below the top bracket, landlords in the lowest tax brackets typically make below normal profits, and reservation rental rates {{at the bottom of the}} rental housing market are relatively high. Down payment requirements, lock-in effects, and rent clientele groups are put forward as possible explanations for these findings...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine how}} tax {{avoidance}} {{in the form}} of trade in well-functioning asset markets affects the basic labor supply model. We argue that models that integrate <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> and labor supply decisions may shed light on a number of positive and normative questions concerning modern systems of income taxation. Such models also appear to have strong implications for empirical research. Studies that ignore the effects of <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> and asset trade on labor supply incentives may easily come up with biased estimates of the tax responsiveness of the hours supply of high-wage individuals. Finally, because of tax avoidance {{in the form of}} asset trade, international comparisons of income inequality will exaggerate the redistributive achievements of high-tax countries like Sweden. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this book}} {{is to examine the}} Swedish income tax {{treatment}} of derivatives, to ascertain the extent to which this treatment provides <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities, and to present possible solution that may prevent existing arbitrage opportunities. This study establishes that {{there are two types of}} financial instruments that constitute the greatest challenges regarding <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities in the Swedish income tax system: hybrid financial instruments and synthetic instruments. These instruments challenge the Swedish income tax system because their legal form is not always in accordance with their economic substance. Accordingly, to prevent <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities related to derivatives and other financial instruments in the long run, it is necessary to draft relevant income tax provisions in a way that better mirrors the economic substance of these instruments. As a benchmark for such provisions, the international accounting standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is presented and evaluated. The topic and findings are of interest to academics and are highly relevant to practitioners and government officials in the area of income taxation. Although the focus is the Swedish income tax system, the material in this book has application to other countries as well...|$|E

40|$|High {{progressive}} tax rates on capital income induce <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage</b> between income items and across borders. To reduce such <b>tax</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> the Nordic countries, most notable Finland and Norway, have introduced dual income taxes (DITs). Under the DIT, all capital income, including corporate profits, is taxed at a uniform, proportional rate. By contrast, labor income is taxed at higher, progressive rates. The DIT {{could serve as}} the model for taxing capital income in the member states of the European Union, particularly if agreement is reached on the comprehensive application of the source entitlement principle. This would move the DIT {{in the direction of the}} comprehensive business income tax (CBIT), proposed by U. S. Treasury.
