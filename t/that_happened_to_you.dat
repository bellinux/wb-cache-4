You're a middle-aged man. You're set. You like life to jog along at a peaceful walk. This girl {{wants it to be}} a fox-trot. You've got habits which you have had for a dozen years. I ask you, is she the sort of girl to be content to be a stepmother to a middle-aged man's habits? Of course, if you were really in love with her, if she were your mate, and all that sort of thing, you would take a pleasure in making yourself over to suit her requirements. But you aren't in love with her. You are simply caught by her looks. I tell you, you ought to look on that moment when she gave you back your ring as the luckiest moment of your life. You ought to make a sort of anniversary of it. You ought to endow a hospital or something out of pure gratitude. I don't know how long you're going to live--if you act like a grown-up man instead of a boy and keep out of woods and shrubberies at night you may live for ever--but you will never have a greater bit of luck than the one <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to-night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The time came, {{before the}} {{following}} winter, when Hewson was tempted beyond his strength, {{and told the}} story of his apparition. He told it more than once, and kept himself with increasing difficulty from lying about it. He always wished to add something, to amplify the fact, to heighten the mystery of the circumstances, to divine the occult significance of the incident. In itself the incident, when stated, was rather bare and insufficient; but he held himself rigidly to the actual details, and he felt that in this at least he was offering the powers which had vouchsafed him the experience a species of atonement for breaking faith with them. It seemed like breaking faith with Miss Hernshaw, too, though this impression would have been harder to reason than the other. Both impressions began to wear off after the first tellings of the story; the wound that Hewson gave his sensibility in the very first cicatrized before the second, and at the fourth or fifth it had quite calloused over; so that he did not mind anything so much as what always seemed to him the inadequate effect of his experience with his hearers. Some listened carelessly; some nervously; some incredulously, {{as if he were trying}} to put up a job on them; some compassionately, as if he were not quite right, and ought to be looked after. There was a consensus of opinion, among those who offered any sort of comment, that he ought to give it to the Psychical Research, and at the bottom of Hewson's heart, there was a dread that the spiritualists would somehow get hold of him. This remained to stay him, when the shame of breaking faith with Miss Hernshaw and with Mystery no longer restrained him from exploiting the fact. He was aware of lying in wait for opportunities of telling it, and he swore himself to tell it only upon direct provocation, or when the occasion seemed imperatively to demand it. He commonly brought it out to match some experience of another; but he could never deny a friendly appeal when he sat with some good fellows over their five-o'clock cocktails at the club, and one of them would say in behalf of a newcomer, [...] "Hewson, tell Wilkins that odd thing <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> up country, in the summer." [...] In complying he tried to save his self-respect by affecting a contemptuous indifference in the matter, and beginning reluctantly and pooh-poohingly. He had pangs afterwards as he walked home to dress for dinner, but his self-reproach was less afflicting as time passed. His suffering from it was never so great as from the slight passed upon his apparition, when Wilkins or what other it might be, would meet the suggestion that he should tell him about it, with the hurried interposition, [...] "Yes, I have heard that; good story." [...] This would make Hewson think that he was beginning to tell his story too often, and that perhaps the friend who suggested his doing so, was playing upon his forgetfulness. He wondered if he were really something of a bore with it, and whether men were shying off from him at the club on account of it. He fancied that might be the reason why the circle at the five-o'clock cocktails gradually diminished as the winter passed. He continued to join it till the chance offered of squarely refusing to tell Wilkins, or whoever, about the odd thing that had happened to him up country in the summer. Then he felt that he had in a manner retrieved himself, and could retire from the five-o'clock cocktails with honor.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{career in}} the {{pornography}} business was followed for two years by a crew from ABC Television, culminating in a January 2003 interview with Diane Sawyer {{as part of a}} Primetime Thursday segment on pornography. At one point in the interview Belladonna broke down in tears, when Sawyer asked her, [...] "You keep describing these awful things <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Yet, you keep smiling. Why?" [...] Belladonna's smile wavered and her eyes watered up. [...] "It's so I don't start crying," [...] she said. Part of the footage for the segment was an interview with Belladonna's sister, who had moved out to Los Angeles at Belladonna's urging, and who had gotten a job at Red Light District Films. Belladonna's sister revealed on-camera that despite her claims, Belladonna was actually quite depressed, and had recently been hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Another topic discussed in the interview was the fact that Belladonna had contracted chlamydia. The publicity provided by the interview boosted Belladonna's career.|$|E

40|$|Tan Siok Siok, a Singaporean filmmaker {{living in}} Beijing, {{decided to make}} a {{documentary}} about Twitter using Twitter to source for the film’s content. Twitter, sometimes called a microblog, is essentially a short messaging service over the Internet. Rather than make this film using classic and highly centralized methods, Tan decided to crowdsource the content, financing, and distribution outlets. Crowdsourcing, according to Jeff Howe, is “the act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent (usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people {{in the form of an}} open call. ” The Twittamentary website was launched in August 2009 with the invitation to, “Share a great story that answers the question: what is the most interesting thing <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> because of Twitter?” The project began with no clear vision of the final story, the source of the financing, or the cinemas or the auditoriums the film would be played in. If successful, all the pieces of this puzzle would come together as Twitter users from around the globe volunteered their stories and the needed resources. If successful, this experiment in filmmaking might change filmmaking by offering artists an alternate path around development hell...|$|E
