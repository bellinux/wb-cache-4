40|$|A {{refrigerated}} <b>truck</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is always}} under variable conditions. Not only weather changes but also {{loading and unloading}} processes can make the chamber behaviour dependent on time. A prediction of relevant properties distributions (velocity, temperature and relative humidity) in refrigerated chambers requires the simultaneous solution, by an iteration process, of the three-dimensional non-linear differential equations for the momentum and heat/mass transport. Basically, these two transport phenomena are coupled by the buoyancy force due to natural convection. However, especially for non-steady state thermal conditions, the high computations times become unattractive the simultaneous integration. For the majority of refrigerated <b>truck</b> <b>chambers,</b> in which the air flow is mainly dominated by forced convection, the equations can be decoupled and the two transport phenomena can be treated separately. Therefore, {{in the case of}} dynamic (transient) simulation, this strategy makes the problem much simpler and can strongly reduce the computation time. In this study the simulation method described here was applied in a case study modelling (steady and transient) and was validated by measurements taken from an experimental reduced-scale model.

50|$|In 1866 Earle's Cement {{acquired}} the cement {{works on the}} near the river bank and land south of the Victoria Dock Branch Line; the works was connected by rail sidings to the dock branch. Production was around 3000t pa of Roman cement in 1870. From 1875 bottle kilns were constructed {{for the production of}} Portland cement, with a capacity of 38t per week by around 1882. From 1888 <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> were installed, with 28 in total by 1898 with a total capacity of 980t per week. The first two Rotary kilns were installed in 1906, adding a capacity of 860t per week.

5000|$|The kilns were {{normally}} made of brick, and are {{one type}} of [...] "cross-draught" [...] kilns, where the flames travel more or less horizontally, rather than up from or down to the floor. The firing time could be relatively short, meaning about 24 hours for a small kiln. Early kilns were rising tunnels, not divided into chambers, but with a step at intervals giving relatively flat floor levels, and perhaps using gravel or similar material {{on the floor to}} allow vertical stacks to be rested. From the Southern Song period (1127-1279), some kilns were built as a series of chambers, stepped as they ran up the slope, and with connecting doors to allow access to both the kiln-workers during loading and unloading, and the heat during firing. There might be up to 12 <b>chambers.</b> <b>Chambered</b> <b>kilns</b> were usual for making Longquan celadon.|$|R
40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot <b>kiln.</b> The conditioning <b>chamber</b> opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the spray line must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the progressive kiln. This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s George Henry Skelsey used {{funds from}} a public listing of his company to build a cement plant, Port Adamant Works, at Barton, west of the Haven, {{replacing}} a site he had acquired in 1885 at Morley Street, Stoneferry, Hull in the 1880s. Clay and chalk for the process were sourced on site, with chalk brought from the New Cliff chalk quarry, by a short narrow gauge rail line. Initially the plant had a capacity of around 330t per week, using <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns,</b> supplemented by shaft kilns in around 1901 increasing weekly capacity by around 320 t. In 1911 the company became part of British Portland Cement Manufacturers, and a rotary kiln was installed in 1912 replacing the earlier kilns.

50|$|The kilns allowed large {{quantities}} of pottery to be fired at high temperatures, but the firing was not usually even across {{the length of the}} kiln, which often produced different effects on pieces at different levels. Very often the higher chambers produced the better pieces, as they heated up more slowly. As one example, the wide range of colours seen in Chinese celadon wares such as Yue ware and Longquan celadon is largely explained by variations in firing conditions. Variations in the shades of white porcelains between and within the northern Ding ware and the southern Qingbai were also the result of the fuel used. Some of the most advanced <b>chambered</b> <b>kilns</b> were built to fire Dehua porcelain, where precise control of high temperatures was essential. The dragon kiln form was copied in Korea, from sometime between 100 and 300 CE, and much later in Japan in various types of climbing anagama kilns, and elsewhere in East Asia.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} has been to measure the sound power level of the {{propulsion}} noise from a heavy vehicle at constant speed. The measurement results have been compared with the Harmonoise/Imagine source model for heavy vehicles. The model {{will be used for}} noise mapping purposes. The influence of driving style, vehicle load and road gradient was also studied. Finally a city cycle test, including different driving modes; acceleration, constant speed, engine braking and low idle, was performed. The work has been performed indoors at the Noise and Vibration Laboratory at Volvo Trucks, Göteborg. Partly in the powertrain rig where the truck cab, with standard noise muffler and noise shields, was built up around the driveline, and partly in the <b>truck</b> noise <b>chamber</b> where the rear tires where encapsulated. The sound power level in third octave bands was measured according to ISO 3744 using a parallelepiped measurement surface. The tested vehicle is a typical long distance truck with a 480 hp engine. The simulated load was 30 tonnes and 18 tonnes for the powertrain rig and the <b>truck</b> noise <b>chamber</b> respectively. The results indicate that the vehicle speed dependent source model shows too high values at higher speeds. The measurements show also that the propulsion noise at constant speed can be modelled as constant below 50 km/h. The sound level increases above 50 - 55 km/h with the increased engine speed. A rougher driving style defined as driving with one gear lower than most suitable gear, leads to an averaged noise increase of 2, 3 dBA in the powertrain rig and 1, 4 dBA in the <b>truck</b> <b>chamber.</b> Simulating different vehicle load at horizontal road and with constant speed showed no influence on the emitted noise. Driving on positive and negative road grades in these measurements showed approximately the same noise increase in both up- and downhills due to increased engine load.

40|$|An {{improper}} {{air circulation}} within the refrigerated <b>truck</b> <b>chambers</b> {{is the major}} cause of inadequate road transport of perishable products under controlled temperature. In this study, two methods were developed, one experimental and another computational, for modelling of non-isothermal turbulent flows in refrigerated chambers, both of natural convection and of forced convection.

A two equation turbulence model was used to model the effect of turbulence. The experimental validation was accomplished through confrontation of the numerical predictions with measures obtained in a reduced-scale model. The good agreement obtained suggests a good accuracy for engineering purposes.

In theory the maximum efficiency would be achieved if all the fuel were burned in the preheater, but the sintering operation involves partial melting and nodulization to make clinker, and the rolling action of the rotary kiln remains {{the most efficient way}} of doing this.

A diameter of 6 m appears to be the limit of size of rotary kilns, because the flexibility of the steel shell becomes unmanageable at or above this size, and the firebrick lining tends to fail when the kiln flexes.|$|R
