5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> rear axle to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. <b>Tow</b> <b>vehicles</b> often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R
50|$|The current {{controlling}} the brakes from the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is {{originating in the}} battery/alternator of the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> via the brake controller and then transferred via wiring through the electric brake pin in the trailer connector through the trailer wiring to the electromagnet and back through the trailer wiring to the trailer connector and to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> chassis/frame through the ground pin in the trailer connector.|$|R

50|$|Hitch tow {{trucks are}} mostly sized for cars and light duty trucks. Larger versions, with a long, {{weighted}} body and heavier duty engines, transmissions, and tow hooks, {{may be used}} for towing of disabled buses, truck tractors, or large trucks.

50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle's</b> hitch.

50|$|A {{full trailer}} {{is a term}} used in the United States for a freight trailer {{supported}} by front and rear axles and pulled by a drawbar.

A full trailer is 96 or 102 in wide and 35 or 40 ft long.As per AIS 053, full trailer is a <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle</b> having at least two axles, and equipped with a towing device which can move vertically in relation to the trailer and controls the direction of the front axle(s), but which transmits no significant static load to the towing vehicle.|$|E

The innovative, combined system measures nitrate concentration at high spatial resolution (4 m vertically, 5 km horizontally), high sensitivity (0. 2 ?M), and concomitantly with temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. The authors demonstrate that this approach constitutes a powerful new tool for quantifying the role of mesoscale and submesoscale vertical nutrient fluxes to the euphotic zone, using measurements from a high-resolution survey of an eddy dipole in the Iceland Basin {{during the summer of}} 2007...|$|E

The development of an autopilot for stability augmentation and maneuvering of the <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle</b> is discussed. An overview of the implementation of the models in a digital computer simulation program is provided, and some typical results obtained using the program are presented. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results is also made...|$|E
40|$|A compact {{multi-frequency}} sonar operating over 250 kHz to 2 MHz {{has been}} developed that fits to a towed undulating vehicle. This combined the ability of high-frequency acoustics to sample distributions of zooplankton size ranges 1 cm with the surface to 500 m depth coverage of a <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The transducer array incorporated seven broad-band elements, with novel features to increase bandwidth and reduce extra attenuation. A minimum of circuitry {{was placed in the}} underwater unit, all of the signal processing taking place using commercial off-the-shelf hardware onboard the ship.

50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{eliminated}} by minimising slack spring travel, and by {{reducing the amount of}} trailer braking force applied for a given drawbar force. However this results in the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> bearing some of the trailer braking load, something the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is often not designed to do. The result is compromised braking.|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{surveys of}} Ramsey Lake, Sudbury, Ontario water quality were {{conducted}} using an innovative underwater <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UTV) {{equipped with a}} multi-parameter probe providing real-time water quality data. The UTV revealed underwater vent sites through high resolution monitoring of different spatial chemical characteristics using common sensors (turbidity, chloride, dissolved oxygen, and oxidation/reduction sensors) {{that would not be}} feasible with traditional water sampling methods. Multi-parameter probe vent site identification is supported by elevated alkalinity and silica concentrations at these sites. The identified groundwater vent sites appear to be controlled by bedrock fractures that transport water from different sources with different contaminants of concern. Elevated contaminants, such as, arsenic and nickel and/or nutrient concentrations are evident at the vent sites, illustrating the potential of these sources to degrade water quality. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the classification of seabed type from a video cap-tured by a camera mounted on a <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle</b> that is dragged along the sea floor. Classifi-cation of seabed type {{is important for the}} mapping of marine habitats. Unlike other meth-ods that are based on various sonar technologies, the proposed method is based purely on video frames. The aim is to tell from a single frame, what seabed type is present. A supervised learning approach is adopted, with a total of 5 different seabed types being represented. We developed a set of 6 image features to characterise the visual appearances of these seabed types. Both k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are implemented based on this feature set. Our analysis shows that is possible to achieve a cross-validation error of 10 % for the 5 -class problem...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarise}} the photo-physiological responses of phytoplankton to upwelling of macronutrients in mesoscale eddies in the subtropical North Atlantic (EDDIES project, Sargasso Sea) and subtropical North Pacific (E-FLUX project, Hawaii). The observations, obtained on {{two sets of}} cruises over 2 years, occupied six cyclonic eddies and two mode-water eddies. The photosynthetic physiological parameters were measured using a bench-top fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) system and a submersible in situ fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRF) deployed on an undulating <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Both of these instruments were used to provide highly sensitive and well-resolved data on community responses. The responses are dependent on both the type of eddy and its stage of development. Our results indicate that, while cyclonic eddies in the Atlantic and Pacific can increase primary photosynthetic production early in their development, mode-water eddies in the subtropical North Atlantic can support patchy blooms of large diatoms {{for long periods of}} time (more than 3 months) ...|$|E
