In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} against the Gepids, Alboin {{had failed to}} greatly {{increase}} his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, {{even though there are}} indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called Plague of Justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the Three-Chapter Controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, Narses, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including Heruli, Suebi, Gepids, Thuringii, Bulgars, Sarmatians, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the Saxons, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King Sigebert, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.|$|E

Surprised Russians garrisoned at Åbo however reacted quickly and deployed over 3,000 men to stop the landing force. By the morning of 20 June the Swedish forces were forced to withdraw. Swedish forces also performed landings near Vasa but with similar results.

He {{also serves as a}} vice-president of BTCV, vice-president of Fauna and Flora International, president of Butterfly Conservation and president of Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. In 2003, he launched an appeal on behalf of the World Land Trust to create a rainforest reserve in Ecuador in memory of Christopher Parsons, the producer of Life on Earth and a personal friend, who had died the previous year. The same year, he helped to launch ARKive, a global project instigated by Parsons <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> natural history media into a digital library. ARKive is an initiative of Wildscreen, of which Attenborough is a patron. He later became patron of the World Land Trust, and an active supporter. He supported Glyndebourne in their successful application to obtain planning permission for a wind turbine in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and gave evidence at the planning inquiry arguing in favour of the proposal.|$|E

Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class serve to make the book {{more than a simple}} travel narrative.

500|$|The {{book came}} about through the {{activities}} of scientists at the Royal Society of London. Franklin sent letters {{to members of the}} Society about his experiments on electricity and the observations he had made. Most of these letters went to Peter Collinson. Some of these were read at the society's meetings. There was much interest shown, so some of them were sent to a printer to be published in a magazine. Public interest in Franklin's letters about electricity led the Society <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> many of the letters to Collinson from Franklin over a two-year period and send them to the printer for publication. This first collection of letters was published in a ninety-page pamphlet in 1751. It was soon followed by other parts that were [...] "Supplemental" [...] to the existing edition and eventually a [...] "New" [...] publication was sold from the total of all the [...] "Parts" [...] produced. Each edition expanded by additional Franklin letters being added. It ultimately became a 496-page volume by 1769. The book inspired others to follow in Franklin's footsteps to do further in-depth research on electricity.|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{sued the}} FBI, whose National Gang Intelligence Center listed Juggalos as [...] "a loosely {{organized}} hybrid gang" [...] in a 2011 report. The report states that Juggalos are [...] "recognized as a gang in only four states... {{law enforcement officials}} in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets". The report also noted that New Mexico was {{seeing a lot of}} Juggalo gang expansion due to their attraction to [...] "the tribal and cultural traditions of the Native Americans". The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had [...] "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order [...] "to ensure the right of Juggalos everywhere <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> and express their support of the I.C.P. without having to worry about being unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement". On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any [...] "criminal intelligence information" [...] about Juggalos destroyed. ICP announced in the edition of December 21, 2012 of the Hatchet Herald that they will be releasing a sideshow EP to The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. After no word was heard on the album, it was speculated that it had been scrapped. In mid 2013 it was announced that ICP would be releasing their first ever box set titled The First Six. After the release date came and passed, The First Six was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked if {{we would be able to}} get the box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put House of Wax in the box set instead. The First Six was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.|$|E
