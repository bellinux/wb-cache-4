40|$|International audienceBackground: <b>Topical</b> local <b>anaesthesia</b> of {{the airway}} of anaesthetised {{children}} has many potential benefits. In our institution, lignocaine is topically instilled {{into the back}} of the mouth with the expectation that it will come into contact with the larynx. The volume and method of application varies between clinicians. There is no published evidence to support the plausibility of this technique. Aim: To determine whether this technique of instillation results in the local anaesthetic coming into contact with key laryngeal structures and whether this is influenced by volume or additional physical manoeuvres. Methods/Materials: Sixty three healthy anaesthetised children between six months and 16 years old had lignocaine stained with methylene blue poured {{into the back of}} their mouths. The volume and subsequent physical manoeuvre were determined by randomisation. A blinded observer assessed staining of the vocal cords, epiglottis, vallecula and piriform fossae by direct laryngoscopy. Airway complications were recorded. Results: Fifty three of the 63 children had complete staining of all four areas. Four children had one area unstained and all others had at least partial staining of all four structures. Nine children coughed following induction of anaesthesia. Coughing was more likely in children with incomplete staining (p= 0. 03), low volume lignocaine (p= 0. 003) and following a head lift (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: Oral administration of lignocaine without use of a laryngoscope frequently results in widespread coverage of key laryngeal structures and may reduce the risk of coughing...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{report the}} {{successful}} management {{of a culture}} positive case of APE, {{without the need for}} hospital admission and discuss the merits of this strategy. CASE: A 79 -year-old lady underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery in her left eye using phacoemulsification under <b>topical</b> and intracameral <b>anaesthesia.</b> She reported to eye casualty four days later, with pain and vision reduced to 6 / 60 in the left eye. A diagnosis of acute postoperative endophthalmitis was made. A vitreous biopsy was performed and antibiotics injected intravitreally on the same day. The patient was discharged on oral and topical antibiotics on the same day and reviewed subsequently in the clinic as an outpatient. Vision steadily improved and at one month following intravitreal injection her vision had improved to 6 / 9 unaided. The cornea remained clear, with a quiet anterior chamber and {{a clear view of the}} fundus. DISCUSSION: Current management of acute postoperative endophthalmitis in the UK includes a vitreous biopsy, administration of antibiotics into the vitreous cavity, admission of patients to a hospital ward and daily review. It is our opinion that under the circumstances where patients are fit and well, without significant co-morbidity, hospital admission is not necessary as demonstrated by the patient in our report...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{surgical}} {{stress index}} (SSI), {{derived from a}} combination of heart rate (HR) and photoplethysmographic amplitude (PPGA) time series, is a novel method for continuous monitoring of intraoperative stress and has been validated in adults. The applicability of SSI and its constituents to monitoring children has not been previously evaluated. Methods. In this controlled trial, 22 anaesthetized patients, aged 4 – 17 yr, undergoing strabis-mus surgery were randomized into two groups, Group LL and Group BSS. Patients in Group LL received <b>topical</b> conjunctival <b>anaesthesia</b> with a 1 : 1 mixture of lidocaine 2 % and levobupiva-caine 0. 75 %, and patients in Group BSS received balanced salt solution. Results. Endotracheal intubation (n 22) increased median (range) SSI from 39. 2 (22. 6 – 55. 6) to 53. 6 (35. 8 – 63. 3) (P, 0. 001), decreased PPGA from 5. 62 (2. 79 – 9. 69) to 5. 27 (2. 59 – 7. 54) % (P 0. 001), and increased the difference of response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) of frontal biopotentials (RE 2 SE) from 3. 1 (0. 06 – 9. 1) to 5. 7 (0. 6 – 9. 4) (P 0. 01). Conventional haemodynamic variables also increased, median (range) HR from 72. 9 (56. 7 – 113. 8) to 84. 2 (60. 4 – 124. 8) beats min 21 (P, 0. 001), and systolic non-invasive arterial pressure (S-NIBP) from 87 (78 – 143) to 103 (79 – 125) (P 0. 007). When 3 min baseline before surgery was compared with 12 min of surgery, median (range) SSI increased from 43. 3 (31. 2 – 58. 0) to 49. 9 (39. 3 – 57. 2) (P 0. 042) vs from 46. 6 (26. 8 – 57. 8) to 52. 1 (31. 7 – 60. 1) (P 0. 024) and PPGA decreased from 6. 60 (3. 10 – 8. 24) to 5. 80 (3. 03 – 7. 65) % (P, 0. 001) vs from 5. 51 (3. 25 – 9. 84) to 5. 06 (3. 08 – 8. 99) % (P 0. 042), in Groups LL and BSS, respectively, but SSI or other indicators did not differ significantly between the groups...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the incidence, features, management, and {{risk factors of}} post-intravitreal anti-VEGF endophthalmitis (PIAE) in patients undergoing treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration in the United Kingdom. Prospective observational case control study. Forty-seven cases of PIAE were identified through the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit from January 2009 to March 2010. Data collected at diagnosis and at 6 months follow-up included patient demographics, intravitreal injection details, pre- and post-injection management, visual acuity, clinical features and management of PIAE, causative organisms, and clinical outcomes. Details were compared with 200 control cases from 10 control centres to identify potential risk factors. Estimated PIAE was 0. 025 %. Culture-positive PIAE incidence was 0. 015 %. Mean age of presentation was 78 years. Mean number of intravitreal injections before PIAE was 5. Mean days to presentation was 5 (range 1 - 39). Positive microbiology culture was found in 59. 6 %. The majority of causative organisms were Gram positive (92. 8 %). Significant risk factors were failure to administer topical antibiotics immediately after the injection (P= 0. 001), blepharitis (P= 0. 006), subconjunctival anaesthesia (P= 0. 021), patient squeezing during the injection (P= 0. 021), and failure to administer topical antibiotics before anti-VEGF injection (P= 0. 05).

Methods: In a randomised controlled trial, 18 consecutive adult patients with DES requiring punctal occlusion were recruited over a 10 month period. Consenting patients were randomised into two groups. Group A patients received pressure <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in the right eye followed by injection anaesthesia in the left eye. Group B was vice versa. Punctal occlusion using cautery was performed in each eye after a specified time following the application of anaesthesia. The main outcome measures were the pain experienced during application of anaesthesia and that during punctal occlusion. Results: 36 eyes of 18 patients were randomised to receive injection anaesthesia in one eye and pressure <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in the other. Nine patients (nine females) were in group A and nine patients (seven females, two males) in group B. The mean age of group A patients was 45. 3 (SD 13. 5) years, and that of group B patients was 55. 6 (12. 6) years. The two groups were comparable in terms of mean age (p = 0. 117) and mean pain score for pressure <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> application (p = 0. 612), injection anaesthesia application (p = 0. 454), diathermy in pressure anaesthetised eyes (p = 0. 113), and diathermy in injection anaesthetised eyes (p = 0. 289). Paired t test was used to compare the mean pain score for pressure <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> application (16. 8 (24. 8)) with those for injection anaesthesia application (56. 7 (30. 0)). 18 eyes of 18 patients were compared with the fellow eye of the same 18 patients. The mean pain score for injection anaesthesia was greater than for pressure <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> application (p< 0. 0001) (statistical power = 0. 87). No statistically significant difference was found in the mean pain score for diathermy for eyes that received pressure <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (20. 5 (27. 5)) compared with eyes that received injection anaesthesia (23. 1 (26. 3)) (p = 0. 760) (statistical power = 0. 96).

40|$|The {{manifestation of}} {{psoriasis}} represents {{an interaction between}} a genetically predisposed individual and environmental influences such as infections, trauma, stress, endocrine factors, sunlight and drugs. The cutaneous lesions are characterised by marked epidermal proliferation, complex alterations in epidermal differentiation, multiple biochemical, immunological, in-flammatory and vascular abnormalities and a poorly understood relationship with the central and peripheral nervous system function. Hypothesis: Multiple observations are compatible with {{the existence of a}} peptidergic neurogenic mechanism in the pathophysiology of psoriatic plaque. Our hypothesis was that afferent noci-ceptive nerve-fibre endings in lesional skin are sensitised and activated by an unknown mediator. Via an axon-reflex mechanism in afferent C and A-delta fibre-endings, these nerves release neuro-peptides, which themselves have dilating effects and, in addition, may induce mast-cell degranulation/histamine release causing further vasodilatation. A pathological axon-reflex mechanism may thus contribute to the high blood flow and stimulate histamine release in lesional psoriatic skin. To test this hypothesis, a series of functional studies has been conducted to elucidate whether local neurogenic peptidergic mechanisms are of importance for the maintenance of the increase in blood flow and whether such mechanisms may induce histamine release in psoriatic plaque. Methods: Healthy subjects and patients with untreated psoriatic lesions were examined. The micro-dialysis technique was evaluated for application in dermal skin through measurements of tissue perturbations induced by the microdialysis catheter. A new calibration technique, retro-dialysis calibration, was tested and used to evaluate the concentration and release of histamine in lesional and non-lesional skin before and during the local stimulation and inhibition of noci-ceptive afferent nerves. The short term application of topical capsaicin was used to excite such neurones. Long-term treatment with capsaicin which desensitises nociceptive fibres or local anaesthesia was used to inhibit the activity. A laser Doppler technique was used to measure changes in perfusion before and after the provocations and 133 Xenon clearance methodology was used to estimate skin blood flow. Results: Perfusion, blood flow, histamine concentration and histamine release increased in lesional skin as compared with non-lesional tissue. The inhibition of nervous activity by <b>topical</b> local <b>anaesthesia</b> decreased the perfusion and augmented the concentration of histamine, but did not change the histamine release in lesional skin. No changes in these parameters were found in non-lesional skin. The stimulation of C-fibres by short-term capsaicin treatment increased the per-fusion and the concentration and release of histamine in both lesional and non-lesional skin. Long-term capsaicin treatment reduced the perfusion in lesional skin and increased it in lesion-free skin. Conclusion: The results are compatible with the hypothesis that a pathological axon reflex may contribute to the high blood flow in lesional psoriatic skin. In contrast, the increase in histamine release, is mediated either not at all or only to a minor extent by neurogenic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{disease is}} common in adults and in adolescents. It {{particularly}} affects the knee joints. In young people, joint disease {{has a number of}} causes including: genetic factors, defects in joint cartilage and sports related injuries. In particular, overtraining and traumatic injuries are common in many sports Participation in sports has expanded during the last two decades {{in many parts of the}} world. This has led to an increased number of injuries. Our knowledge of the role of ligaments in the control of movements and how they should be managed after injuries needs to expand as fast as participation rates. The aims of the current study were firstly, to investigate if reflexes can be elicited by electrical stimulation of ligaments. Secondly, to investigate if different muscles are affected differently by these reflexes. The final aim was to investigate if these reflexes can be modulated by posture or muscle activity. A total of 44 volunteers participated in a series of experiments. These experiments were designed to elicit reflexes following electrical stimulation of the collateral knee ligaments during sitting, standing and walking on treadmill. The reflexes were observed in averaged rectified electromyograms from Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Lateralis, Lateral and Medial Gastrocnemius and Soleus. Muscle activity was essential if reflexes were to be elicited. No reflexes were elicited in relaxed muscles. During the first series of experiments reflexes in Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis and Vastus Medialis were investigated while the Reflexes were identified as changes in the averaged rectified electromyograms (EMG). The EMG in the immediate post stimulus period was compared with the pre-stimulus control. Inhibitory and excitatory reflexes were elicited following ligament stimulation in all three sets of experiments. The mean latency in quadriceps for early excitation was 57 +/- 6 msec and 67 +/- 10 msec for early inhibitions. The equivalent means were 70 +/- 6 msec and 77 +/- 6 msec for triceps. The shortest latency recorded in quadriceps was 46 msec. Longer latency reflexes were frequently observed. The mean latency in quadriceps for late excitation was 102 +/- 6 msec and 113 +/- 11 msec for late inhibitions. The equivalent means were 110 +/- 6 msec and 119 +/- 11 msec for triceps. There was no significant difference in the latencies of reflexes from MCL and LCL. The latencies in triceps were approximately 10 msec longer (90 msec for quadriceps a 100 msec for triceps) than those in quadriceps and this can be attributed to their longer conduction pathway. The reflexes were also recorded during gait. During walking, the latencies of both excitations and inhibitions were significantly longer than they were during sitting and standing. The mean latency of excitatory reflexes in Vastus Lateralis after LCL stimulation were 71 +/- 5 msec. For inhibitory reflexes the mean latency was 87 +/- 1 msec. The mean latency for excitation reflexes in Lateral Gastrocnemus was 82 +/- 2 msec and for inhibition reflexes was 94 +/- 3 msec. In each set of experiments the shortest latencies were consistent with slow group II or group III afferents excited by relatively strong stimulation. Control experiments using <b>topical</b> cutaneous <b>anaesthesia</b> minimised the possibility of cutaneous contributions to the observed reflexes. It is also possible that the electrical stimulation excited capsular afferents located close to the ligaments. This cannot be settled by the experiment reported in this thesis and the observed reflexes are best described as ligamento-muscular reflexes. These observed effects are consistent with recent results already published by Kim et al in 1995. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether topical lidocaine benefits esophagogastroduoduenoscopy (EGD) by decreasing propofol dose necessary for sedation or procedure-related complications. METHODS: The {{study was designed}} as a prospective, single centre, double blind, randomised clinical trial and was conducted in 2012 between January and May (NCT 01489891). Consecutive patients undergoing EGD were randomly assigned to receive supplemental topical lidocaine (L; 50 mg in an excipient solution which was applied as a spray to the oropharynx) or placebo (P; taste excipients solution without active substance, similarly delivered) prior to the standard propofol sedation procedure. The propofol was administered as a bolus intravenous (iv) dose, with patients in the L and P groups receiving initial doses based on the patient&#x 2019;s American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) classification (ASA&#x 2005;I-II: 0. 50 - 0. 60 mg/kg; ASA III-IV: 0. 25 - 0. 35 mg/kg), followed by 10 - 20 mg iv dose every 30 - 60 s at the anaesthetist&#x 2019;s discretion. Vital signs, anthropometric measurements, amount of propofol administered, sedation level reached, examination time, and the subjective assessments of the endoscopist&#x 2019;s and anaesthetist&#x 2019;s satisfaction (based upon a four point Likert scale) were recorded. All statistical tests were performed by the Stata statistical software suite (Release 11, 2009; StataCorp, LP, College Station, TX, United States). RESULTS: No {{significant differences were found between}} the groups treated with lidocaine or placebo in terms of total propofol dose (310. 7 1; 139. 2 mg/kg per minute vs 280. 1 1; 87. 7 mg/kg per minute, P = 0. 15) or intraprocedural propofol dose (135. 3 1; 151. 7 mg/kg per minute vs 122. 7 1; 96. 5 mg/kg per minute, P = 0. 58). Only when the L and P groups were analysed with the particular subgroups of female, < 65 -year-old, and lower anaesthetic risk level (ASA&#x 2005;I-II) was a statistically significant difference found (L: 336. 5 1; 141. 2 mg/kg per minute vs P: 284. 6 1; 91. 2 mg/kg per minute, P = 0. 03) for greater total propofol requirements). The total incidence of complications was also similar between the two groups, with the L group showing a complication rate of 32. 2 % (95 %CI: 21. 6 - 45. 0) and the P group showing a complication rate of 26. 7 % (95 %CI: 17. 0 - 39. 0). In addition, the use of lidocaine had no effect on the anaesthetist&#x 2019;s or endoscopist&#x 2019;s satisfaction with the procedure. Thus, the endoscopist&#x 2019;s satisfaction Likert assessments were equally distributed among the L and P groups: unsatisfactory, [L: 6. 8 % (95 %CI: 2. 2 - 15. 5) vs P: 0 % (95 %CI: 0 - 4. 8); neutral, L: 10. 1 % (95 %CI: 4. 2 - 19. 9) vs P: 15 % (95 %CI: 7. 6 - 25. 7) ]; satisfactory, [L: 25. 4 % (95 %CI: 10 - 29. 6) vs P: 18. 3 % (95 %CI: 15. 5 - 37. 6); and very satisfactory, L: 57. 6 % (95 %CI: 54 - 77. 7) vs P: 66. 6 % (95 %CI: 44. 8 - 69. 7) ]. Likewise, the anaesthetist&#x 2019;s satisfaction Likert assessments regarding the ease of maintaining a patient at an optimum sedation level without agitation or modification of the projected sedation protocol were not affected by the application of lidocaine, as evidenced by the lack of significant differences between the scores for the placebo group: unsatisfactory, L: 5. 8 % (95 %CI: 1. 3 - 13. 2) vs P: 0 % (95 %CI: 0 - 4. 8); neutral, L: 16. 9 % (95 %CI: 8. 9 - 28. 4) vs P: 16. 7 % (95 %CI: 8. 8 - 27. 7); satisfactory, L: 15. 2 % (95 %CI: 7. 7 - 26. 1) vs P: 20. 3 % (95 %CI: 11. 3 - 31. 6); and very satisfactory, L: 62. 7 % (95 %CI: 49. 9 - 74. 3) vs P: 63. 3 % (95 %CI: 50. 6 - 74. 7).

Patient comfort assessed objectively by the anaesthetic assistant during the procedure, ease of intubation assessed using cough and gag reflex score, time taken to intubate and the haemodynamic changes during the procedure were compared. Results: Ease of intubation, patient comfort and the time taken to intubate were significantly better in Group T patients, with P = 0. 001, 0. 009 and 0. 019, respectively, compared with the patients in Group A. There were no significant changes in haemodynamic parameters. Conclusion: <b>Topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> by transtracheal injection in patients with anticipated difficult airway made AFOI easier and faster with better patient comfort compared to atomiser with no clinically significant untoward side effects...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Visual {{awareness}} during phacoemulsification cataract {{surgery is}} an important determinant of patient satisfaction with any anaesthetic technique. <b>Topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> could be associated with significant visual awareness {{because it does not}} affect optic nerve function.  METHODS—The visual experience during phacoemulsification cataract surgery under <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (without sedation) was assessed for 106  consecutive unselected patients. Patients were interviewed immediately after surgery using a standardised questionnaire that explored specific aspects of their visual experience.  RESULTS—Four patients were excluded because they had poor recollection of their visual experience. The visual awareness of the remaining 102  patients comprised operating microscope light (99), colours (73), flashes of light (7), vague movements (19), surgical instruments or other objects (12), change in light brightness during surgery (49), change in colours during surgery (30), and transient visual alteration during corneal irrigation (25). No patient found their visual experience during surgery unpleasant, though the operating microscope light was uncomfortably bright for two patients. Six patients lost light perception for a short interval during surgery. There was no association between the various visual phenomena reported and patients' age, sex, preoperative visual acuity, cataract morphology, coexisting ocular pathology, or previous experience of cataract surgery under local anaesthesia (p> 0. 05).  CONCLUSIONS—Patients experience a wide variety of visual sensations during phacoemulsification cataract surgery under <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> <b>Topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> does not, however, appear to result in greater visual awareness than regional anaesthesia. Preoperative patient counselling should include information about the visual experience during surgery. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Laser {{treatment}} for {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (ROP) {{may be associated with}} systemic stress for the infant. No national consensus on the optimum method of anaesthesia for the treatment of ROP currently exists. This study ascertains the anaesthetic practices employed for the treatment of ROP by ophthalmologists in the United Kingdom (UK), and also their attitudes towards these practices. Materials and methods A postal questionnaire was sent to 46 consultant ophthalmologists identified as performing {{treatment for}} ROP in the UK. The consultants were asked to estimate the annual number of babies with ROP that they treated with laser, what methods of anaesthesia they employed, for comments regarding the arrangements for, and types of anaesthesia employed and whether they believed that the neonatal stress response to laser treatment was associated with a significant risk of systemic complications. Results In all, 35 (76 %) questionnaires were returned. A total of 30 (86 %) respondents reported performing laser treatment for ROP. Of these, 15 (50 %) used general anaesthesia for all cases and 11 (37 %) intravenous sedation combined with <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for all cases. Oral sedation combined with <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> rectal chloral hydrate and paracetamol combined with <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> intravenous ketamine combined with <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> and subtenon's local anesthesia were used by one (3 %) respondent each. There were no ophthalmologists using subconjunctival or topical anaesthetic alone or treating without anaesthesia. Conclusion This survey reveals considerable variation in practice among UK ophthalmologists regarding the anaesthetic methods employed in the treatment of ROP, and their beliefs regarding the systemic stress associated with treatment...|$|E
40|$|A 73 {{year old}} man {{developed}} chest pains 5 minutes after fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

40|$|AIM—To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} an intraoperative intracameral injection of mepivacaine, administered when patients experienced pain {{during the course of}} cataract surgery under <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b>  METHODS—This is a prospective placebo controlled double masked randomised clinical trial. 50  eyes were included; 25  receiving the active compound and 25  receiving placebo. Mepivacaine (2 %, 0. 4  ml) or placebo was administered intraoperatively under the iris of the patients who experienced pain during the course of phacoemulsification in spite of previous <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Efficacy was evaluated by the patients themselves using a five point subjective pain rating scale, the Keele verbal pain chart. Safety was measured by assessing intraocular inflammation (clinical evaluation and laser flare meter), intraocular pressure, and endothelial cell count.  RESULTS—The pain rating score significantly diminished after intracameral injection in the mepivacaine group (mean 3. 0  (95 % CI 2. 6 - 3. 4) v 0. 8  (0. 3 - 1. 3), p< 10 − 4)) while remaining unchanged in the placebo group (2. 9  (2. 6 - 3. 2) v 2. 9  (2. 5 - 3. 3)), the mean reduction in pain score being significantly different between the two groups (p< 10 − 4). There was no indication of increased postoperative ocular inflammation, intraocular pressure change, or endothelial cell loss.  CONCLUSIONS—These results suggest that it may not be necessary to systematically add intracameral anaesthesia with <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for cataract surgery. An intraoperative intracameral injection, performed only in patients who happen to suffer during surgery, is safe and effective. ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Patient and surgeon {{satisfaction}} with topical versus peribulbar anaesthesia {{have been documented}} by various studies {{and has been a}} conflicting argument. In this study, we assessed in terms of patient’s pain and surgeon satisfaction using these two anaesthetic techniques for better outcome of cataract surgeries. AIM To evaluate efficacy in terms of pain, visual outcome and surgeon {{satisfaction with}} <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> versus peribulbar anaesthesia in Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS). MATERIALS & METHODS A prospective clinical study was conducted at Government Medical College (GMC) Jammu from November 2010 to October 2011. A total of 300 patients underwent SICS with 150 patients in each group receiving topical & peribulbar anaesthesia respectively. Patient’s pain during application of anaesthesia and during surgery were assessed by visual analogue pain scale. Surgeon satisfaction in terms of intraoperative difficulty was evaluated. The student’s t-test and chi square test was used to determine IOWA score in both groups. p ˂ 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS Feeling of pain during the administration of <b>topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was significantly lower as compared to peribulbar anaesthesia (p ˂ 0. 005). While there is not much difference in pain during surgery in both the groups (p= 0. 026, not significant). Regarding visual acuity, there is significant {{difference between the two groups}} on I st postoperative day (p= 0. 005), while there was no difference between the two groups at the 6 th week (p= 0. 85). There was no significant intraoperative difficulty encountered by the surgeon in both the groups. CONCLUSION <b>Topical</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is preferable to peribulbar anaesthesia and is recommended as a safe and effective alternative to peribulbar anaesthesia for cataract surgery...|$|E
