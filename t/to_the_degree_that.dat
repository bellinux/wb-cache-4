5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E
5|$|The British army {{encountered}} {{an extremely}} hostile population, prepared to resist <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> even women, children and slaves voluntarily {{participated in the}} defense. The headquarters of the Regiment of Patricians were located at the Real Colegio de San Carlos, where Saavedra and Juan José Viamonte stopped the column of Denis Pack and Henry Cadogan, composed of British infantry and a cannon. Pack united his remaining forces with Craufurd and resisted inside the Santo Domingo convent. Cadogan took the nearby house of Pedro Medrano, and fired from the rooftop. Both groups were finally defeated by the local soldiers. Finally, the British General John Whitelocke surrendered, ending the attack and pledging to withdraw all British forces from Montevideo.|$|E

The bands' manager, Joyce Smyth, and Concerts Westworked extensively with the Cuban government {{in order for the}} show to be approved, due to the Cuban government still having control over what its citizens listen to.

5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because {{they are not as}} readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, after Nikita Khrushchev's ouster, a plenum of the Central Committee (CC) forbade {{any single}} {{individual}} {{to hold the}} two most powerful posts of the country (the office of the General Secretary and the premier), and Kosygin {{was in charge of}} economic administration in his role as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However Kosygin's position was weakened when he proposed an economic reform in 1965. Under the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government of the USSR. The premier was the chief of the executive branch and head of the union government as a whole, the premiership was the highest governmental office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition until the establishment of the Presidency in 1990. The premier was responsible and accountable to the Supreme Soviet, and in the period between sessions of the Supreme Soviet, accountable to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The premier was tasked with resolving all state administrative duties within the jurisdiction of the USSR <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> it did not come under the competence of the Supreme Soviet or the Presidium. The premier managed the national economy, formulated the five-year plans and ensured socio-cultural development.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, Ronald Langacker's {{cognitive}} grammar {{framework is}} described as a type of construction grammar.

Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like part-of-speech classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.|$|E

25|$|Feudalism {{never really}} {{developed}} in Norway or Sweden, {{as it did}} in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The Hanseatic League forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> no real burgher class existed in Norway.|$|E
25|$|The Viagens {{series is}} notable in the {{development}} of American science fiction of the 1950s for bringing a more realistic attitude to bear on some of the less credible features then commonplace to the genre, reimagining them in terms of the possible. It also leavened the hero-worship, sexism, prudery, ethnocentricity and nationalism then characteristic of the genre with a more skeptical view of human nature, strong characters of both genders (and of both same-sex and opposite-sex inclinations, though the latter predominate), for whom sex was a normal aspect of life, and an ethnically varied, international cast. De Camp's work helped prepare the field for the works of later, more iconoclastic writers, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> {{when he returned to the}} series in the 1970s his own innovations had themselves come to appear routine and commonplace.|$|E
25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder usually develops in adolescence or during early adulthood. It {{is not uncommon}} for children and adolescents to display some traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences usually are transient, and do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD. True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>that</b> significantly impairs the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important social settings.
