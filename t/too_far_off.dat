A DVD release, containing studio {{footage of the}} group recording their debut album, was planned, but ultimately never released, in 2007. Patrick, shortly before the first album, anticipated that a second album would not be <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off.</b> Dean DeLeo would also say that he wanted listeners to wait and judge the band's songs once the band had released their fifth record.|$|E
25|$|In 1148, the Second Crusade {{arrived in}} Syria, led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Nur ad-Din's {{victories}} and the crusaders' losses in Asia Minor however {{had made the}} recovery of Edessa – their original goal – practically impossible. Given that Aleppo was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> from Jerusalem for an attack and Damascus, recently allied with the Kingdom of Jerusalem against Zengi, had entered into an alliance with Nur ad-Din, the crusaders decided to attack Damascus, the conquest of which would preclude a combination of Jerusalem's enemies. Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly called for help from Nur ad-Din, but the crusader siege collapsed after only four days.|$|E
25|$|Hatteras, {{as part of}} the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, {{patrolled the}} coast {{as part of the}} fleet under the command of Commodore Henry H. Bell. On the {{afternoon}} of 11 January 1863, she was ordered to sail to the south-east. After one and a half hours a ship was seen. Blake approached and soon identified her as the Confederate raider CSS Alabama, then under the command Raphael Semmes. Blake knew {{that the rest of the}} fleet were <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> to render any assistance and that his own ship was outgunned (Alabama was armed with six 32-pounders, one 110-pounder, and one 68-pounder). Despite this Blake ordered his vessel to clear for action, hoping to capture the Alabama by boarding, or to disable her for long enough for the rest of the fleet to arrive.|$|E

25|$|Murat then {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} with reinforcements, deploying his two battalions of light infantry, and assuming personal command of Saint-Germain's cuirassier division. With the cuirassiers successfully countercharging and repulsing a Russian Dragoon regiment that had come up to attack {{the right wing of}} the French forces, Murat realised that he was in a dangerous position and sent word to General Delzons to hasten his march towards the field of battle. Several attacks ensued, with the French committing Jacquinot's cavalry brigade and the infantry, but with the Russians holding ground. Realising his numeric superiority, the Russian commander, General Ostermann-Tolstoy, launched an attack against both French wings, in an attempt to catch them in double envelopment. However, with the arrival of a fresh French division, Delzon's 13th division, the Russian commander decided to call off his attack and pull back. Murat opted against a pursuit, given his inferior forces and knowing that Broussier's division was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> behind Delzons to be counted on.|$|E
25|$|Austrian {{commander}} Klenau, with {{an initial}} force of 18,000 men and 64 cannons had orders to delay the French pursuit. On 9 July, Klenau decided to make another stand, this time near Hollabrunn, around 55 kilometers northwest of Vienna. Following the initial skirmishes, Klenau's force was still 17,000 men strong and it now occupied a strong position. Opposite to him, Masséna only had under his immediate control General Claude Legrand's 1st division of IV Corps, the Corps cavalry under General Jacob François Marulaz and the cuirassiers from the 2nd heavy cavalry division of General Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice. Masséna promptly engaged Klenau, {{while at the same}} time conducting a full reconnaissance of the battlefield, which enabled him to write to the Emperor and reconfirm that no Austrian regiments were heading towards Krems. Masséna's attacks were at first successful, but Klenau counterattacked and repulsed the French and then opposed staunch resistance to any further attacks. The outnumbered Masséna was forced to break off the combat and wait for his other three infantry divisions, knowing that Claude Carra Saint-Cyr's division would be able to rejoin him shortly, but that Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's and Jean Boudet's were much <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> to be of any assistance.|$|E

500|$|The ICAO {{released}} {{their report}} December 2, 1983, which {{concluded that the}} violation of Soviet airspace was accidental: One of two explanations for the aircraft's deviation was that the autopilot had remained in HEADING hold instead of INS mode after departing Anchorage. They postulated that this inflight navigational error was caused by either the crew's failure to select INS mode, or the inertial navigation's not activating when selected, because the aircraft was already <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> track. It was determined that the crew did not notice this error or subsequently perform navigational checks, that would have revealed that the aircraft was diverging further and further from its assigned route. This was later deemed {{to be caused by}} a [...] "lack of situational awareness and flight deck coordination".|$|E

[...] About a new White Stripes album, Jack said, [...] "It won't be <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off.</b> Maybe next year." [...] Jack also explained Meg's acute anxiety during the Stripes' last tour, saying, [...] "I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg {{had come from a}} dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness. Meg is a very shy girl, a very quiet and shy person.

It is not because a man with fearless frankness breasts the full torrent of popular persuasion and {{universal}} practice that he is to be thrust aside as a fanatic, with hard words and unfeeling sneers concerning his sanity. Here, again, I avow my persuasion that Mr. Ruskin is, in one sense, <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in advance, and, in another, <b>too</b> <b>far</b> {{in the rear of}} the time; and while I attempt an explanatory justification of the modern practice, I admit that it is only [...] "for the hardness of our hearts" [...] and because the golden age is still <b>far</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R

It is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day. And so a child could. But with me and such as me it is different. One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet. It is so difficult to keep 'heights that the soul is competent to gain.' We think in eternity, but we move slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back into one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for their coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave whose slave it is one's chance or choice to be.|$|R
2500|$|Graph {{departed}} from Lerwick on her third war patrol on 24 December 1942 {{with three other}} Royal Navy submarines; their task was to patrol the waters {{off the coast of}} Norway in the area of Altafjord. At 1am on 1 January 1943, at the position , she sighted the German heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper, returning from the unsuccessful attack on convoy JW 51B, better known as the Battle of the Barents Sea. Hipper was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> and travelling too fast to be attacked. At 4:23am, Graph sighted two German destroyers moving erratically and at low speed.

2500|$|After {{the debacle}} of Game1, Colorado {{appeared}} {{to return to}} form, scoring quickly on a groundout by Todd Helton with runners on second and third in the first. However, {{this would be the}} only time the Rockies ever led in the series as postseason veteran Curt Schilling ( [...] IP, one run, four hits) and Boston's bullpen (Okajima, [...] IP; Papelbon, [...] IP) allowed no other runs in the contest. The Red Sox tied the game in the fourth off of Ubaldo Jimenez on Jason Varitek's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third, then took the lead next inning on Mike Lowell's RBI double with runners on first and second. Matt Holliday had four of Colorado's five hits in Game2, including a base hit off Papelbon with two outs in the eighth. Before throwing another pitch, Papelbon caught Holliday leaning <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> first base and picked him off—Papelbon's first career pickoff.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Graettinger's [...] "Thermopylae" [...] (from the City of Glass CD) is {{the first}} Graettinger work {{recorded}} by the Kenton Orchestra (December 1947); the title referring to the famous Battle of Thermopylae fought in 480 BC between the Greeks and Persians. [...] Venudor's and Cox's comparison to Alexander Mosolov's Iron Foundry is not <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> but Thermopylae can better be compared to Italian Futurism music as well as larger more involved movements of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's suites of the time (George Antheil's music would be another). Graettinger's treatment of the sax section juxtaposed against the straight 8th note pulse with Weidler's muscular 'Hodgesesque' lead alto playing places the work firmly in the camp of Ellington's 'Jungle Music,' the influence of Benny Carter's playing and writing is clearly evident also. Graettinger's intention is far closer to jazz than to the modernism of Russians or any classical music of the time; this makes it no less innovative but merely assigns the lineage to a more accurate place. Second alto saxophonist/clarinetist Art Pepper sums up the comparison to Ellington this way, [...] "...Graettinger didn't just write for a band, or for sections; he wrote for each individual person, more or less as Ellington did. It was so difficult to play because you were independent of the guy next to you." ...|$|E
