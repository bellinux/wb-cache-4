60|$|There were a {{great many}} things like that which no good father would have done, {{but the thing that}} made Pony lose all patience, and begin getting ready to run off right away, was the way his father behaved when Pony got mad at the teacher one day, and brought his books home, and said he was not going back to that school any more. The reason was because the teacher had put Pony back from third reader to the second and made him go into a class of little fellows not more than seven years old. It {{happened}} one morning, after a day when Pony had read very badly in the afternoon, and though he had explained that he had read badly because the weather was so hot, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> he might try it in the second reader till the weather changed, at any rate; and the whole school laughed.

5000|$|The problem, then, becomes evident: {{the massive}} {{education}} system cannot account for differences between its subjects, from different learning preferences to different teaching styles to different paces. Student-Directed Teaching asks, [...] "why do students {{all have to}} do the same thing, at the same time, in the same manner?" [...] It is because of this, according to the Student-Directed Teaching philosophy, that students lose faith in school: gifted students are not challenged enough while students that fall behind have little support. Thus, the public education system rewards those who remain in the middle: these are the students who receive praise because they never challenge the teacher, give textbook answers on homework and spit back cute phrases <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> yesterday. These are students who understand that challenging the status quo and being different carries a penalty.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine how {{teachers}} teach English and if they feel that their knowledge of English is enough to be teaching English.

The methodology that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> used during my observations was, total physical response, scaffolding, zone of proximal development, pronunciation, phrases and behaviorism. What I could see during to my observations was that in the classes where <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> spoke more English than Swedish the pupils did so too. I could also see that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> used different methods during their lessons because they wanted to benefit all pupils, since the pupils prefer to learn in different ways. The content of the lessons was a subject that the pupils can easily relate to and has an interest in. From the questionnaires I could see that all teachers considered themselves to be at the same level in their knowledge of English according to which level they marked in the CEFR-scale. Three of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> that their English knowledge didn’t affect their English lessons or their choice of methods.

There he excelled in his studies and became the teacher's favourite student, enjoying special privileges in his teacher's house. However, the other students grew jealous of Ahimsaka's speedy progress and sought to turn his master against him. To that end, they made it seem as though Ahimsaka had seduced the master's wife and boasted that he was wiser than the guru. Unwilling or unable to attack Ahimsaka directly (Pad states that Ahimsaka was as [...] "strong as seven elephants", while Ps states that the teacher worried that his business would suffer if he {{was found to have}} murdered a student), <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> that Ahimsaka's training was complete, but that he must provide the traditional final gift offered to a guru before the teacher would grant his approval. As his payment, the teacher demanded 1,000 fingers, each taken from a different victim, thinking that Angulimala would be killed in the course of seeking this grisly prize (Pad states that Angulimala was required to fetch 1,000 fingers from right hands, seemingly unaware that this could be achieved by killing 200 people. Ps states, even more strangely, that he was told to [...] "kill a thousand legs", and gathered fingers only as an aid to keeping an accurate count).|$|E

After being arrested and charged by the Brooklyn District Attorney, the {{investigation}} was dropped when the child retracted his claim. The teacher wrote how Seewald confronted him at his house “rather aggressively,” and demanded he confess to molesting the child. This individual was placed on the Wall of Shame, in an effort to warn the community of the potential harm. When the case was dismissed, JCW removed him from the Wall. This he says destroyed his career and social standing. He wrote that “In people’s eyes I was no longer a Jew, let alone a human being, ... I was regarded as a monster, an out-of-control filthy, dangerous beast capable of snatching little children and sexually abusing them.” Soon after however, Seewald did remove the name and picture from the blog, citing that there was insufficient evidence against the teacher. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> that because forgiveness is his nature, he removed his article criticizing JCW and replaced it with one praising Seewald’s work, blaming student who falsely accused him rather than JCW. The tablet concluded that JCW’s credibility never fully recovered from the debacle. The Teacher wrote about his case which was publish on local blogs.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the opportunities for oral language development that teachers offer pupils during lessons in Swedish in grade 3. The following questions guided the study: how do teachers perceive that they offer the pupils opportunities for oral language development in their teaching and what possibilities for oral language development do <b>teachers</b> offer pupils? <b>The</b> methods used to answer the questions are interview and observation of two teachers in two different classrooms. In all, two interviews and four observations were conducted. An observation schedule was used during the observations and the interviews were semi-structured, based on the same questions. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. The collected material showed that the oral activities which <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> they offered their pupils were working in pairs or small groups, whole-class conversations and drama. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> that they interacted with the pupils through taking turns and asking questions. <b>The</b> activities <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> offered their pupils during the four observations were whole-class conversations led by <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> structured conversations in small groups and spontaneous conversations among pupils and between pupils and teacher, and interactive book reading. The interactions used by <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> took <b>the</b> form of speech, questions and body language. The conclusion of the study is that teachers must have more tools for taking advantage of opportunities to let the pupils develop their oral language. The view of what oral language development can involve should also be broadened...|$|R

Supplementary textbooks on English grammar, vocabulary, and English proficiency tests, such as the TOEIC and General English Proficiency Test, were frequently used in the regular and afterschool English classes. Listening articles, conversations, or passages in the English magazines were played to all students in class once a week. During the 30 -min listening sessions, students sometimes listened to the recordings and read the magazine, or took a listening quiz.|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examined}} the effectiveness of social story interventions for an eight-year old Chinese boy diagnosed with mild Asperger’s disorder in an international school in Hong Kong. A personalised approach based on Carol Grays (1994) Social Story Handbook was utilized.

Specifically the following behaviours were targeted: calling out to the teacher, laughing inappropriately, repeating what <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> and frequent visits to the toilet. Pre-intervention observations were made over a one week period followed by a 2 week intervention which concluded with post-intervention observations over a one week period.
