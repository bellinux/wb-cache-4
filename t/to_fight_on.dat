5|$|Bormann and Himmler shared {{responsibility}} for the Volkssturm (people's militia), which drafted all remaining able-bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last-ditch militia founded on 18 October 1944.

5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> foot.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi opposed {{providing}} {{any help}} to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II. Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure.

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> ice, and that their own horses had been trained <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E

5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, the North Koreans were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the North Koreans were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> the front lines, eventually preventing the North Koreans from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the North Koreans from the area.|$|E

5|$|Leo the Wise died in 912, and {{hostilities}} soon resumed as Simeon {{marched to}} Constantinople {{at the head}} of a large army. Though the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was in disarray and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of basileus (emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople. The Empire now faced the problem of a powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople, as well as having <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> two fronts.|$|E

5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
