Due to political instability and social unrest, <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> and their houses declined.

50|$|About 1619 Louis XIII named Cardinal François de La Rochefoucauld abbot of Saint Genevieve's. <b>The</b> <b>canons</b> {{had been}} lax and the {{cardinal}} selected Charles Faure to reform them.

In 1634, he and a dozen companions took charge of Saint-Geneviève-du-Mont of Paris. This became the mother-house of a new congregation, <b>the</b> <b>Canons</b> Regular of Ste.

5|$|The {{entry of}} the Turin canon {{pertaining}} to Nyuserre is damaged and {{the duration of}} his rule is difficult to read with certainty. Following Alan Gardiner's 1959 study of <b>the</b> <b>canon,</b> scholars such as Nigel Strudwick credited Nyuserre with 11 years of reign. Gardiner's reading of <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> was then reevaluated from facsimiles, yielding a 24 to 25 years figure for Nyuserre's reign. This duration is accepted by some scholars including Nicolas Grimal. More recent analyses of the original papyrus conducted by Kim Ryholt have shown that Nyuserre's reign length as reported on the document could equally be 11–14, 21–24, or 31–34 years. The later figure is now favoured by Egyptologists including Strudwick and Verner.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate {{the text of the}} Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. <b>The</b> <b>canon</b> tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E
5|$|The operas in the Bayreuth canon are {{the last}} ten of the {{thirteen}} that Wagner completed. He rejected the first three – Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi – as apprentice works. Although these have been staged elsewhere and Rienzi was very popular into the early 20th century, the works in <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> exceed them, both {{in the number of}} performances given and in the number of available recordings. The term Bayreuth canon is therefore sometimes taken to mean the composer's mature operas. Georg Solti was the first conductor to complete studio recordings of all the works in <b>the</b> <b>canon,</b> starting in 1958 with Das Rheingold and finishing in 1986 with Lohengrin.|$|E

50|$|Initially, the {{basilica}} {{was outside the}} city of Milan, but over the following centuries, the city grew up around it. It became a center of religious life and a community of <b>canons</b> developed in <b>the</b> church. In 789, a monastery was established within {{the basilica}} grounds. <b>The</b> <b>canons,</b> however, retained their own community and identity instead of fading away. Two, separate, distinct religious communities shared the basilica. In the 11th century, <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> adopted orders and became Canons Regular. There were now two separate monastic orders following different rules living in <b>the</b> basilica. <b>The</b> <b>canons</b> were in <b>the</b> northern building, the cloister of <b>the</b> <b>canons,</b> while <b>the</b> monks were in the two southern buildings.|$|R

5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. <b>The</b> <b>canon</b> tables themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of <b>the</b> <b>canon</b> tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E

40|$|A regrettable side-effect of Karl Llewellyn 2 ̆ 7 s {{interesting}} {{critique of}} <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> of statutory construction 1 was that intellectual debate about <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> was derailed {{for almost a}} quarter of a century. In his critique, Professor Llewellyn purported to show that <b>the</b> <b>canons</b> of statutory construction were useless as rules for guiding decisions.
