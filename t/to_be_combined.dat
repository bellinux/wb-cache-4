5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E

In 1993 the Greater London boundary, to the east of Cranham and north of the railway line, was locally realigned to the M25 motorway, returning some mostly unpopulated areas of open land to Essex and leaving North Ockendon as the only part of Greater London outside the bounds of the motorway.|$|E

5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E
5|$|The discoveries Cassini {{has made}} at Enceladus have {{prompted}} studies into follow-up mission concepts, including a flyby plume sample-return mission by NASA, a probe flyby (Journey to Enceladus and Titan or JET) to analyze plume contents in-situ, a lander by the German Aerospace Center {{to study the}} habitability potential of its subsurface ocean (Enceladus Explorer), and two astrobiology-oriented mission concepts (the Enceladus Life Finder and Life Investigation For Enceladus).

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> to create new and varied effects.|$|E

Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing {{the direction in which}} the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s brought {{little league}} success, but were notable for goal-scoring by Jack Connor, whose 140 goals in five seasons {{are still a}} club record. These {{included}} 13 hat-tricks (three of which were consecutive – once against Crewe Alexandra and twice against Chester), two instances of four goals in a match (against Workington and Carlisle United), and two of five goals in a match (against Bradford Park Avenue and the Tranmere Rovers). When the regional Third Divisions were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> into national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957–58 campaign, Stockport {{finished in the top}} half of the Third Division North and so were placed in the following season's national Third Division.|$|E

The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E

5|$|Politicians have signalized {{that they}} want to {{electrify}} the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer along with the Meråker Line. NSB will need to replace the Class 92 trains towards the end the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification. The county municipalities of Nord-Trøndelag and Sør-Trøndelag proposed during the early 2000s that the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Steinkjer be upgraded reduce travel time to one hour. This would require the average speed to be increased to , mainly through a modernization of the existing line. Specific projects include electrification, double track between Trondheim and Trondheim Airport, additional passing loops, a new bridge over Stjørdalselva and a rearrangement of the tracks at Hell. This would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with a {{reduction in the number of}} stops. The National Rail Administration estimates that the mentioned investments, which would cost between NOK4 and 6 billion, will allow a travel time of one hour and ten minutes. If a number of curves are straightened, increased capacity is introduced between Stjørdal and Steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed, travel time could be reduced to one hour.|$|E
