5|$|After {{moving through}} torrential rain, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> reached Elephant Point at 16:00, and close-quarters {{fighting}} then took place, with flame-throwers being used against several Japanese bunkers guarding the battery. About forty Japanese soldiers and gunners were {{killed during the}} assault, and <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> also sustained several casualties. After the battery had been secured <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> dug in around Elephant Point and awaited {{the arrival of the}} relief force, which landed at Thaungang at 15:30, with a supply drop following it several minutes later. As it neared the position of <b>the</b> <b>battalion,</b> the surgical team accompanying the relief force was accidentally fired upon by the Gurkhas, causing four members of the team to be wounded. <b>The</b> <b>battalion</b> remained where it was through the night, although high tides submerged a number of trenches and forced <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> to higher ground.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> {{was to be}} Australia's first {{airborne}} unit {{it required}} extensive training. Consequently, in addition to basic parachute training at Richmond, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> also trained in jungle warfare at Canungra in Queensland. In September 1943, Major John Overall, formerly of the 2/13th Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, was appointed as commanding officer. Throughout this time training continued in the demolitions, tactics and parachuting, and as no reserve parachutes were used several fatalities occurred. A third rifle company was formed in October 1943 and by January 1944 <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> was at full strength. Following company and battalion level exercises <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> was declared ready for operations in May 1944 and moved to Mareeba airstrip in North Queensland. A fourth rifle company was formed in June 1944. In August 1944 <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> gained its own organic indirect fire support when it was joined by the parachute qualified 1st Mountain Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, equipped with short 25 Pounder guns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} Allied {{offensive}} in Italy, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> {{was assigned to}} the new 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, which was allocated as the divisional reserve in April for Operation Buckland.

Tiger tanks forced <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> to dismount and dig in before the Tigers were knocked out by Allied artillery. A and C Squadrons supported the 22nd Battalion in attacking Squazzaloca. <b>The</b> <b>battalion</b> reached the Sillaro River, crossed it at first light and was relieved by the 27th Battalion on 15 April. D Squadron cleared Sesto Imolese of Axis troops, with A and BSquadrons protecting the left flank. On 16–17 April, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> protected the right flank behind the 22nd Battalion. The attack across the Gaiana began with a massive artillery barrage during the night of 18 April. Although <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> crossed the river unopposed, it was counter-attacked beyond the barrage area. Advancing against stiff Axis resistance, A and CSquadrons were {{on the far side of}} the Quaderna Canal by 01:30 on 19 April. <b>The</b> <b>battalion</b> dug in there, resisting Axis counter-attacks; eleven men from <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> were killed and 47 wounded.|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{reorganisation}} and training followed as <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> {{was prepared for}} the rigours of jungle warfare. <b>The</b> <b>battalion</b> concentrated at the Nagambie Road Camp in central Victoria initially, but in late September moved to Greta in New South Wales. In October, {{after a period of}} intense training, the 2/6th was moved to Brisbane from where, on 13 October 1942, they embarked on the Dutch merchant ship Bontekoe, bound for Milne Bay for the first of their two campaigns there against the Japanese. After arriving at Milne Bay, where the 17th Brigade was held in reserve, on 19 October they remained there until January 1943, when <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> embarked upon the MV Pulganbar and several smaller coastal vessels and moved to Port Moresby. From Moresby, they were airlifted to Wau on 14 January. During the battalion's time around Milne Bay, they had suffered heavily from malaria and over 300 men were in hospital at the time <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> deployed to Wau; consequently, it was severely understrength by the time it went into battle. Nevertheless, throughout late January 1943, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> was heavily involved in the Battle of Wau, then afterwards took part in the advance on Salamaua, during which it fought several key actions, including the fighting around Lababia Ridge in late June, before supporting the landing at Nassau Bay and the Battle of Mubo in July and then taking part in the fighting around Mount Tambu and Komiatum Ridge in August.

By the start of February they reached Mosina and after receiving intelligence that a Japanese force had been detected at Warapa, they sent out to raid their camp. Upon reaching Warapa the patrol set fire to the huts in which the Japanese force was billeted and then withdrew. Later reconnaissance determined that 15 Japanese had died in the blaze. By 12 February <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> married up with patrols from the 25th Battalion that were moving along the Tavera River and then later, as <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> continued on towards Mosigetta, one company linked up with patrols from the 9th Battalion on 17 February.|$|E
5|$|After Wau was secured, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> {{undertook}} patrolling operations around Mubo, {{along with}} the rest of Kanga Force, before joining the advance on Salamaua in support of the 3rd Division, with a view to drawing Japanese reinforcements away from Lae, where a landing was planned for September. The Japanese put up a strong resistance and <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> became involved in heavy fighting around Mubo in May, before fighting at Goodview Junction and Mount Tambu in July and August as part of actions to secure Komiatum; around Goodview, two companies were deployed in a holding action and to attempt to outflank Mount Tambu to cut the Japanese line of communication, while the other two companies attacked Mount Tambu itself. Casualties for <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> between April and September amounted to 34 killed and 95 wounded. As the 5th Division arrived to take over from the 3rd following the capture of Mount Tambu and the link up with US forces, the 2/5th Battalion was withdrawn from the line, concentrating around Nassau Bay in late August as the 17th Brigade was relieved by the 29th. After a fortnight of unloading ships around the bay, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> was moved by landing craft to Milne Bay, where it embarked on the Liberty ship Charles Steinmetz and the Dutch transport Boschfontein. On 23 September 1943, <b>the</b> <b>battalion</b> arrived back in Australia, landing at Cairns, Queensland.
