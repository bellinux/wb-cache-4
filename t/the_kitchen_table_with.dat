5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E
2500|$|The autopsy also {{revealed}} a [...] "vegetable or fruit material which may represent pineapple" [...] which JonBenét had eaten {{a few hours}} before her death. Photographs of the home taken on the day when JonBenét's body was found show a bowl of pineapple on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> a spoon in it. However, both Patsy and John Ramsey said they did not remember putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBenét. Police reported that they found JonBenét's nine-year-old brother Burke Ramsey's fingerprints on the bowl. The Ramseys have always maintained that Burke slept through the entire episode until he was awakened several hours after the police arrived.|$|E

They then spent their honeymoon at Pigotts, Eric Gill’s craft {{community}} {{set in the}} beechwood forest at Speen, Buckinghamshire. During his career at the BBC he lived in London and had one daughter.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few hours}} later Deacon Latham came into {{the house with a}} milk-pan full of pease. He set this down on one end of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> his straw hat beside it, and then took a chair at the other end and fell into the {{attitude}} of the day before, when he sat in the parlor with Lydia and Miss Maria waiting for the stage; his mouth was puckered to a whistle, and his fingers were held above the board in act to drub it. Miss Maria turned the pease out on the table, and took the pan into her lap. She shelled at the pease in silence, till the sound of their pelting, as they were dropped on the tin, was lost in their multitude; then she said, with a sharp, querulous, pathetic impatience, [...] "Well, father, I suppose you're thinkin' about Lyddy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] said Sara, laying Aunt Josephina's letter down on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> such {{energy that}} in anybody but Sara {{it must have}} been said she threw it down, [...] "this is {{positively}} the last straw! I have endured all the rest. I have given up my chance of a musical education, when Aunt Nan offered it, that I might stay home and help Willard pay the mortgage off--if it doesn't pay us off first--and I have, which was much harder, accepted the fact that we can't possibly afford to send Ray to the Valley Academy, even if I wore the same hat and coat for four winters. I did not grumble when Uncle Joel came here to live because he wanted to be 'near his dear nephew's children.' I felt it my Christian duty to look pleasant when we had to give Cousin Caroline a home to save her from the poorhouse. But my endurance and philosophy, and worst of all, my furniture, has reached a limit. I cannot have Aunt Josephina come here to spend the winter, because I have no room to put her in." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} the {{household}} furniture came to be sold for the family benefit, or who sold it, except that I did not. Sold it was, however, and carried away in a van; except the bed, a few chairs, and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b> <b>With</b> these possessions we encamped, as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, the children, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those rooms night and day. I have no idea for how long, though {{it seems to me}} for a long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself. So I took the key of the house to the landlord, who was very glad to get it; and the beds were sent over to the King's Bench, except mine, for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution, very much to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine was a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard; and when I took possession of it, with the reflection that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I thought it quite a paradise.|$|E
5000|$|The {{boom in the}} {{underground}} press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing, which {{made it possible to}} print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars, which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit. Paper was cheap, and many printing firms around the country had over-expanded during the 1950s and had excess capacity on their offset web presses, which could be negotiated for at bargain rates. [...] Most papers operated on a shoestring budget, pasting up camera-ready copy on layout sheets on <b>the</b> editor's <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> labor performed by unpaid, non-union volunteers. Typesetting costs, which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers, were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted up by hand. As one observer commented with only slight hyperbole, students were financing the publication of these papers out of their lunch money.|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> fully loaded, <b>with</b> a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> L.D. argues <b>with</b> his {{daughter}} Rae, age 15, about her beliefs. Maxine, the wife, comes home and notices L.D. is drunk. Maxine sides with Rae, saying she can like what she likes. In {{a moment of}} fury, L.D. throws a pickle jar through the window, shattering the glass. Maxine gives L.D. an ultimatum: he must pack his things and go or she'll call the police. L.D. starts packing, stuffing not only his belongings into his suitcase but also vindictively taking womanly toiletries he could make no use of. Taking one last look around, about to leave for good, L.D. says he has {{one more thing to}} tell his wife and daughter but, suddenly inarticulate, he is unable to put what he feels into words. The manuscript version of the same title appears in Beginners (2009).|$|R

"Now, let me see," [...] said Aunt Cyrilla reflectively, tapping <b>the</b> snowy <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{point of}} her plump, dimpled forefinger, [...] "what shall I take? That big fruit cake for one thing--Edward does like my fruit cake; and that cold boiled tongue for another. Those three mince pies too, they'd spoil {{before we got}} back or your uncle'd make himself sick eating them--mince pie is his besetting sin. And that little stone bottle full of cream--Geraldine may carry any amount of style, but I've yet to see her look down on real good country cream, Lucy Rose; and another bottle of my {{raspberry}} vinegar. That plate of jelly cookies and doughnuts will please the children and fill up the chinks, and you can bring me that box of ice-cream candy out of the pantry, and that bag of striped candy sticks your uncle brought home from the corner last night. And apples, of course--three or four dozen of those good eaters--and a little pot of my greengage preserves--Edward'll like that. And some sandwiches and pound cake for a snack for ourselves. Now, I guess that will do for eatables. The presents for the children can go in on top. There's a doll for Daisy and the little boat your uncle made for Ray and a tatted lace handkerchief apiece for the twins, and the crochet hood for the baby. Now, is that all?" ...|$|R
3000|$|To {{verify the}} {{concepts}} of neuro-symbolic recognition, it was applied to a building automation environment. In concrete, the test environment was <b>the</b> office <b>kitchen</b> of <b>the</b> Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) at the Vienna University of Technology [33, 34]. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> comprises a <b>table</b> <b>with</b> eight chairs and a kitchen cabinet including a stove, a sink, a dishwasher, and a coffee machine. For testing the recognition model, <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> was equipped with sensors of different types: tactile floor sensors, motion detectors, door contact sensors, window contacts, light barriers, temperature sensors, a humidity sensor, brightness sensors, a microphone, and a camera. From these sensor data, different scenarios had to be perceived following the information processing principles proposed in Section 4.1. As by these measures, <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> became an [...] "intelligent" [...] system capable of autonomously perceiving {{what is going on}} in it, it got <b>the</b> name Smart <b>Kitchen.</b>|$|R

His often complex compositions—typically of sunlit interiors and gardens populated with friends and family members—are both narrative and autobiographical.

I was sitting at <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel." [...] Last Bus to Woodstock was published in 1975 and introduced the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose penchants for cryptic crosswords, English literature, cask ale, and Wagner reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots used false leads and other red herrings.|$|E
