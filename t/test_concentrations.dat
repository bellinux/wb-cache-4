50|$|SB-269970 is a {{drug and}} {{research}} chemical developed by GlaxoSmithKline used in scientific studies. It is believed {{to act as a}} selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist (EC50 = 1.25 nM) (or possibly inverse agonist). A subsequent study in guinea pig at 10 uM showed that it also blocks the α2-adrenergic receptor activity.

50|$|Compared {{with the}} effects of {{polyphenols}} in vitro, the effects in vivo, although the subject of ongoing research, are limited and vague. The reasons for this are 1) the absence of validated in vivo biomarkers, especially for inflammation or carcinogenesis; 2) long-term studies failing to demonstrate effects with a mechanism of action, specificity or efficacy; and 3) invalid applications of high, unphysiological <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the in vitro studies, which are subsequently irrelevant for the design of in vivo experiments.|$|E

30|$|The most {{significant}} difference in ecotoxicological impact was observed when comparing wet and dry spiking methods. Wet spiking resulted in stronger effects than dry spiking. The effects caused by dry spiking were concentration-dependent for the selected <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> (3 - 6 concentrations, depending on the test) whereas {{there was no such}} relationship for the two <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> when wet spiking methods were applied using water as the carrier. Lower wet spiking concentrations than those reported here may have resulted in concentration-effect curves. Higher <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{do not seem to be}} appropriate because the bioavailability of the particles appeared to be limited when highly-concentrated nanoparticle suspensions were used for wet spiking. Therefore, concentration-dependent effect curves are more difficult to obtain for wet application methods compared to dry spiking because the appropriate range of <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> has to be selected. The use of highly-concentrated stock suspensions could generate false negative results and incorrect hazard assessments. Limit tests investigating a single high test concentration are therefore inappropriate for wet spiking. Dry spiking is the preferred application method for solid, uncoated TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles to ensure the effects are not dependent on the particle concentration used for spiking, even though the bioavailability is reduced by the dry spiking method. Satisfactory test substance homogeneity can be achieved using a solid carrier, at least for Ag. If wet application is necessary, then further experiments will be required to establish parameters for successful use, e.g. the use of dispersants that are more suitable than water or recommendations on the procedure to select suitable <b>test</b> <b>concentrations.</b>|$|E

As {{there has been no}} agreement on which MDBGN test preparation to use, a study was initiated to help determine the optimal patch test preparation for MDBGN. 2661 consecutively patch tested patients at 11 test clinics representing 9 European countries participated. Petrolatum preparations with MDBGN at 1. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 3 % and 0. 1 % were inserted in the standard series. Contact allergy rates were noted in the range 4. 4 - 1. 1 % following decreasing <b>test</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Reactions not fulfilling all criteria to be classified as allergic reactions could represent either weak allergic or irritant reactions, and such reactions were noted in the range 8. 2 - 0. 5 % with decreasing concentrations. A significant number of these reactions represented weak allergic reactions, as allergic reactions were obtained to higher patch <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the same individual. Morphologically irritant reactions were noted only for the highest <b>test</b> <b>concentrations.</b> In summary, the contact allergy rates and frequencies of doubtful and irritant reactions vary with the patch test concentration.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that whereas the diluted filtrate had little toxicity, diluted unfiltered dispersions were toxic. This apparent contradiction reflects differences in the way samples below the highest <b>test</b> <b>concentration</b> were prepared. Each TiO 2 dispersion was prepared separately from powder, and the shape of the saturation curve (see Figs. 3 and 4) suggests there was a surplus of the smaller nanoparticles responsible for toxicity. In contrast, the diluted filtrates were prepared by serially diluting the sample with the highest <b>test</b> <b>concentration,</b> resulting in a concomitant reduction in the concentration of smaller, more toxic nanoparticles. It is also possible that further agglomeration of particles in the dispersion samples may have contributed to the discrepancy.|$|R

30|$|For {{tests in}} aqueous media, the {{nanoparticle}} {{concentration in the}} dispersion affects {{the size of the}} resulting agglomerates, which reduces the toxicity of the nanoparticles[29, 30]. Tests using Caenorhabditis elegans on agar plates resulted in the steady-state inhibition of survival despite the increasing <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Ag nanoparticles[31]. Therefore, we propose that the statistically-significant but concentration-independent effects of nanoparticle dispersions we observed reflect the comparable bioavailability of nanoparticles with different total concentrations due to the agglomeration behavior of nanoparticles in the stock preparation. We tested the two nanoparticle concentrations (10 and 20 mg/L) based on different stock suspensions (100 and 200 mg/L) and observed ecotoxicological effects on plants, earthworms and nitrogen-transforming microorganisms. We observed statistically-significant differences between experimental and control vessels in terms of plant growth and earthworm reproduction, although the mean values of the relevant parameters (plant fresh weight, number of juvenile earthworms) did not correspond to the differing concentrations. For example, the higher <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> had a lower impact on plant biomass, and the number of juvenile earthworms was similar at both <b>test</b> <b>concentrations.</b> It is possible that concentration-effect relationships could be revealed by repeating the tests at lower concentrations based on less-concentrated stock suspensions.|$|E
40|$|Cellular stress {{responses}} are frequently {{presumed to be}} more sensitive than traditional ecotoxicological life cycle end points such as survival and growth. Yet, the focus to reduce test duration and to generate more sensitive end points has caused transcriptomics studies to be performed at low doses during short exposures, separately and independently from traditional ecotoxicity tests, making comparisons with life cycle end points indirect. Therefore we aimed to directly compare the effects on growth, survival, and gene expression of the nonbiting midge Chironomus riparius. To this purpose, we simultaneously analyzed life cycle and transcriptomics responses of chironomid larvae exposed to four model toxicants. We observed that already at the lowest <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> many transcripts were significantly differentially expressed, while the life cycle end points of C. riparius were hardly affected. Analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts showed that at the lowest <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> substantial and biologically relevant cellular stress was induced and that many transcripts responded already maximally at these lowest <b>test</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The direct comparison between molecular end life cycle responses after fourteen days of exposure revealed that gene expression is more sensitive to toxicant exposure than life cycle end points, underlining the potential of transcriptomics for ecotoxicity testing and environmental risk assessment...|$|E

We investigated the viability, cell number, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the expression of osteogenic genes of C 2 C 12 cells after exposure to gentamicin at concentrations of 12. 5 – 800  μg/ml for 48  h. Exposure of C 2 C 12 cells to gentamicin (12. 5 – 800  mg/ml) for 48  h showed no {{significant changes in the}} cell number, but cell viability was decreased by one-third at the <b>tested</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 200 – 800  μg/ml.

Any <b>tested</b> <b>concentration</b> of gentamicin up to 800  μg/ml for 48  h did not inhibit or decrease the osteogenic gene expression of osterix and alkaline phosphatase of the C 2 C 12 cells.
