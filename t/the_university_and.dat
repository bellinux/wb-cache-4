5|$|In 1998, as {{a result}} of the {{continuing}} development in the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>and</b> the nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation.

Between 2000 and 2004, <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>and</b> Roehampton worked together as the Federal University of Surrey. In June 2004, the Privy Council granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became Roehampton University from 1 August 2004.

5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured the {{fellowship}} in 1809 {{on the strength}} of a first.

Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the censure of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E
