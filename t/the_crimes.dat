A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this we turn to the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences.

These vows must take place during the same life cycle that <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> were committed in.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} a result of a {{critical}} consideration of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of robbery as defined in South African law. The historical origin and development of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> was investigated. <b>The</b> development of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of robbery in South African law and the current law relating to robbery were researched. Sentencing for <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of robbery in South African law is discussed and relevant aspects relating to criminal procedure were identified. The constitutionality of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> was also analysed. <b>The</b> <b>crime</b> of robbery as defined in the jurisdictions of England, Canada and Germany were subsequently considered on a legal-comparative basis. The study demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of robbery still warrants a separate existence in South African law. However, certain problem areas relating to the ambit of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> are identified. One of these problem areas is so-called “bag-snatching ” where South African courts have applied the elements of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> arbitrarily, resulting in legal uncertainty. The conclusion reached is that the law relating to robbery is in need of reform. <b>The</b> <b>crime</b> situation in South Africa today, and the increase in violent crime, including robbery, make the broadening of the ambit of <b>the</b> common-law <b>crime</b> advisable. Various such proposals are made including the introduction of legislation which broadens the ambit of <b>the</b> common-law <b>crime.</b> A scale on which the various manifestations of the offence are rated according to their severity, is suggested to provide guidance to courts when sentencing those found guilty of robbery. In conclusion, draft legislation which delineates the offence in its various manifestations is proposed...|$|R
