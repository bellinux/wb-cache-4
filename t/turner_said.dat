5|$|Incidentally, Turner's {{favorite}} {{sport is}} soccer, not football. He is {{also interested in}} foreign cultures and expressed regret at being unable to spend a semester abroad because of college football. <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> that, dependent upon the outcome of his football career, {{he would like to}} attend the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He also got to meet his childhood idol David Beckham while at the 2010 South Africa world cup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
25|$|According to Carolyn Feibel and Bradley Olson of the Houston Chronicle, the Houston Chronicle {{obtained}} {{documents that}} show that the city eminent domain helped Ed Wulfe, the developer of the BLVD Place complex adjacent to the park, complete a $12.5 million land sale related to the development. Wulfe was a major donor to White. As of December 2008 the city had not created any plans for the Post Oak Lane Park. Houston Parks and Recreation Director Joe <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> in a sworn disposition in November 2008 that his department did not create {{the idea of the}} park and that he opposed the usage of eminent domain. The Collins brothers said that the city government had used eminent domain to seize land only for the purposes of private development, which is not legal in Texas.|$|E

But it's the kids who provide the {{highlights}} in this one, with their antics at Duff Gardens." [...] The author of Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation, Chris <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> it [...] "Fills in with the usual grab bag of great gags" [...] and [...] "The episode had some crowd-pleasing moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey's ambitions {{may have}} {{included}} becoming King of England, which {{may account for}} some of the harshness that his two legitimate half-brothers displayed towards him. His military abilities, displayed in the rebellion of 1173–1174, as well his custody of castles near Tours, would have also fed into Richard's disquiet over Geoffrey's possible intentions. Geoffrey was known to be ambitious, which led the historian D. L. Douie to call him a [...] "formidable bastard". The historian Ralph <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> of Geoffrey that [...] "he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth" [...] and that he had [...] "inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets".|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Citizen Kane {{became a}} {{catalyst}} in {{the controversy over}} the colorization of black-and-white films. One proponent of film colorization was Ted Turner, whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library. A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that Citizen Kane would not be colorized, but in July 1988 <b>Turner</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Citizen Kane? I'm thinking of colorizing it." [...] In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him [...] "don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons." ...|$|E

5000|$|On August 30, 2009, British Financial Services Authority {{chairman}} Lord Adair <b>Turner</b> had <b>said</b> it was [...] "ridiculous" [...] {{to think}} he would propose a new tax on London and not {{the rest of the}} world.

500|$|William de Warenne (died 1209), the feudal baron of Wormegay, was a royal justice under King Richard I and {{his brother}} King John. Besides being a royal justice, Warenne served in {{financial}} matters, being one of those responsible for collecting taxes and oversaw debts from Christians to Jews. His career was closely tied to that of Hubert Walter, who employed Warenne as a judge in some ecclesiastical matters. He also founded a priory and gave other gifts to religious houses. The historian Ralph <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> of Warenne that [...] "although he was a longtime official under King John, he did not quite fit into the inner corps of royal counselors".|$|E
500|$|Turner {{stated that}} she was on a [...] "downhill slide" [...] for much of the 1970s, {{drinking}} heavily, not eating, missing performances, and weighing only 95 pounds. [...] "I was a sipper but I never got high or drunk," [...] <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> in a 1982 interview. [...] "It was much more insidious. It was starting to affect my liver and my health... I was very sick." [...] She decided to stop drinking, and began eating all organic food; she would credit herbalism as helping her overcome her alcoholism. Turner claimed she was chaste for the remainder of her life, after her final divorce in 1969 and had no desire to marry again.|$|E
500|$|Mudhoney {{recorded}} the song at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio in March 1988, {{three months after}} the band's formation. Producer Jack Endino was surprised by how noisy the sessions were and how dirty the band wanted the guitars to sound; [...] "for the most part, I just sort of stood back and let them go at it". Guitarist Steve <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> that the band selected two of their [...] "grungiest" [...] songs for the single. [...] "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" [...] was to be the A-side of the single and [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] the B-side before, in drummer Dan Peters's words, [...] "that all got flipped around".|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Turner {{asserted}} on PBS's Charlie Rose {{television program}} that if steps are not taken to address global warming, {{most people would}} die and [...] "the rest {{of us will be}} cannibals". <b>Turner</b> also <b>said</b> in the interview that he advocated Americans having no more than two children.

500|$|Although the {{introduction}} of two planes and the turning button were considered good ideas in theory, both features were heavily criticized by reviewers. Jeremy Dunham of IGN, Manny LaMancha of GamePro and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy felt it difficult to fight one-on-one when a player can start a cat-and-mouse game, while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin and Brian Gee of Game Revolution found the features to cause [...] "chaos". <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> it deprived the player of the ability [...] "to have a normal Guilty Gear X2-style match", and Dunham said the computer reacted faster. David Smith of 1UP.com called it an [...] "irrational control scheme". The perceived poor execution of its new features led GameSpy {{to give it a}} special [...] "It Sounded Good on Paper" [...] award.|$|E
500|$|Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, {{the single}} [...] "Leave Before the Lights Come On", came on 14 August 2006. <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> that {{the song was}} one of the last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and {{suggested}} that [...] "it feels very much like it could be on the album". Peaking at No.4 in the UK, the single became the band's first single not to reach No.1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former bandmates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later.|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 season, {{political}} {{discussions were}} {{common in the}} Maryland locker room because of the presidential election. Turner and fellow quarterback Jordan Steffy, a conservative and supporter of presidential candidate Senator John McCain, were the most frequent debaters, while defensive tackle Dean Muhtadi was described as the primary instigator. During the summer of 2009, Turner held an internship on Capitol Hill working for Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader and Maryland's fifth district congressman. Turner had previously considered volunteering for the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, which he said probably annoyed his conservative father, John Turner. Describing his experience during the internship, <b>Turner</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's funny to compare how serious politics is and how serious football is. Depending on who you talk to, they're both pretty big deals... There's {{more to life than}} football." ...|$|E
2500|$|The four {{nominees for}} the Tate gallery's 2009 Turner Prize were Enrico David, Roger Hiorns, Lucy Skaer and Richard Wright [...] The award went to Richard Wright on 7 December 2009 winning him the £25,000 prize ($41,000, 28,000 EUR). The <b>Turner</b> jury <b>said</b> in a {{statement}} that they [...] "admired the profound originality and beauty of Wright's work." [...] The other shortlisted nominees each won £5,000.|$|R
50|$|Glen Cove has {{relatively}} large lots. Robert Hamlin of Martha <b>Turner</b> Properties <b>said</b> that Glen Cove {{was one of}} the few neighborhoods with large lots that also has deed restrictions. The lot sizes on Glen Cove, Glenwood, Terrace, and some other streets tend to be larger, ranging from 19000 sq ft to 40000 sq ft, while lot sizes on Blossom, Camellia, Feagan, Floyd, and Rose streets tend to be smaller.|$|R
50|$|Serving on the Armed Services Committee, Turner had {{advocated}} for an expansion to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, providing {{testimony to the}} Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). This effort proved successful in 2008, when the Air Force announced that 1,000 jobs and over $230 million in federal funding would move to Wright-Patterson AFB. <b>Turner</b> has <b>said</b> {{that this is the}} largest single investment in Wright-Patterson since World War II.|$|R
500|$|In November 2014, LaBeouf {{stated that}} a woman had [...] "stripped [...] {{clothing}} and proceeded to rape [...] " [...] the previous February during the trio's #IAMSORRY performance in Los Angeles, while Rönkkö and Turner clarified that they had prevented the assault by intervening {{as soon as they}} were aware of the incident starting to occur. In response to Piers Morgan's questions on Twitter as to why the woman was not detained, Turner stated that she ran out before it was clear precisely what had happened, and that the first priority had been to ensure everybody's safety in the gallery. When later asked whether they regretted not having a code of conduct for participants during the exhibit, <b>Turner</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I don’t think you need a notice on the wall saying 'Do not murder the artist'." ...|$|E
500|$|Fifth-year senior Turner {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} uncontested starter at quarterback {{for the first time}} in his career. He was backed-up by sophomore Jamarr Robinson and true freshmen C. J. Brown and Danny O'Brien. Turner's {{seniority}} was called critical for the performance of the team's relatively youthful offensive line. Head coach Friedgen said, [...] "If I had to choose between a veteran offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback, or an inexperienced line with a veteran quarterback, I think I'd go with the veteran quarterback." [...] Upon the conclusion of preseason camp, the coaching staff praised his progress, particularly his game-planning, for which he had been criticized in the past. <b>Turner</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mentally, I am way further ahead than where I was last year." [...] Physically, he dropped 16 pounds by adding muscle and losing body fat, and weighed 220 pounds before the start of the season. Offensive coordinator Franklin said, [...] "You look at him, he was kind of mushy last year. You look at him now and he's muscular and shaped. He looks more athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|Grunge {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in the United Kingdom after Pavitt and Poneman asked journalist Everett True from the British magazine Melody Maker to write {{an article on the}} local music scene. This exposure helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s and drew more people to local shows. The appeal of grunge to the music press was that it [...] "promised the return to a notion of a regional, authorial vision for American rock". Grunge's popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to Seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands. Mudhoney's Steve <b>Turner</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It was really bad. Pretend bands were popping up here, things weren't coming from where we were coming from." [...] As a reaction, many grunge bands diversified their sound, with Nirvana and Tad in particular creating more melodic songs. Dawn Anderson of the Seattle fanzine Backlash recalled that by 1990 many locals had tired of the hype surrounding the Seattle scene and hoped that media exposure had dissipated.|$|E
50|$|Turner {{travelled}} to Cairns in {{far north}} Queensland {{at the age}} of 15 to record the track with producer David Lynch for M.E.L. Productions. Once there, he laid down the vocals, beat and guitars while DubLT recorded his rap verse on a $20 microphone back in Brisbane. <b>Turner</b> has <b>said</b> that he originally tried using a real beat for the song, but subsequently chose to replace it with beatboxing.|$|R

500|$|Beatles biographer Bill Harry {{wrote that}} Lennon began drawing and writing creatively {{at an early}} age with the {{encouragement}} of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> that Lennon [...] "had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine, [...] "the mine {{was at the end of}} Wigan Pier." [...] Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, [...] "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, [...] "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog—also wearing glasses".|$|E
500|$|In June 1963 in US media, Honda {{began the}} 12-year-long {{advertising}} campaign [...] "You meet the nicest {{people on a}} Honda", created by Grey Advertising. Grey had bought the idea from a UCLA undergraduate student, who had created the concept for a class assignment. The event {{marked the beginning of}} the decline of domestic and British motorcycle brands in the US market, and the rise of Honda and the other Japanese companies. In December 1965, Edward <b>Turner</b> <b>said</b> the sale of small Japanese motorcycles was good for BSA, by attracting new riders who would graduate to larger machines, not anticipating that the Japanese would advance over the next 5 years to directly threaten British bikes with technically sophisticated models such as the Honda CB750, and the Kawasaki Z1. As a case study in business and marketing, the campaign is still remembered half a century later, with one strategic management textbook saying, [...] "Honda and the Supercub is probably the best known and most debated case in business strategy." [...] It was credited with having [...] "invented the concept of lifestyle marketing." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] <b>Turner</b> <b>said.</b> While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil sent us a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with {{what we were trying to}} say on this record,” said Maida.|$|E
5000|$|Greg <b>Turner</b> of Allmusic <b>said</b> [...] "Bartz's strong tone, {{sense of}} swing, and improvisational {{imagination}} place him {{within the ranks}} of jazz's finest saxophonists, and he proves it throughout this recording... Shadows is an excellent addition to Bartz's extensive discography".|$|R
5000|$|Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge is {{the second}} studio album by the grunge band Mudhoney.

5000|$|Before a white militia could {{organize}} and respond, the rebels killed 60 men, women, and children. They spared a few homes [...] "because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves {{than they did}} of negros.'" [...] Turner also thought that revolutionary violence would serve to awaken the attitudes of whites {{to the reality of}} the inherent brutality in slave-holding. <b>Turner</b> later <b>said</b> that he wanted to spread [...] "terror and alarm" [...] among whites.|$|R
