Red and Blue play the following game, starting with a family F ⊆ S. Red chooses two crossing sets X, Y in the current F and replace them by sets X′, Y′ ∈ S such that either X′ = X ∩ Y,Y′ = X ∪ Y or X′ = X − Y,Y′ = Y − X. Then Blue returns one of X, Y to F. The game terminates (and Red wins) when F no longer contains crossing sets. Hurkens et al. (1987) considers a similar game which, being reformulated in our terms, deals with S consisting of all sets X ⊂V) such that ¦tholitss,ttholits ∩ X¦ = 1, given s,t ∈ V. It was shown there that Red can win in time polynomial in ¦V¦ and ¦F¦. Extending that result, we develop an algorithm for Red to win, in polynomial time, for an arbitrary symmetric cross-closed S. Also a polynomial algorithm for a certain weighted version of the game is given. The key idea of both methods is that the whole problem can be split into a polynomial number of problems, each dealing with a cyclic family — a family of which members correspond to partitions of a cycle into two connected parts. The results have applications in combinatorial optimization, e. g., when we deal with packing problems on certain cuts of a graph, such as <b>T-cuts,</b> directed cuts, etc., and desire to transform a given optimal packing into another one which is free of crossing cuts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In partitioning, clustering, and {{grouping}} problems, {{a typical}} {{goal is to}} group together similar objects, or pixels {{in the case of}} image processing. At the same time, another goal is to have each group distinctly dissimilar from the rest and possibly to have the group size fairly large. These goals are often combined as a ratio optimization problem. One example of such a problem is a variant of the normalized cut problem, another is the ratio regions problem. We devise here the first polynomial time algorithms solving optimally the ratio region problem and the variant of normalized cut, as well as a few other ratio problems. The algorithms are efficient and combinatorial, in contrast with nonlinear continuous approaches used in the image segmentation literature, which often employ spectral techniques. Such techniques deliver solutions in real numbers which are not feasible to the discrete partitioning problem. Furthermore, these continuous approaches are computationally expensive compared to the algorithms proposed here. The algorithms presented here use as a subroutine a minimum s; <b>t-cut</b> procedure on a related graph which is of polynomial size. The output consists of the optimal solution to the respective ratio problem, as well as a sequence of nested solutions with respect to any relative weighting of the objectives of the numerator and denominator.
