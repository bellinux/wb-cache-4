500|$|Ronnie Dunn, {{with whom}} McBride collaborated {{when he wrote}} songs for Brooks & Dunn, {{said that he was}} a fan of the band before McBride joined the duo's road band. In an {{interview}} with CMT, Dunn said, [...] "They're amazingly <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group. I first heard them on the radio in the early '90s, shortly after their first single. I liked Terry's singing style. It had a familiar Texas twang." [...] Dunn has also said that he enjoys writing with McBride, because both of them are Texas natives with a similar upbringing and musical influences.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{arrangements}} were developed through extensive jamming, with Cox's and Miles' playing influencing Hendrix's ideas. [...] According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Cox explained in later interviews, [...] "the process {{was based on}} building up rhythm patterns and that each pattern dictated the shape and character of {{a portion of a}} song in which it appeared". [...] Record producer Alan Douglas witnessed the approach during a jam at the Record Plant and saw it as inefficient. On the other hand, Shadwick feels that it was necessary: [...] "it seemed the only way available, especially as neither Cox nor Miles, in particular, were exactly swift on the musical uptake". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray noted, [...] "Cox's funky, uncluttered bass style would give Hendrix's new music a more solid, less frenetic underpinning [...] [...] In every way, Cox's function would be to provide the steadiness Hendrix so urgently required". [...] Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt described Miles' style as [...] "pleasantly messy... He wasn't as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Stax drummer ... his rolls would clatter about a bit". [...] However, his often described [...] "fatback grooves" [...] lay down a solid rhythmic foundation and the combination of Cox and Miles adds a [...] "heavy, rolling fluidity which brings out a very different dimension in Hendrix's playing".|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave Zooropa an [...] "A", {{calling it}} [...] "harried, spontaneous-sounding, and {{ultimately}} exhilarating album". Browne {{noted that it}} sounds [...] "messy" [...] and [...] "disconnected", but clarified [...] "that sense of incoherence is the point" [...] {{in the context of}} the record's technology themes. He concluded, [...] "For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it [...] "captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour" [...] so much so that [...] "it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour" [...] and yet sounds like a [...] "souvenir" [...] of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a [...] "creative stretch", noting that the band experiments more yet retains their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's [...] "yearning anthemic reach" [...] and [...] "obvious, slinky pop charm" [...] are replaced with [...] "darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a [...] "freewheeling feel of going with the flow" [...] throughout the album and calling it [...] "rootless and loose, restless and unsettled". For Du Noyer, U2 sounded [...] "monstrously <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> performing unit and fluidly inventive as composers, so the results transcend the merely experimental".|$|E

Strahorn recalled, [...] "As usual, I {{could not be}} denied {{the thrill of the}} charge of the by the gallant twenty-five, and I’m sure that everything worked out as planned, except that many of the Indians escaped into a thicket {{in the bottom of a}} narrow gulch running along within a few yards of the nearest tepee, while a few others got away into the hills. The Indians, finding themselves laced in their lodges, the leather drawn <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drum in the heavy rain, quickly cut themselves out with their knives and returned fire. [...] Many were seen to fall, and even in the approaching daylight it was often tell whether the burdens carried were children or the slain and wounded. [...] The squaws carried the dead, wounded and children up the opposite bluffs, leaving everything but their limited nightclothes in our possession. Most of the Indians fled splashing through the swollen creek and scrabbling into the heavy underbrush south of the stream bed and up the adjacent bluffs, taking advantage of Mill’s failure to secure an effective cordon southwest of the tipis.|$|E
