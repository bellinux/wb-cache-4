6000|$|It was my <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>him</b> squarely. I did so and {{mentioned}} the amount I could dispose of. And I perceived {{that he was}} disappointed.

50|$|Torresola {{approached}} Blair House, {{located on}} Pennsylvania Avenue, {{from the west}} side, while Collazo walked up behind Capitol police officer, Donald Birdzell, who {{was standing on the}} steps of the Blair House.

50|$|The {{most famous}} story {{recollection}} of the Noppera-bō comes from Lafcadio Hearn's book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things titled Mujina. The {{story of a man}} who travelled along the Akasaka road to Edo, he came across a young woman in a remote location near Kunizaka hill, crying and forlorn. After attempting to console the young woman and offer assistance, she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>him,</b> startling him with the blank countenance of a faceless ghost. Frightened, the man proceeded down the road for some time, until he came across a soba vendor. Stopping to relax, the man told the vendor of his tale, only to recoil in horror as the soba vendor stroked his face, becoming a noppera-bō himself. It turns out that all of these noppera-bō were really just mujina in disguise.|$|E

They all dived below for safety, and on impact the rover destroyed the structure they were building, much to the Clangers' annoyance. They all observed the rover, staying just out of its sight. When it began to dig - and seemingly eat - some of the surface, Major Clanger intervened and stopped it. It then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>him</b> and they attempted to shake hands, at which point the Rover's [...] "nose" [...] came off in Major Clanger's hand. He tries to return it, but the Rover drives off, finds a suitable bit of ground, then launches itself back into space. Major Clanger exclaims that it is [...] "Marvellous".|$|E
50|$|The second scene, {{in which}} Tarzan {{is forced to}} fight a lion, starts with the ape man being forced {{to run away from}} a hunting lion, Belthar, which will hunt him down and kill him. Tarzan at first {{believes}} he can outrun the beast (lions tire after the first 100 yards at top speed). This lion, however, is of a breed specifically selected for endurance, and ultimately Tarzan must <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>him,</b> though aware that without a knife he can do little but delay the inevitable. Fortunately his own lion ally, Jad-bal-ja, whom he had raised from a cub, arrives and intervenes, killing Belthar and saving Tarzan.

5000|$|Juliet kissed Pepe. Their kiss lingered. Pepe {{came up for}} air. 'Tim'. As I {{kissed her}} she opened her mouth. Her tongue was {{exploring}} mine. I felt trapped.

I caught sight of his face - fresh, with chocolate-brown eyes, and a small, almost undetectable smile. 74 ...|$|E

50|$|Choreography and {{blocking}} is, of course, entirely dependent on {{production and the}} capabilities of the set. In London, as the other characters cleared the stage to follow Poppa looking for Rusty and Pearl, a scene change was suggested by Pearl, sat on a railway buffer, pushed onstage behind them. From this perch she started singing. As the passion in the song built, she stood and skated around. In other productions without mobile set pieces, Pearl kneels to start her song. At Rusty's entrance, Pearl turns away from him, she can't immediately <b>face</b> <b>him</b> from shame at how she's hurt him. But the spoken lines give her the confidence <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>to</b> skate with him, before finishing with their fisted hands touching, to show that they are 'coupled'. This gesture is also used by Pearl and Dinah in the coaches dialogue in the beginning of 'Freight', as the coaches are teaming up against the Trucks. Volta and Joule also use this gesture after the final race, though sometimes they high-five. Rusty and Pearl's edition involves a hug, and sometimes a kiss, resulting in a more romantic suggestion.|$|R

Kilgus recognized the Vietnamese pilot was pulling him into a game of chicken as both jets hurtled down toward {{the waters of the}} Gulf of Tonkin and the lighter MiG should have been able pull out of a dangerous dive more quickly. Now headed nearly straight down, Kilgus armed his guns and took aim at the spot projected on the glass of his A4 radar-ranging gunsight.
