5|$|The PIP and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The lethality of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> up and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Rams, who {{had been}} hobbled by {{injuries}} much of the season, entered the playoffs with the worst record (9–7) of the six division winners. Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood played {{the game with a}} hairline fracture of his left leg, and Vince Ferragamo continued to start in place of the injured Pat Haden. On {{the other side of the}} ball, the Buccaneers lost Lee Roy Selmon and Cecil Johnson with ankle injuries, Doug Williams with a torn bicep, and Wally Chambers with a knee injury. Mike Washington and Dave Lewis also missed part of the game with injuries. The game was the Rams' second consecutive playoff win against a team that had beaten them decisively during the regular season. Each team had a touchdown called back due to a penalty. The Rams also had a touchdown called back when it was ruled that receiver Preston Dennard did not maintain possession of the ball. The Rams offensive line was intact, unlike in the regular-season matchup. This provided for 216 yards rushing and gave Ferragamo much time to complete passes. Another change from the earlier game was that Wendell Tyler had become the starting halfback for the Rams. With Tyler's speed enabling the Rams to run outside, the Buccaneers were no longer able <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> the inside lanes with defenders and put the linebackers into coverage on passing downs. The Buc defense's focus on Tyler freed Cullen Bryant to run for 106 yards on 18 carries. Meanwhile, Buc quarterbacks Williams and Mike Rae were 4–26 on pass attempts. It took until the third quarter for the Buccaneers to even pass midfield, on a halfback option pass from Jerry Eckwood to Larry Mucker.|$|E
25|$|The Ruger Mini-14 {{was seen}} {{extensively}} in many episodes of The A-Team, an NBC television series that aired from 1983 to 1987. It {{was chosen because}} of its reputation for reliably firing blanks, which tend <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> a gun's action.|$|E
40|$|Various {{configurations}} of porous, perforated and slotted materials were flow tested {{to determine if}} they would meet the LFC surface smoothness and flow requirements.

25|$|Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only 3 lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy rush hour delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US 1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and ride-sharing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated model of substrate clogging in a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW). The model simulates {{the reduction of}} pore space in the wetland substrate due to combined influences of various physical, biogeochemical and plant-related processes. A series of experiments based on laboratory-scale VFCWs were conducted to examine and measure key parameters related <b>to</b> <b>clogging</b> of the wetland substrate during operation under different conditions. The model was then validated using data collected from the experiments. The {{results showed that the}} model was able <b>to</b> replicate the <b>clogging</b> phenomenon as observed in the experiments, in particular, the characteristic clogging time. The model also predicted well individual contributions <b>to</b> <b>clogging</b> by accumulated inert suspended solids, microbial biomass and plant root materials during the wetland operation. Although the validation was based on the laboratory data, the results indicated that the model describes well the processes underlying the clogging and has the potential to become a tool for assessing the performance of prototype CWs in relation <b>to</b> <b>clogging</b> at both the design and operation stages...|$|R

25|$|The fishery of Antarctic krill is on {{the order}} of 100,000tonnes per year. The major {{catching}} nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs to have very fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> very fast.|$|E
25|$|A {{class action}} suit was filed in 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, {{on behalf of}} {{consumers}} in Ohio that purchased Target-brand wet wipes. The lawsuit filed against Target Corporation alleges the retailer misled consumers by marking the packaging on its up & up® brand wipes as flushable and safe for sewer and septic systems. The lawsuit also alleges that so-called flushable wipes are a public health hazard because they are alleged <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> pumps at municipal waste-treatment facilities.|$|E
25|$|Krill {{are small}} animals, {{considered}} {{a type of}} zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with fine-meshed plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> fast, and they have high drag, producing a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Trawling must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish fingerlings, which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.|$|E

40|$|Permeable {{concrete}} is used {{to reduce}} local flooding in urban areas. However, it is prone <b>to</b> <b>clogging</b> by particulate matter and requires regular maintenance. This paper reports {{on the performance of}} permeable concrete exposed <b>to</b> different <b>clogging</b> test methods <b>to</b> further understand this complex phenomena. New methods were developed <b>to</b> study the <b>clogging</b> effect and <b>to</b> define a <b>clogging</b> potential. The tests involve applying flowing water containing sand and/or clay in cycles through the sample and measuring the change in flow rate. Clogging depends on the applied solution and exposure method used. Significant permeability reductions were observed in all samples, particularly when simultaneously exposed to sand and clay. This is because flocculated clay adhered to surface of sand particles and this caused increased clogging...|$|R
25|$|The {{potential}} for silt from eroded Adirondack slopes <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> the Erie Canal {{had led the}} state's business community to rally {{for the creation of}} the Forest Preserve in 1885. A legislative maneuver by the Ulster County delegation later that year added the Catskills, relieving the county of property tax obligations to the state on lands it had taken by foreclosure after the tanners and loggers had harvested everything of value and absconded with the revenue. The lands transferred to the state by the legislation were required to be kept forever wild. The legislation became Article 14 of the state constitution nine years later, in 1894, with added provisos that prohibited their sale, lease or any other transfer without a new amendment authorizing such a transaction.|$|E
25|$|Older {{furnaces}} {{may contain}} rubber parts {{that would be}} affected by biodiesel's solvent properties, but can otherwise burn biodiesel without any conversion required. Care must be taken, however, given that varnishes left behind by petrodiesel will be released and can clog pipes- fuel filtering and prompt filter replacement is required. Another approach is to start using biodiesel as a blend, and decreasing the petroleum proportion over time can allow the varnishes to come off more gradually and be less likely <b>to</b> <b>clog.</b> Thanks to its strong solvent properties, however, the furnace is cleaned out and generally becomes more efficient. A technical research paper describes laboratory research and field trials project using pure biodiesel and biodiesel blends as a heating fuel in oil-fired boilers.|$|E
25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the upper gate fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the lock chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, so there would be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The upper gate is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the upper gate recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> the opening.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} leg in Bordeaux, Claude Puel {{opted for a}} more {{defensive}} formation starting Maxime Gonalons ahead of the attack-minded Miralem Pjanić. The strategy was successful {{during the early stages}} but turned sour following an accurate shot from midfielder Alou Diarra, which again beat Lloris, but, for the second straight match, hit the post in the 43rd minute. Two minutes later, just before halftime, Bordeaux drew within one goal following a conversion from Chamakh. In the second half, Puel remained confident in defense opting to substitute out attacker and lone striker Bafétimbi Gomis in order <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> the midfield. In the final stages of the match, Bordeaux were near the game-winning goal following a header attempt by Wendel, but their hopes were spoiled following an amazing save from Lloris. Though Bordeaux were successful in attaining a victory, the 3–2 aggregate scoreline was in Lyon's favor allowing the club to advance to their first-ever UEFA Champion's League semi-final.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E
25|$|Justice Edmund Pendleton of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals died on October 23, 1803, and on January 6, 1804, the Virginia Assembly {{appointed}} Tucker to {{the state}} Supreme Court of Appeals (known since 1970 as the Virginia Supreme Court), choosing him over Archibald Stuart of Staunton {{by a vote of}} 115-82. By this time, Tucker was known for writing extremely thorough opinions that analyzed numerous angles on every issue involved in the case; however, unlike many of his colleagues on the Court of Appeals, he would not deliver his opinions in seriatim if he felt a single, unified court opinion would do. In 1808, Tucker crafted another piece of proposed legislation that would have greatly reduced the number of mandatory appeals a party was entitled to, both in an effort to reduce the Court of Appeals's caseload and to curtail what Tucker saw as pointless delay tactics by parties that only served <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> the court system.
