5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft, which Conley {{said he had}} left there before the murder. Use of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an indication that <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{could not have been}} used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>{{elevator}}</b> is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E

5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} <b>elevators.</b> <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> are <b>the</b> second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> of <b>the</b> South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch <b>the</b> three <b>elevators</b> to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling <b>elevator</b> without injuring <b>the</b> passengers inside.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> stop at {{only two}} levels, surface and {{platform}} level, with no intermediate stops. As {{a part of}} the station's geological theme, the signs inside <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> refer to these two levels not by conventional floor numbers but by [...] "the present" [...] and [...] "16 million years ago"—for the surface level and platform level, respectively. During ascent and descent, a moving indicator display inside each <b>elevator</b> shows <b>the</b> current position expressed as elevation above sea level in feet. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> allow selecting two floors, [...] "S" [...] and [...] "T", for [...] "surface" [...] and [...] "tunnel" [...] (or possibly [...] "street" [...] and [...] "track"). The 26-story (28 for <b>the</b> west <b>elevators)</b> equivalent ride takes about 25 seconds. Due to the hillside surface slope, <b>the</b> west <b>elevators</b> are 20 ft taller than <b>the</b> east <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited the west side of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> for their trip back down.|$|E
5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|At {{the auto}} shop, Shannon offers {{to hide the}} money, but the Driver refuses. He hunts down Cook in a strip club, smashes his fingers with a hammer, threatens to kill him, and force-feeds him the bullet {{that was given to}} Benicio. Cook reveals that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver decides to return the money, but Nino dismisses the offer and instead sends a hit man to the Driver's {{apartment}} building. Entering <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> with Irene, the Driver encounters the hit man. He then kisses Irene, and brutally beats the hit man to death. Afterwards, Irene leaves <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> stunned and horrified.|$|E

50|$|In the canard arrangement, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> are {{hinged to}} the rear of a {{foreplane}} and move in the opposite sense, for example when the pilot pulls the stick back <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> go down to increase the lift at the front and lift the nose up.|$|R
50|$|To {{achieve their}} top speed, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> in <b>the</b> Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre use {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors. The air pressure is adjusted {{in order to}} prevent ear blockages and <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> have rollers to smoothen the ride. Additionally, the emergency brakes can withstand temperatures up to 300 C. Besides <b>the</b> two fastest <b>elevators,</b> <b>the</b> building has 28 double-deck elevators (with speeds of 150-450 m/min.), 13 high-speed elevators (210-600 m/min.), and 52 medium- and low-speed <b>elevators.</b> <b>The</b> designers chose for double-deck elevators in order to minimize <b>the</b> number of <b>elevator</b> shafts. <b>The</b> offices, apartments, and the hotel all have separate elevators.|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, 1957, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) began {{allowing}} free {{public access}} to <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> at <b>the</b> 181st and 190th Street stations. Though <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> were intended for subway riders, local residents paid the subway fare to avoid climbing about eight stories up Fort Washington Hill. Bills were proposed in the New York State Legislature to put <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> out of fare control, but these failed in committee. The NYCTA agreed once Joseph Zaretzki, the local State Senator, requested the change.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> {{in each of}} the {{residence}} halls are divided based on a low rise and high rise system. In Morrill, <b>the</b> low rise <b>elevators</b> go to floors 1, 3-14 and <b>the</b> high rise <b>elevators</b> goes to floors 1,3, 15-23. Only authorized officials can access floor 2 using <b>the</b> <b>elevators.</b> In Lincoln, low rise elevators reach floors 1-14, while high rise elevators reach floors 1,2, and 15-23. Each side of the building has 3 elevators.|$|R
50|$|The MB.160 had {{conventional}} empennage, with <b>the</b> tailplane and <b>elevators</b> mounted near <b>the</b> {{top of the}} fuselage. Together, {{they were}} tapered and round tipped; <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> like <b>the</b> rudder, had trim tabs. The latter was straight-edged and balanced. Though it extended to the keel, it was hinged non-vertically so was far enough back to clear <b>the</b> <b>elevators.</b> <b>The</b> fin was essentially triangular. All the rear surfaces had steel internal structures rather {{like those of the}} wing.|$|R

5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he scanned the area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt.

50|$|The {{tail unit}} was metal framed and fabric covered. The {{tailplane}} was externally braced and <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> carried trim tabs. The fin was straight edged but the rudder, which {{extended to the}} bottom of the fuselage and worked in a cut-out between <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> had a full, curved trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|Inside the {{building}} are 10 high-speed <b>elevators</b> installed by <b>the</b> Otis <b>Elevator</b> Company. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> were among <b>the</b> {{first to use}} the company's electronic control system, the Otis Autotronic system.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> to the Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E

5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
5|$|Inside <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
