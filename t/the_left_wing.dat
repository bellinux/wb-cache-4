5|$|Arsenal {{lined up}} in a 4–4–2 formation; Eddie McGoldrick was {{included}} in the matchday squad, while Kevin Campbell partnered Ian Wright up front. Ferguson deployed a 4–2–4 formation, with Paul Ince partnering debutant Keane in the midfield two. Andrei Kanchelskis was picked in favour of Lee Sharpe on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Craig Robert Nelthorpe (born 10 June 1987) is an English semi-professional footballer {{who plays}} for Northern Premier League Division One North club Scarborough Athletic. His favoured {{positions}} are either at left back or on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents. The right wing marched across level ground {{straight}} towards the Persian camp, whilst <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground. The right wing thus began fighting with the Persians while <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Khalid, {{aware of}} the {{situation}} at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of <b>the</b> Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of <b>the</b> Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> while <b>the</b> Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three-pronged attack forced <b>the</b> Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> to abandon <b>the</b> Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round.|$|R

5|$|According to Diodorus, the Macedonian army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians. Philip took {{command of the}} right wing of the Macedonian army and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future conqueror of the Persian Empire) in command of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal {{but could not}} convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E

25|$|A post-incident {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} the aircraft had suffered damage to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing's</b> leading edge slats, ailerons and flaps. Despite the incident, CAL FIRE stated that they were happy with the aircraft. The aircraft returned to the sky for a test flight after repairs on July 30, 2007.|$|R
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back.|$|E
5|$|Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren had {{not even}} sat down when his team took the lead. Mendieta's pass let Zenden run down <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> and cross for striker Joseph-Désiré Job to put Middlesbrough ahead in the second minute. It was the fastest goal scored in a final, a record broken the {{following}} year by Liverpool's John Arne Riise.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> slats to retract, which caused a stall over <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b> In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the French had {{occupied}} in force some fullering mill buildings within musket {{shot of the}} Russian right wing. Russian jagers ejected the French. Both sides escalated the fight, with the Russians assaulting <b>the</b> French <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> on Windmill Knoll to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of Eylau. Napoleon interpreted the Russian efforts on his left {{as a prelude to}} an attack on Eylau from that quarter. By this time Davout's III Corps began to arrive on <b>the</b> Russian <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{battle lines}} of the Muslims and the Byzantines were divided into four sections: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> the left center, the right center and the right wing. Note that the {{descriptions}} of the Muslim and the Byzantine battle lines are exactly each other's opposite, i.e.: so the Muslim right wing faced the Byzantine left wing (see image).|$|E
5|$|When the teamsheets were released, Wenger's {{selection}} showed Dennis Bergkamp as {{the preferred}} striking partner to Henry; Reyes was positioned on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> which meant Robert Pirès started the match on the substitutes' bench. For Manchester United, {{there was no}} place for Keane in the squad, so Ferguson brought in Phil Neville to partner Paul Scholes in central midfield.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

5|$|Anders Limpar was {{the main}} {{absentee}} for Arsenal, having sustained a knee injury, on duty for the Swedish national team. David O'Leary started {{in place of the}} injured Steve Bould; midfielder David Hillier was selected ahead of Michael Thomas in Limpar's place on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b> Tottenham defender Terry Fenwick, recovered from a double leg break, replaced Justin Edinburgh in the first eleven. Without Paul Gascoigne, injured in the FA Cup final, Tottenham employed a five-man midfield with Gary Lineker as the sole striker.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas. As the match entered injury time {{at the end of}} the second half, Ronaldo made yet another run down <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> outpacing Lauren to Rooney's through-ball. The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal, but his shot went over the bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made its way across the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{was without}} injured trio Robert Pirès, Freddie Ljungberg and Giovanni van Bronckhorst and {{lined up in}} their {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation; striker Sylvain Wiltord was accommodated to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> with Bergkamp playing off main striker Thierry Henry. After a lengthy illness, Liverpool defender Markus Babbel returned to the squad and was named as a substitute. Houllier deployed a 4–3–1–2 formation with Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise and Dietmar Hamann as a midfield three and new signing, El Hadji Diouf positioned in a free role to begin with and as the game went on, moved to the right wing to stretch Arsenal's defence.|$|E

50|$|Frederick's {{plan was}} to envelop the Austrian right wing with most of his army. Along the Austrian lines (Prussian right wing and center) he kept only enough troops to hide the {{concentration}} on <b>the</b> Prussian <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b> <b>The</b> Prussian main force would turn right toward the Austrians to attack their right flank. <b>The</b> Prussian <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> would locally outnumber the Austrians. After the Austrian right wing was defeated the battle would be decided.|$|R
50|$|Ault was {{embroiled in}} the bitter 1909 State Convention of the Socialist Party of Washington, leaving with <b>the</b> {{minority}} <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> delegation headed by Hermon Titus. Although <b>the</b> bolting <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> attempted {{to form a}} parallel State Committee and hold a referendum of Washington Socialists to determine {{the legitimacy of the}} competing claimants, the governing National Executive Committee of the SPA intervened, ruling the referendum illegal and recognizing the moderate-dominated regular convention.|$|R
5|$|Guiscard, however, {{had been}} {{informed}} of Alexios' arrival by his scouts {{and on the}} night of October 17, he moved his army from the peninsula to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard's move, Alexios revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> under the command of Gregory Pakourianos, the right wing under the command of Nikephoros Melissenos, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios's, with the right wing under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre.|$|E
5|$|He is {{predominantly}} a left footed player. During a match he will often drift to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> with his teammate, {{in the case}} of Bayern Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another factor in his playing style is his relationship with the right-fullback. At Bayern, this partnership with Philipp Lahm has had benefits for the team's efficiency and chemistry. Robben's defensive work improved when he went to Bayern where he often tracks back and covers for his partner when he pushes forward and becomes a temporary right back.|$|E
5|$|Henderson {{established}} himself as a full-time NHL player in 1964–65, though with limited ice time. He was used primarily in a defensive role and to kill penalties, scoring 8 goals and 21 points, while appearing in 70 games. Switching to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> in 1965–66, Henderson played a more offensive role and scored 22 goals. He added three more in 12 playoff games as the Red Wings reached the 1966 Stanley Cup Final versus the Montreal Canadiens. Henderson scored the game-winning goal in {{the first game of the}} finals. After winning the first two games in Montreal, Detroit lost four straight and the series.|$|E
