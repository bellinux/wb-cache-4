25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the <b>top</b> <b>sieve.</b> Above the <b>top</b> <b>sieve</b> a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the sieves have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet sieving it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{pyranose}} oxidase (P 2 O), glucose oxidase (GO) and H 2 O 2 on gluten agglomeration during wheat flour gluten-starch separation was studied. Analysis of gluten aggregate sizes in batter formed from wheat flour dough revealed that increasing levels of oxidising agents gradually decreased {{the tendency of}} gluten proteins to form large gluten aggregates. Low enzyme levels increased arabinoxylan (AX) and starch retention on the sieves, due to physical incorporation of AX and starch in the gluten aggregates. Higher enzyme levels increased retention of starch and AX on the smaller and larger sieves, respectively. Extensive oxidation leads to physical incorporation of AX and starch granules in the small gluten aggregates. AX is also crosslinked and hence more easily retained on the <b>top</b> <b>sieves.</b> Our results confirm {{that the size of}} gluten aggregates and the level of AX crosslinking and AX and starch incorporation in gluten proteins depend on the concentration of H 2 O 2. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Prior to use, the matcha {{often is}} forced through a sieve {{in order to}} break up clumps. There are special sieves {{available}} for this purpose, which usually are stainless steel and combine a fine wire mesh sieve and a temporary storage container. A special wooden spatula is used to force the tea through the sieve, or a small, smooth stone may be placed on <b>top</b> of the <b>sieve</b> and the device shaken gently.|$|R
50|$|The {{harvested}} cherries {{are usually}} sorted and cleaned, {{to separate the}} unripe, overripe and damaged cherries and to remove dirt, soil, twigs and leaves. This {{can be done by}} winnowing, which is commonly done by hand, using a large sieve. Any unwanted cherries or other material not winnowed away can be picked out from the <b>top</b> of the <b>sieve.</b> The ripe cherries can also be separated by flotation in washing channels close to the drying areas.|$|R

50|$|The grain, either {{coming through}} the concave or the walkers, meets a set of sieves mounted on an {{assembly}} called a shoe, which is shaken mechanically. The <b>top</b> <b>sieve</b> has larger openings, and serves to remove large pieces of chaff from the grain. The lower sieve separates clean grain, which falls through, from incompletely threshed pieces. The incompletely threshed grain is returned to the cylinder {{by means of a}} system of conveyors, where the process repeats.|$|E

40|$|Preserved, treated wood is {{commonly}} found in solid waste. Among {{the different types of}} preserved wood, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood recently has received much attention due to the scale of usage and its significant role in soil and water contamination. As the ash of CCA treated wood is hazardous, it cannot be burned, and the best available disposal method is thus landfilling. Leaching of the metals from disposed preserved wood in landfills pollutes the soil, water and the environment. The existing literature on leaching of CCA treated wood is reviewed, and several factors affecting leaching of the metals from wood, including pH of the leachant, temperature, the duration of leaching, the type of leachant are discussed. These factors affect each of the metals including chromium, copper and arsenic, differently. Definition and comparison of the effect of these mentioned factors on each preservative metal several experiments were performed. In all experiments ground wood (remaining at the <b>top</b> of <b>sieve</b> No. 10) was soaked in leachant (ratio 1 : 10). The leachants were nitric acid, sulfuric acid and acetic acid (0. 1 N), having pH values of 3, 4 and 5. They were left in an incubator for 5, 10 and 15 days. The temperature of the incubator was set to 15 C̕ for 15 days and then the experiment was repeated for temperatures 25 C̕ and 35 C̕. On the other hand to investigate the biodegradability of the leached wood, unleached wood and some of the leached wood samples were chosen. The necessary nutrients for growth of fungi and soil were added and the amount of generated CO 2 was measured through the experiment. The results of the experiments showed that sulfuric acid (pH 3) is the most effective leachant. Most of the leaching happens in the first 5 days and temperature increases the amount of leached metals. The leached CCA wood is still resistant to biodegradation...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} project aiming to develop {{management}} evaluation tools based on results from test-day (TD) models, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of physical composition of total mixed rations (TMR) tested quarterly from March 2006 through December 2008 on milk, fat, and protein yield curves for 25 herds in Ragusa, Sicily. A random regression sire-maternal grandsire model was used to estimate variance components for milk, fat, and protein yields fitted on a full data set, including 241, 153 TD records from 9, 809 animals in 42 herds recorded from 1995 through 2008. The model included parity, age at calving, year at calving, and stage of pregnancy as fixed effects. Random effects were herd × test date, sire and maternal grandsire additive genetic effect, and permanent environmental effect modeled using third-order Legendre polynomials. Model fitting was carried out using ASREML. Afterward, for the 25 herds involved in the study, 9 particle size classes were defined based on the proportions of TMR particles on the top (19 -mm) and middle (8 -mm) screen of the Penn State Particle Separator. Subsequently, the model with estimated variance components was used to examine the influence of TMR particle size class on milk, fat, and protein yield curves. An interaction was included with the particle size class and days in milk. The effect of the TMR particle size class was modeled using a ninth-order Legendre polynomial. Lactation curves were predicted from the model while controlling for TMR chemical composition (crude protein content of 15. 5 %, neutral detergent fiber of 40. 7 %, and starch of 19. 7 % for all classes), to have pure estimates of particle distribution not confounded by nutrient content of TMR. We found little effect of class of particle proportions on milk yield and fat yield curves. Protein yield was greater for sieve classes with 10. 4 to 17. 4 % of TMR particles retained on the <b>top</b> (19 -mm) <b>sieve.</b> Optimal distributions different from those recommended may reflect regional differences based on climate and types and quality of forages fed...|$|R
50|$|The Opti-Clean system {{optimize}} the strike and the throwing angles {{of each of}} the main components in CR9000 Elevation models. The grain pan is not coupled with the pre-sieve and <b>top</b> <b>sieve</b> so that each element can operate as its optimum efficiency. The cascade distance between the grain pan and the pre-sieve is increased for greater capacity, while a long sieve stroke and a steep throwing angle keep more material airborne, for even a higher cleaning efficiency. The opposing motion of the grain pan and bottom sieve to the pre-sieve reduces overall machine vibrations and increases operator comfort.|$|E
50|$|The Opti-Fan system {{compensates}} automatically {{for continuous}} uphill or downhill gradients in combines. When driving downhill, material moves against gravity {{and therefore more}} slowly over the grainpan and <b>top</b> <b>sieve,</b> causing it to remain longer in the cleaning shoe and the layer thickness to increase. More ‘material other than grain' (MOG) remains in the cleaning shoe as the set cleaning fan speed is insufficient to clear the crop. Driving uphill causes the material layer to decrease as it moves more quickly out of the shoe under gravity. The air flow from the fan is too high for the thin layer of material which results in the material travelling too quickly over the top causing increased grain losses. The fan speed control system senses the combine’s angle of ascent or descent and automatically adjusts the cleaning fan speed to compensate. The operator sets the level-field fan speed and the system reduces the speed when travelling uphill and increases it downhill to optimise the material layer thickness on the cleaning shoe.Opti-fan system was awarded with a Silver Medal at Agritechnica in 2009.|$|E
30|$|Soil texture was {{estimated}} using Hydrometer method. Samples were oven dried at 105 (°C) for 24 h, and BD was calculated as oven dried mass per core volume. Gravimetric moisture content was calculated as {{the ratio of}} weight of water to weight of oven dry soil. It is a weight fraction calculated as subtracting weight of oven dried soil from initial fresh sample weight divided by dry weight of the sample. Following the methods described by Hao et al. (2008), for dry aggregate stability estimation, each undisturbed sample was air dried for seven days, and carefully added to nests of sieves, with a pan underneath, having 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.25, and 0.053 mm size arranged from top to bottom, respectively, on the shaker apparatus. Each sample {{was added to the}} <b>top</b> <b>sieve</b> and subjected to shaking for 30 s (Hao et al. 2008). The remained fraction on each sieve was weighed using sensitive digital balance.|$|E
30|$|Drosophila melanogaster strains were {{separately}} collected into centrifuge tubes (50  ml), {{frozen in}} liquid nitrogen, and vigorously shaken to separate heads from bodies and extremities. Fly heads were isolated using pre-chilled size-exclusion sieves. The <b>top</b> <b>sieve</b> (Tyler equivalent 25 mesh#, 0.71  mm 2) allowed the heads to {{pass to the}} bottom sieve (Tyler equivalent 40 mesh#, 0.42  mm 2), which separated the extremities from the heads. The heads were collected and pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a pre-chilled mortar and pestle and then transferred to a micro-centrifuge tube. All samples were subjected to methanol/chloroform precipitation for protein extraction and purification according to a previously described protocol (Ericsson 1999) with slight modifications. Samples were suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 7  M urea, 2  M thiourea, and 4 % (w/v) 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]- 1 -propanesulfonate) followed by extraction with methanol, chloroform, and double-deionized water (ddH 2 O). Prior to adding each solution, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14, 000  rpm for 5  min. The top aqueous layer of all samples was discarded. Subsequently, samples were washed with methanol and centrifuged again at 14, 000  rpm for 5  min. Finally, {{as much of the}} top methanol layer as possible was removed, and samples were vacuum-dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Lysates were homogenized by injection through a 25 -gauge needle six times, and insoluble substances were removed by centrifugation at 14, 000  rpm at 4 °C for 30  min. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).|$|E
