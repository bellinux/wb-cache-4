5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges {{on the inside of the}} nasal cavity and a ridge at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E

5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight {{at all times}} can {{discourage}} the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cargo module.|$|E
