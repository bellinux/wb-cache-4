25|$|The band {{released}} their Swedish Grammy-winning {{debut album}} Supershitty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Max!</b> in 1996. Just before a tour opening for Kiss, the band recruited keyboardist and percussionist Anders Lindström (also known as Boba Fett or Boba) on a part-time basis; {{he would become}} a full-time member in 1999. After the album Payin' the Dues in 1998, Dregen left the band to return to Backyard Babies full-time, and Mattias Hellberg and Danne Andersson were recruited to complete the band touring responsibilities. After the release of Grande Rock, which featured additional guitar playing from both Lindström and Hellberg, Robert Dahlqvist {{was hired as a}} full-time lead guitarist in 1999. With the lineup now solidified, the band released three more studio albums and a cover album, with many EPs and limited edition releases as well.

The Djungarian hamster digs tunnels one metre deep leading to ground burrows {{where they can}} sleep, raise their young and hide from predators. The weasel {{is one of the}} Djungarian hamster's main predators. Most of these burrows have six entrances. In the summer, the burrows are lined with moss. To keep the burrow warm in the winter, the Djungarian hamster closes all but one entrance and lines the burrows with animal fur or wool that it finds.
