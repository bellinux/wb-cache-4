2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her.

2500|$|In their {{original}} publication, the memoirs {{were divided into}} twelve volumes, and the unabridged English translation by Willard R. Trask runs to more than 3,500 pages. Though his chronology is at times confusing and inaccurate, {{and many of his}} tales exaggerated, much of his narrative and many details are corroborated by contemporary writings. He has a good ear for dialogue and writes at length about all classes of society. Casanova, for the most part, is candid about his faults, intentions, and motivations, and shares his successes and failures with good humor. The confession is largely devoid of repentance or remorse. He celebrates the senses with his readers, especially regarding music, food, and women. [...] "I have always liked highly seasoned food. ... As for women, I have always found that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in love with smelled good, and the more copious her sweat the sweeter I found it." [...] He mentions over 120 adventures with women and girls, with several veiled references to male lovers as well. He describes his duels and conflicts with scoundrels and officials, his entrapments and his escapes, his schemes and plots, his anguish and his sighs of pleasure. He demonstrates convincingly, [...] "I can say vixi ('I have lived')." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{would say}} no more, and, greatly puzzled, I {{returned}} to my room in the palace and went to bed.

6000|$|May I {{illustrate}} this {{by a short}} example which happened very near me?

60|$|There were a {{thousand}} pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up any, for I couldn't remember {{how long a}} total eclipse lasts. I was in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think. Something was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling. If this wasn't <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> after, how was I to tell whether this was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream? Dear me, if I could only prove it was the latter!

60|$|Before {{entering}} the cabin I stood still, listening {{in the lobby}} {{at the foot of}} the stairs. A faint snore came through the closed door of the chief mate's room. The second mate's door was on the hook, but the darkness in there was absolutely soundless. He, too, was young and could sleep like a stone. Remained the steward, but he was not likely to wake up before he was called. I got a sleeping- suit out of my room and, coming back on deck, saw the naked man from the sea sitting on the main-hatch, glimmering white in the darkness, his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. In a moment he had concealed his damp body in a sleeping-suit of the same grey-stripe pattern as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wearing and followed me like my double on the poop. Together we moved right aft, barefooted, silent.|$|E

"There is {{one small}} {{point in the}} above {{narrative}} to which I would wish to call special attention, {{and that is the}} accurate description given by Mr. Mansfield of the umbrella carried by the apparition he observed in Oxford. This umbrella exactly coincided in every particular with <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> then actually carrying in Piccadilly. But what is truly remarkable, and what stamps the occurrence as a genuine case of supernatural intervention, is the fact that Mr. Mansfield could not possibly ever have seen that umbrella in my hands, because I had only just that afternoon purchased it at a shop in Bond Street. This, to my mind, conclusively proves that no mere effort of fancy or visual delusion based upon previous memories, vague or conscious, could have had anything whatsoever to do with Mr. Mansfield's observation at least. It was, in short, distinctly an objective apparition, as distinguished from a mere subjective reminiscence or hallucination." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{find the}} same doubts of our quality assail me when I turn to the supreme {{business}} of education.

60|$|So I avoided their looks, {{shrinking}} {{close to}} the kerbstone and by furtive glances directing my progress.

I do not know, save that there goes much dignity with dollars, and being devoid of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> destitute of the other. The person I sought practised a profession as ancient as the oracles but far more lucrative. It is mentioned in Exodus; so it must have been created soon after the foundations of the world; and despite the thunder of ecclesiastics and the mailed hand of kings and conquerors, it has endured even to this day. Nor is it unfair to presume that the accounts of this most remarkable business will not be closed until the Trumps of Doom are sounded and all things brought to final balance.|$|E
60|$|That is the essential. That is {{the stern}} {{condition}} laid upon all artists touching this luxury of fear. The terror must be fundamentally frivolous. Sanity may play with insanity; but insanity {{must not be}} allowed to play with sanity. Let such poets as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> reading in the garden, by all means, be free to imagine what outrageous deities and violent landscapes they like. By all means let them wander freely amid their opium pinnacles and perspectives. But these huge gods, these high cities, are toys; they must never for an instant be allowed to be anything else. Man, a gigantic child, must play with Babylon and Nineveh, with Isis and with Ashtaroth. By all means let him dream of the Bondage of Egypt, so long as he is free from it. By all means let him take up the Burden of Tyre, so long as he can take it lightly. But the old gods must be his dolls, not his idols. His central sanctities, his true possessions, should be Christian and simple. And just as a child would cherish most a wooden horse or a sword that is a mere cross of wood, so man, the great child, must cherish most the old plain things of poetry and piety; that horse of wood that was the epic end of Ilium, or that cross of wood that redeemed and conquered the world.|$|E
