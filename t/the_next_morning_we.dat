60|$|At {{four o'clock}} on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> started on our journey.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> {{were all}} envying his fortune; when, of a sudden, he bolted in upon us, looking decidedly out of humour.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past five when we boys got up <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>We</b> {{were joined}} {{on the stairs}} by Felicity, yawning and rosy.|$|E
6000|$|... "None whatever. He was {{perfectly}} satisfied. He stayed until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> and <b>we</b> parted friends. A {{few days ago}} I had his wedding cards. You know whom he married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to work <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>we</b> both dropt into the old groove; and nothing more was said until yesterday, when he {{informed}} me that you would come, today." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> before <b>we</b> had {{finished}} our breakfast, a messenger from the Agency {{came in to}} say that a carryall was at the door, and soon {{we were on our way}} toward the Fort.|$|R
60|$|This was {{our last}} {{excursion}} at Looe. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were {{again on the}} road, walking inland {{on our way to}} the town of Liskeard.|$|E
60|$|Early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> reached Nassau, {{the largest}} {{town in the}} Bahamas, {{on one of the}} {{smallest}} islands, and found it semi-tropical enough to suit even Mr. Chipperton.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{started for}} Fin-ma-Coul's Crossing. When I reached the shooting-box, where Guy was {{entertaining}} a select company of friends, Flora Billingsgate greeted {{me with a}} saucy smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove, so we will," [...] exclaimed my father; and <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> had <b>the</b> workmen in, {{and fixed}} {{up a little}} mound {{at the bottom of}} the orchard with a {{tombstone}} over it, bearing the following inscription:- ...|$|R
60|$|However, his {{warning was}} so short, {{that he could}} not reach to Stony-Stratford time enough to be with me at night, but he met me at a place called Brickhill <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>we</b> were just coming in to tow.|$|R
60|$|DOZING in our canoe <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> about daybreak, <b>we</b> were {{awakened by}} Zeke's hailing us loudly from the beach.|$|R
60|$|<b>THE</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were {{startled by}} an {{extraordinary}} proceeding {{on the part}} of one of the guests. Mr. Sax had left Carsham Hall by the first train--nobody knew why.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> girls {{set to work}} at our packing, and at luncheon Harry came in {{with the}} welcome news, that he had {{arranged}} everything most satisfactorily with Dr. Hooper.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{heard that}} Nips {{was in the}} surgeon's hands, with a bad wound in the fleshy part of his leg, and that the auger had NOT struck claret.|$|E
60|$|Here {{then was}} the key to the mystery! The Captain was {{throwing}} <b>the</b> crew overboard. <b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> met at breakfast as usual.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>we</b> {{were sitting}} down to breakfast, our friends of the other house sent in to me a plate of the largest, finest {{strawberries}} I have ever seen, which, considering {{that it was only}} the latter part of April, seemed to me quite an astonishing luxury.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bullen," [...] Hallett said, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> [...] "here <b>we</b> are again. I {{wonder how}} long we shall get to rest our wearied bodies." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{complained to}} our landlady of her {{carelessness}} in leaving wild beasts about the place, and we {{gave her a}} brief if not exactly truthful, history of the business.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{followed}} {{without difficulty}} the path indicated. A few hours' walk {{over the mountain}} pass brought us to a little straggling village of adobe houses, sleeping drowsily in the sun.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{were off}} early for Villeneuve, {{in order to}} reach the boat. This was handsomely effected, and heaving-to abreast of Vévey, we succeeded in eating our breakfast at [...] "Mon Repos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. We may {{not come}} early, for we have to {{purchase}} two pack horses to carry them, and three tats for ourselves and our man. This may take us some time, and it will be, perhaps, better {{for us to come}} to you early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>we</b> can then start away direct." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we arrived}} at <b>the</b> citadel <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> found that a change had been made. The chapel had been found too small. The court had now removed to a noble chamber {{situated}} {{at the end of}} the great hall of the castle. The number of judges was increased to sixty-two--one ignorant girl against such odds, and none to help her.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} after seven o'clock <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>we</b> turned into the {{courtyard}} of the County Hotel in Newcastle. Immediately in front of us was the car in which we had seen Delora on the previous afternoon. The chauffeur was at work upon it, and although he looked up at our entrance, he paid no particular attention to us.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were {{surprised}} to feel how warm it was on deck. We didn't need our overcoats. The sea was ever so much smoother, too. There were two or three ladies on deck, who could walk pretty well.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as we}} were up <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> rushed off to Uncle Roger's. But we met Peter and the Story Girl in the lane, {{and their}} faces were as the faces of those who bring glad tidings upon the mountains.|$|E
60|$|On coming downstairs <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{found the}} breakfast table spread very nicely, {{but there was no}} breakfast. We waited. Ten minutes went by--a quarter of an hour--twenty minutes. Then Ethelbertha rang the bell. In {{response}} Amenda presented herself, calm and respectful.|$|E
60|$|We had deceived the boatman at Pangbourne. We {{had not had}} {{the face}} {{to tell him that}} we were running away from the rain. We had left the boat, and all it contained, in his charge, with {{instructions}} that it was to be ready for us at nine <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> If, <b>we</b> said—if anything unforeseen should happen, preventing our return, we would write to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The preacher had a {{small house}} {{on the side of}} the street that he'd fixed up to rent; and he allowed me and Mrs. Hicks to occupy it till the ten-forty train <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>we</b> was going on a bridal tour to El Paso. His wife had {{decorated}} it all up with hollyhocks and poison ivy, and it looked real festal and bowery.|$|R
60|$|We encamped again <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{night as}} before, and still our good caterer {{had plenty of}} food for us; but I {{observed}} that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>we</b> set forward, our tents were left standing, the baggage mules tied together to graze, and our company lessened by all my patron's servants, which, when I inquired about, {{he told me he}} hoped we should have good quarters quickly without them.|$|R
60|$|Partner and I {{remained}} in camp all {{the afternoon and}} all the next day, although our travelling companions packed up and moved out <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>We</b> felt the need of a day's freedom from worry, and our horses needed feed and sunshine.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> had {{news of the}} {{surrender}} of Mantua to the Imperial army. We heard of it first from the Duke of Savoy's cannon, which he fired by way of rejoicing, and which seemed to make him amends {{for the loss of}} Saluzzo.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{had passed}} by the rocks and towers, the old {{familiar}} landscapes, the gleaming towns by the riverside, and the green vineyards combed along the hills, and when I woke up, {{it was at a}} great hotel at Cologne, and it was not sunrise yet.|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} natives did not disturb or concern {{themselves}} much about us; {{nor did they}} inquire, or perhaps know, whether we stayed among them or not, much less that our ship was gone quite away, and had cast us off, as was our case; for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> after <b>we</b> had sent back the long-boat, the ship stood away to the south-east, and in four hours' time was out of our sight.|$|R
5000|$|... "Troy Seals wrote that...He {{saved the}} day for us...Songwriters were bringin' things in and we were {{listening}} to songs and tapes, and Troy came in and told Billy Jones' producer and {{me that he had}} this idea, and he sung {{a little bit of the}} chorus...He came back about ten o'clock or eleven <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> before <b>we</b> went in to do our session at two o'clock, he had it all finished and it just knocked us out." ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{up early}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>we</b> {{wanted to be}} in Oxford by the afternoon. It is {{surprising}} how early one can get up, when camping out. One does not yearn for “just another five minutes” nearly so much, lying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag for a pillow, as one does in a featherbed. We had finished breakfast, and were through Clifton Lock by half-past eight.|$|R
