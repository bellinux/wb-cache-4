5000|$|Closing {{entries are}} journal entries {{made at the}} end of an {{accounting}} period to transfer <b>temporary</b> <b>accounts</b> to permanent accounts.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the year, expense {{accounts}} need to be closed, or zeroed out. Expense accounts need to be closed because they are temporary, meaning that they pertain only to a given accounting period and won’t carry over into the next one. When {{expense accounts}} are closed, they close to another <b>temporary</b> <b>account,</b> known as Income Summary. So, the expense accounts must be credited, and the Income Summary will be debited. The net loss or gain in this account transfers to Retained Earnings, which is a permanent account.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Sharing of {{services}} among wired and wireless networks provides users with more variety {{of services}}. In this paper, we concentrate {{on how to}} achieve secure service sharing for mobile users in an aggregation of heterogeneous networks. Our approach is to extended the Service Network Graph (SNG) concept to handle mobile users rambling within a guest network {{which is part of}} an SNG. Adhering to this approach, if the guest network has delegated authentication authority to the home network, the extended Service Network Graph can also set up a transient account by sharing a secret between the user and the authentication servers on the guest network and the home network. This may serve as a <b>temporary</b> <b>account</b> and facilitates mobile users to obtain services on the fly. Lastly, we discuss how to use the extended SNG for mobile IP authentication...|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} contains correspondence, legal documents, and miscellaneous items {{having to do}} with the personal lives and business interests of Barnard, Michael, and Rebecca Gratz. Included in the collection is personal correspondence of Barnard and Michael Gratz with their brothers Hayim and Jonathan in Europe (1756, 1759) and their cousins, the Henry (originally Bloch) family (1756 - 1801) in Europe, as well as correspondence of the Henry family itself (1754 - 1760). Also included in this personal correspondence are letters between Barnard and Michael Gratz (1760 - 1787) and to Solomon and Rachel Etting (1794 - 1798). There are letters also from Patrick Rice (1787), Eleazar Levy (1778), and from Moses Michael Hays who announces to Michael Gratz the forthcoming trip of his son Judah (1786) and responds to Gratz's financial distress by promising to look for a buyer for some of Gratz's land (1787). Of special interest are two printed letters from Palestine (now Israel) to Michael Gratz requesting financial assistance (1763), the last will and testament of Michael Gratz, written before he left London for America (1759), and a letter from Manuel Myers, president of Congregation Shearith Israel in New York, to Michael Gratz, giving his permission for Gershom Mendes Seixas to marry Gratz and Miriam Simon in Lancaster (1759). Included in the business papers and correspondence are letters from Meyer Josephson, in Yiddish (1761 - 1767), Nachman Ben Moshe (1764), and Joseph Simon (1771, 1784); letters from General Augustine Prevost (1773, 1789), Peter Livingston (1768), and Isaac Hart of Newport (1769); and various deeds, leases, and other legal documentsl; as well as the account of Michael Gratz with his sons, Simon and Hyman (1797 - 1814). Among the witnesses for the deeds is Aaron Levy. Of special interest is a waste book (<b>temporary</b> <b>account</b> book) of accounts, in English and Yiddish, apparently kept by Michael Gratz soon after his arrival in Philadelphia (1759 - 1760); a certificate of Kashrut in Hebrew signed by Abraham I. Abrahams of Congregation Shearith Israel for meat shipped by Michael Gratz to Barbados (1767), and papers dealing with the Gratz brothers' relationship with George Croghan. Among the latter are items pertaining to the Illinois and Wabash grants (ca. 1779), and maps of Croghan's Lake Otsego lands (1774), and of Gratzburgh (1786), both located in New York State. Also included is a map of land owned by Michael and Barnard Gratz in Montgomery County, Virginia (1786). Related is a document signed by Patrick Henry, Governor of Virginia, granting land in Montgomery County to Michael Gratz. Nine letters included in this collection were transcribed, translated, and published in "Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society," vol. 34 (1937). The collection also contains personal letters written by Rebecca Gratz of Philadelphia to various family members and friends. Her primary correspondents were her brother, Benjamin Gratz, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his wives, Maria Gist Gratz and Anna Maria Boswell Gratz. A substantial collection of letters of her friend, Maria Fenno Hoffman, wife of Ogden Hoffman, attorney general of New York State, is also included. The collection also contains several letters to Rebecca Gratz, including one from her mother (1799); several from Slowey Hays (1806 - 1832); several items pertaining to the Jewish Sunday School of Philadelphia, the Female Benevolent Society of Philadelphia, and the Orphan Society; a receipt for payment of United States income tax, along with a list of silver on which tax was paid (1862); and papers relating to Rebecca Gratz's estate.

40|$|Trauma Networks are {{currently}} founded in Germany to improve patient care of severely injured persons. To assure appropriate patient treatment {{in a short}} time, the transfer of radiological image data between the connected hospitals over the internet is an important method. This paper characterizes radiological image transfer patterns in a regional trauma network and analyzes various compression options. Within the “TraumaNetwork NorthWest” in Germany, the webbased platform “MedSix” was developed. MedSix is able to transfer DICOM-data quickly and easily between connected hospitals and can be directly connected to the local PACS. Audit data of the routine system between the 01. 01. 2012 and the 31. 12. 2012 were analyzed to identify typical characteristics of radiological image exchanges. Five different compression methods were compared by a simulation. MedSix {{has been used by}} 12 hospitals. 87 % of the transfers were uploaded within 15 min. Lossless compression is able to save about 50 % bandwidth. 82 % of the transfers have a data volume of less than 200 MB. <b>Temporary</b> <b>accounts</b> for nonregular users were used regularly. Most transfers were done from small to maximum care hospitals. It is feasible to substitute physical image exchange in a trauma network with electronic exchange of radiological images between the connected hospitals. Even large datasets are transferred within an acceptable time frame. Most transfers occur from small to large hospitals. The possibility of <b>temporary</b> <b>accounts</b> seems to be a key feature for the user acceptance...|$|R

5000|$|To {{increase}} {{an expense}} account, {{it must be}} debited. To decrease an expense account, it must be credited. The normal expense account balance is a debit. In order to understand why expenses are debited, it is relevant to note the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity. [...] Expenses show up under the equity portion of the equation because equity is common stock plus retained earnings and retained earnings are revenues minus expenses minus dividends. Expenses are considered <b>temporary</b> <b>accounts</b> in this equation, {{because at the end}} of the period, expense accounts are closed. Because expense accounts decrease the credit balance of owner’s equity, expenses must be debited.|$|R
50|$|RALs (Refund Anticipation Loans) {{are short}} term loans on the {{security}} of an expected tax refund, and RACs (Refund Anticipation Checks) are <b>temporary</b> <b>accounts</b> specifically to wait to receive tax refunds, which are then paid by a check or debit card from the bank less fees. The combination of Earned Income Credit, RALs, and RACs has created a major market for the storefront tax preparation industry. A 2002 Brookings Institution study of Cleveland taxpayers found that 47 percent of filers claiming EIC purchased RALs, as compared to 10 percent of those not claiming EIC. The tax preparation industry responded that at least one-half of RAL customers included in the IRS data actually received RACs instead.|$|R
