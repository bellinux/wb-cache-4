5|$|The American {{black bear}} (Ursus americanus), {{among the largest}} animals along <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> rarely confronts people. The black bear is the largest {{omnivore}} that may be encountered on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians. Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.|$|E
5|$|The road {{begins to}} climb again {{over the next}} few miles, passing a county park and finally the small Mount Peter ski area before {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> along the ridgecrest of Bellvale Mountain.

5|$|The {{speed limit}} is , due to curves, {{wildlife}} and tourists. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also deer, black bears, turkey, and other wildlife, which may appear and cross the road without warning. These all require extra precautions.

Numerous trails can be accessed along the drive, including a portion of <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> which follows the road's path.|$|E

5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Department of Recreational Sports, the BGSU Outdoor Program offers outdoor trips, {{an indoor}} {{climbing}} wall, team-building, and an outdoor equipment rental center to BGSU students, faculty, staff and surrounding community members. In August 2008 the program introduced the Freshman Wilderness Experience, which couples a week-long backpacking trip on <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> with a monthly class to assist students in transitioning {{from high school to}} college life. In 2009 The Outdoor Program won the David J Web Award by the Association of Outdoor Recreation and Education (AORE) as an outstanding non-profit outdoor program.|$|E
5|$|The idea of <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> {{came about}} in 1921. The trail itself was {{completed}} in 1937 {{after more than a}} decade of work, although improvements and changes continue. It is maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships, and managed by the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy. The majority of the trail is in forest or wild lands, although some portions traverse towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.|$|E

50|$|The camps {{were opened}} in 1874, {{bordering}} the West Branch of the Pleasant River in northern Maine in the United States. They included a main lodge and 13 cabins {{as well as}} satellite camps for housing loggers. The camps are a 2.2 mile hike from Gulf Hagas and a 5.2 mile hike from <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail's</b> famed 100-Mile Wilderness. They are located approximately 20 mi east of Greenville and 30 mi northwest of Brownville.|$|R
5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the drive. Skyline Drive is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley {{to the west and}} the Piedmont to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail,</b> and it is also used for biking and horseback riding. Skyline Drive is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows. The scenic drive is particularly popular in the fall for leaf peeping when the leaves are changing colors. Skyline Drive is designated a National Scenic Byway and a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White Mountain region, the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area {{was added to the}} national forest in 1914. With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. <b>The</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is part of}} a popular hiking area, with <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> <b>Trail</b> crossing the summit and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's eight mountain huts, the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, located on one of the mountain's shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman Ravine, famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 45-degree slopes. The ravine is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on the mountain in all seasons, due to harsh and rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for the wide variety of conditions which can occur above tree line.|$|E
