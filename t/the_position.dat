5|$|From its inception, <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of Minister of Defence in the {{government}} in exile was heavily contested. The appointment of Henri Rolin, an academic, to <b>the</b> <b>position</b> was particularly resented. In October 1942, Pierlot dismissed Rolin who he accused of involving himself in factional internal politics of the army, parts of which had begun to behave mutinously about their perceived inaction. To resolve the deadlock, Pierlot decided to take on <b>the</b> <b>position</b> personally. He began a major restructuring of the command structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt to resolve the situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 8 that among the four {{different}} shape models, <b>the</b> 10 <b>positioning</b> times of <b>the</b> square and circular models are generally relatively small. In this paper, the time average of <b>the</b> <b>positioning</b> calculation of each model is calculated according to the data of Fig.  8. The result shows that <b>the</b> average <b>positioning</b> time of <b>the</b> square is 8850  ms, <b>the</b> average <b>positioning</b> time of <b>the</b> circle is 8860  ms, <b>the</b> average <b>positioning</b> time of <b>the</b> triangle is 9700  ms, and <b>the</b> <b>positioning</b> time of <b>the</b> regular hexagon is 9630  ms. <b>The</b> <b>positioning</b> time of positioning square and circular is smaller.

30|$|Figure  7 shows <b>the</b> {{robot arm}} <b>positioning</b> error at {{different}} model placement angles. According to <b>the</b> visual robot’s <b>positioning</b> error for different angles of different models, this paper calculates <b>the</b> <b>positioning</b> error of visual robots for different models. <b>The</b> average <b>positioning</b> error of <b>the</b> regular quadrilateral is 0.86  mm, <b>the</b> average <b>positioning</b> error of <b>the</b> circular shape is 0.8  mm, and <b>the</b> average <b>positioning</b> errors for <b>the</b> triangle and the hexagon are 0.93  mm and 1.27  mm, respectively. The data {{results show that}} the robot system will produce different positioning errors for different shape models. The mean value of <b>the</b> <b>positioning</b> error of <b>the</b> visual robot for the regular quadrilateral and the circle is significantly smaller than the mean value of <b>the</b> <b>positioning</b> error for <b>the</b> triangle and the hexagon. Therefore, the use of a regular quadrilateral and circular model with low positioning error rate can improve <b>the</b> accuracy of <b>positioning.</b>|$|R

The use of a wing-forward provoked controversy both in New Zealand, and later in the British Isles after the All Blacks toured there in 1905; wing-forwards were often accused of off-side obstruction of the opposition half-back.
