The hydrogels, obtained using different amounts of STMP, were characterised by Infrared Spectroscopy which confirmed the successful occurrence of crosslinking reaction.

The rheological analysis pointed out that {{only one of the}} hydrogels (PVA STMP 8 : 1) showed a behaviour similar to that of human vitreous. The hydrogel was also subjected to injection through a small needle, a procedure that is essential in the use of vitreous substitutes.

The resultant amorphous SDM-Ms were excellently identified by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The internal rupture and surface-controlled erosion were the predominant degradation mechanisms for SDM-Ms. The obtained SDM-Ms were applied to adsorb coix seed oil (CSO) by immersing method. The adsorption capacity of CSO within SDM-Ms was determined, namely 0. 5238 g/g, and the thermal stability was shown {{higher than that of}} the free CSO. A burst release appeared in the second hour, followed by controlled release. Diffusion, degradation, and erosion mechanisms might coexist for the full release processes. The soluble starch (Ss) was demonstrated a promising biodegradable polymer for preparing the porous microspheres. Meanwhile, after being adsorbed into the SDM-Ms, the CSO can be powerfully applied in food and pharmaceutical industries.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{synthesize}} injectable hydrogels suitable as vitreous body substitutes, a new method {{based on the}} use of <b>trisodium</b> <b>trimetaphosphate</b> (STMP) to cross-link PVA was recently proposed. Hydrogels with differentmolar ratios between STMP and PVA were realised. The aim {{of the present study was}} the evaluation of the biocompatibility of the different STMP/PVA hydrogels synthesised by analysing the effects of their in vitro interaction with cultures of mouse fibroblasts NIH 3 T 3, primary human microvascular endothelial cells adult (HMVECad) and human lens cells. Cytotoxicity of hydrogels was first evaluated by analysing cell density and proliferation. Morphological and morphometric analysis of cell in contact with hydrogels was then performed using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Moreover, cell adhesion and growth onto the hydrogels surface was evaluated and correlated to the amount of adsorbed proteins. At last, the biocompatibility of the sheared STMP/PVA 1 : 8 hydrogel was tested. The in vitro data of all the STMP/PVA hydrogels demonstrated their good biocompatibility, and indicated that the 1 : 8 sample was the most promising as vitreous body substitute...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Silk fibroin (SF) {{and rice}} starch (RS) are both biopolymers being non-toxic, {{biocompatible}} and biodegradable {{which can be}} utilized as hydrogels. The {{aim of this study}} was to prepare the SF–RS hydrogels modified with <b>trisodium</b> <b>trimetaphosphate</b> (STMP) and determine its crosslinking density for providing a guideline for preparing better quality absorbable hydrogels. The SF–RS hydrogels modified with various percentages of STMP were prepared by solution casting at pH 12 then neutralized to pH 7. The functional groups and molecular linkages of the hydrogels were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectrometry, respectively. Finally, the crosslinking density of the hydrogels was determined by UV/Vis spectrophotometry via the measurement of the relative amount of methylene blue (RMB) bound to the hydrogels. Results from the FTIR and 1 H NMR spectra revealed that linkages within the hydrogels occurred mainly between the O–H groups of RS and the triphosphate groups of STMP. From the MB adsorption study, the crosslinking density of the SF–RS hydrogel with 1. 0 %w/w STMP at the 60 min saturation time was approximately 63 %...|$|E
40|$|Owing to the {{markedly}} increased {{reactivity of}} amino functional groups versus hydroxyls, the 5 ′-amino- 5 ′-deoxy nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have proven widely useful in biological, pharmaceutical and genomic applications. However, synthetic procedures leading to these analogs {{have not been}} fully explored, which may possibly have limited the scope of their utility. Here we describe the synthesis of the 5 ′-amino- 2 ′, 5 ′-dideoxy analogs of adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, inosine and uridine from their respective naturally occurring nucleosides via the reduction of 5 ′-azido- 2 ′, 5 ′-dideoxy intermediates using the Staudinger reaction, and the high yield conversion of these modified nucleosides and 5 ′-amino- 5 ′-deoxythymidine to the corresponding 5 ′-N-triphosphates through reaction with <b>trisodium</b> <b>trimetaphosphate</b> {{in the presence of}} tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris). We also show that each of these nucleotide analogs can be efficiently incorporated into DNA by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I when individually substituted for its naturally occurring counterpart. Mild acid treatment of the resulting DNA generates polynucleotide fragments that arise from specific cleavage at each modified nucleotide, providing a sequence ladder for each base. Because the ladders are generated after the extension, the corresponding products may be manipulated by enzymatic and/or purification processes. The potential utility of this extension–cleavage procedure in genomic sequence analysis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{immersion}} solutions containing enterocin AS- 48 {{alone or in}} combination with chemical preservatives on survival and proliferation of Listeria monocytogenes CECT 4032 inoculated on fresh alfalfa sprouts, soybean sprouts, and green asparagus was tested. Immersion treatments (5 min at room temperature) with AS- 48 solutions (25 �g/ml) reduced listeria counts of artificially contaminated alfalfa and soybean sprouts by approximately 2. 0 to 2. 4 log CFU/g compared to a control immersion treatment in distilled water. The same bacteriocin immersion treatment applied on green asparagus had a very limited effect. During storage of vegetable samples treated with immersion solutions of 12. 5 and 25 �g of AS- 48 /ml, viable listeria counts were reduced below detection limits at days 1 to 7 for alfalfa and soybean sprouts at 6 and 15 °C, as well as green asparagus at 15 °C. Only a limited inhibition of listeria proliferation was detected during storage of bacteriocintreated alfalfa sprouts and green asparagus at 22 °C. Treatment with solutions containing AS- 48 plus lactic acid, sodium lactate, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, trisodium phosphate, <b>trisodium</b> <b>trimetaphosphate,</b> sodium thiosulphate, n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydoxybenzoic acid methyl ester, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, peracetic acid, or sodium hypochlorite reduced viable counts of listeria below detection limits (by approximately 2. 6 to 2. 7 log CFU/g) upon application of the immersion treatment and/or further storage for 24 h, depending of the chemical preservative concentration.

40|$|Using {{a channel}} flow cell (CFC) system, the {{dissolution}} kinetics of polycrystalline gypsum-based materials {{have been examined}} {{with the aim of}} understanding their interaction with water, a property that limits the applications of the material in many situations. ICP (inductively coupled plasma) analysis of elemental concentrations in solution as a function of time yields surface fluxes by using a finite element modeling approach to simulate the hydrodynamic behavior within the CFC. After correction for surface roughness, a value for the intrinsic dissolution flux into water of pure polycrystalline gypsum, CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, of 1. 1 (± 0. 4) × 10 – 8 mol cm– 2 s– 1 has been obtained. The addition of known humid creep inhibitors to the gypsum samples, including boric acid, tartaric acid and 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid), was found to have little measurable effect on the dissolution kinetics of gypsum: all yielded dissolution fluxes of 1. 4 (± 0. 6) × 10 – 8 mol cm– 2 s– 1. However, <b>trisodium</b> <b>trimetaphosphate</b> (STMP) was found to have a small detectable inhibitory effect relative to pure gypsum yielding a flux of 7. 4 (± 2. 0) × 10 – 9 mol cm– 2 s– 1. The data strongly suggest that models for humid creep inhibition that involve dissolution–crystallization of gypsum crystallites are less likely than those that involve a hindered ingress of water into the gypsum matrix. For comparison, composite materials that comprised of calcium sulfate anhydrite (CaSO 4) crystallites bound by a polyphosphate matrix were also studied. For some of these samples, Ca 2 + surface fluxes were observed to be 1 order of magnitude lower than values for polycrystalline gypsum control substrates, suggesting a useful way to impart water resistance to gypsum-based materials...|$|E
