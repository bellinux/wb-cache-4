She <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> she could be that person. He also began to pressure her to join the Nation of Islam. In mid 1956, Sanders converted. Like many members of the Nation of Islam, she changed her surname to [...] "X", which represented the family name of her African ancestors that she could never know.|$|E

Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult than I expected because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> I was overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ".

500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we think we can make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> there would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I <b>thought,</b> <b>maybe</b> there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there.

It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course.

Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman Gordon Taylor said that Suárez would be offered anger management counselling. Gus Poyet thought the reaction had been exaggerated, theorising that Suárez could leave English football if he carried on being punished and maligned for his actions, treatment he thought was hypocritical when compared to others.|$|E
