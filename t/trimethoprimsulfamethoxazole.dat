40|$|Background: Growing {{antibiotic}} resistance warrants studying nonantibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Use of lactobacilli {{appears to be}} promising. Methods: Between January 2005 and August 2007, we randomized 252 postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs {{taking part in a}} double-blind noninferiority trial to receive 12 months of prophylaxis with <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole,</b> 480 mg, once daily or oral capsules containing 09 colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR- 1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC- 14 twice daily. Primary end points were the mean number of symptomatic UTIs, proportion of participants with at least 1 UTI during 12 months, time to first UTI, and development of {{antibiotic resistance}} by Escherichia coli. Results: The mean number of symptomatic UTIs in the year preceding randomization was 7. 0 in the <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> group and 6. 8 in the lactobacilli group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after 12 months of prophylaxis, these numbers were 2. 9 and 3. 3, respectively. The between-treatment difference of 0. 4 UTIs per year (95 % CI, - 0. 4 to 1. 5) was outside our noninferiority margin. At least 1 symptomatic UTI occurred in 69. 3 % and 79. 1 % of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and lactobacilli participants, respectively; median times to the first UTI were 6 and 3 months, respectively. After 1 month of <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> prophylaxis, resistance to <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole,</b> trimethoprim, and amoxicillin had increased from approximately 20 % to 40 % to approximately 80 % to 95 % in E coli from the feces and urine of asymptomatic women and among E coli causing a UTI. During the 3 months after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole discontinuation, resistance levels gradually decreased. Resistance did not increase during lactobacilli prophylaxis. Conclusions: In postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs, L rhamnosus GR- 1 and L reuteri RC- 14 do not meet the noninferiority criteria in the prevention of UTIs when compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, unlike trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, lactobacilli do not increase antibiotic resistance. Trial Registration: isrctn. org Identifier: ISRCTN 50717094...|$|E

The in vitro activity of FR- 31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6 -phosphate or fructose 6 -phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR- 31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8 - to 16 -fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR- 31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter.

Data were analyzed using chi-square, Fisher’s exact test and ninety-five percent confidence intervals, as appropriate. Results: Ninety-five positive cultures were identified. Isolates were more often susceptible to <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> (TMP-SMX) (87 %) and nitrofurantoin (89 %) than to ampicillin (72 %) (p < 0. 03). Escherichia coli accounted for 71 (75 %) cases and was more often susceptible to nitrofurantoin (100 %) than to TMP-SMX (87 %) (p < 0. 01).

Methods: Retrospective medical chart review Results: A 16 -year-old Caucasian female presented with vision loss in her right eye. In addition to a white active lesion between the fovea and the optic nerve head, marked vitreous opacification was noted. She was diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis. The patient was treated with oral azithromycin, clindamycin, and <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.</b> One month later, retinochoroiditis resolved and vitreous cleared. Three months after onset, patient presented with floaters in the right eye and a retinal tear was located at the temporal region of the retina. Prophylactic argon laser treatment that encircled the retinal tear was performed. No other abnormalities were noted during 6 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Retinal tear associated with ocular toxoplasmosis is rare; however, a retinal tear can occur due to vitreoretinal traction following post-inflammatory structural alteration of the vitreous. Retinal tears may be seen during the healing phase, when the inflammation turns into tightening of vitreous substance. Careful retinal examination in cases of ocular toxoplasmosis is warranted, especially in patients with severe vitreous inflammation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Fluoroquinolones are an {{important}} class of antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} urinary tract infections that have axcellent activity against Escherichia coli, one of the most frequently encountered pathogens. Several European studies have reported an increase of resistance to quinolones among uropathogenic E. coli. We conducted this study to update our knowledge on this evolution. Materials and methods: We evaluated the resistance phenotype of 203 clinical strains of E. coli collected from urine specimens. The following antimicrobial agents were tested: ampicillin, amoxiciclin-clavulanate, piperacillintazobactam, cefamandole, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole,</b> gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, pipemidic acid, norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin. Disk diffusion tests were carried out as suggested by the CLSI (2006); strains were assigned to the susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate and resistant) interpreting results according to the established breakpoints. Results: Resistance to quinolones (pipemidic acid, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was about of 45 % and resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 57. 1 % and 55. 2 %, respectively. Resistance rates less than 5 % was found for cefepime, amikacin and imipenem. Conclusions: This study confirms the evolution through resistance to quinolones of uropathogenic E. coli isolates.

Results: A total of 312 C. jejuni isolates were obtained from travelers (n = 46) and U. S. military personnel (n = 266) in Thailand who were experiencing acute diarrhea. Nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance was observed in 94. 9 % and 93. 0 % of the isolates, respectively.

Thirty-eight percent of the strains were resistant to tetracycline. Salmonella serovars differed markedly in their drug resistance profiles. Biochemical characterization of the Salmonella showed that the S. anatum, S. saintpaul and S. reading serovars could be divided into distinct biotypes...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluated, for {{the first}} time, the {{selection}} of antibiotic resistance in faecal Escherichia coli, a potential reservoir of genes of resistance, during the prolonged exposure to fluoroquinolones after the implantation of a local drug delivery system (LDDS) in a swine model. Fourteen pigs {{were randomly assigned to}} group IM (5 mg/kg/day of intramuscular enrofloxacin - EFX) or LD (surgical implantation of EFX-polymethyl-methacrylate peri-femoral implants). Blood samples were collected daily for determination of plasma EFX and ciprofloxacin (CFX) concentrations. faecal samples were collected daily to determine the E. coli counts and the susceptibility patterns of its isolates as evaluated by antibiotic disk diffusion tests. In both groups, EFX administration significantly reduced the bacterial counts after 2 days. During recolonization, the bacterial counts remained lower than baseline in group IM but not significantly, and almost reached pre-treatment levels in group LD. Susceptibility to EFX, CFX, and nalidixic acid of recolonizing E. coli in LD pigs slightly decreased but remained within the limit of "susceptible" isolates. In contrast, quinolone susceptibility of recolonizing E. coli in IM pigs dropped dramatically (P< 0. 0001). In addition, intramuscular exposure to fluoroquinolones significantly decreased the susceptibility of E. coli to ampicillin and <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, the use of a dosing regimen that minimized the intestinal output of fluoroquinolones also minimized the selection of resistance to several classes of antibiotics. This could represent another advantage of LDDS usage compared to long-lasting systemic administration of fluoroquinolones. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Burn wound {{infections are}} the most severe cause of {{mortality}} in patients in the burn units. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the bacteriological profile and their antibiotic resistance patterns in burn unit of Dicle University Hospital. Methods: Medical records of 151 burn patients admitted to the burn unit of Dicle University Hospital between June, 2008 and June 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Our study included 70. 2 % (n= 106) male and 29. 8 % (n= 45) female patients. The mean age of cases was 10. 9 ± 14. 7 years. The rate of isolated microorganisms were 62. 3 % (n= 94) Acinetobacter baumannii, 25. 8 % (n= 39) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7. 3 % (n= 11) Escherichia coli and 4. 6 % (n= 7) Staphylococcus aureus. The most effective antibiotic against A. baumannii was colistin (95 %) followed by levofloxacin (84 %) and <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> (87 %). The most effective antibiotics against P. aeruginosa were amikacin (82 %), ciprofloxacin (71 %) and levofloxacin (71 %). The most effective antibiotics against E. coli were amikacin (91 %), meropenem (73 %) and imipenem (82 %). Conclusion: The prevalence of burn wound infection caused by A. baumannii and multiple drug resistant A. baumannii are increasing worldwide by time. The prevalence of multiple drug resistant P. aeruginosa and E. coliare rising also. So, new strategies of infection prevention should improve as soon as possible.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of R- 3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH 2 OCH 3 moiety at position 3, was {{compared with those}} of other antibiotics. R- 3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0. 06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2 - to 8 -fold more active than cefixime, and 16 - to 64 -fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0. 25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R- 3746 for 90 % of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were {{less than or equal to}} 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.</b> R- 3746 inhibited 50 % of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0. 5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundOptimal {{empirical}} therapy of {{urinary tract}} infection requires accurate knowledge of local susceptibility patterns, which may vary with organism and patient characteristics. MethodsAmong 9, 798 consecutive, non-duplicate, community-source urine isolates from ambulatory patients ≥ 13 years old, from clinical laboratory and an academic medical center in Curitiba, Brazil (May 1 st to December 1 st, 2009), susceptibility data for ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, fluoroquinolones, and ceftriaxone/cefotaxime were compared with organism and patient gender and age. ResultsThe female-to-male ratio decreased with age, from 28. 1 (among 20 – 29 year-olds) to 3. 3 (among > 80 year-olds). Overall, susceptibility prevalence varied widely by drug class, from unacceptably low levels (53. 5 % and 61. 1 %: ampicillin and <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole)</b> to acceptable but suboptimal levels (81. 2 % to 91. 7 %: fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, nitrofurantoin, and gentamicin). E. coli isolates exhibited higher susceptibility rates than other isolates, from 3 – 4 % higher (fluoroquinolones, gentamicin) to ≥ 30 % (nitrofurantoin, ceftriaxone). Males exhibited lower susceptibility rates than females. Within each gender, susceptibility declined with increasing age. For females, only nitrofurantoin and gentamicin were suitable for empirical therapy (≥ 80 % susceptibility) across all age cohorts; fluoroquinolones were suitable only through age 60, and ceftriaxone only through age 80. For males, only gentamicin yielded ≥ 80 % susceptibility in any age cohort. ConclusionFew suitable empirical treatment options for community-source {{urinary tract infection}} were identified for women aged over 60 years or males of any age. Empirical therapy recommendations must consider the patient's demographic characteristics.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Encephalopathy {{associated}} with metronidazole is rare and, in most cases, reversible following discontinuation. OBJECTIVE: We describe {{a case of}} fatal encephalopathy after treatment with high-dose intravenous metronidazole and the potential causes of the irreversibility. CASE SUMMARY: A 38 -year-old white woman (weight, 45 kg) received metronidazole among other medications to treat osteomyelitis for 74 days after surgery to correct a spinal neuroarthropathy. An initial dose of 500 mg IV QID was administered. After 6 weeks, the patient was discharged and the dose was changed to 1500 mg IV administered once daily (over 90 minutes) by a visiting nurse. Other treatments included teicoplanin 400 mg once daily and <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole</b> 480 mg BID for the infection, baclofen 25 mg TID for pain {{associated with}} a congenital spinal cord lesion with paraplegia, and omeprazole 20 mg once daily for pyrosis. Ten weeks {{after the start of}} metronidazole, the patient developed somnolence and dysarthria, changing to encephalopathy with coma on admission 2 weeks later. Despite discontinuation of all medication, including metronidazole, 2 days after admission, the patient's condition appeared to be irreversible. After 8 weeks, her coma was considered permanent, mechanical ventilation was discontinued, and she died. Evaluating all medicines administered, metronidazole, with a Naranjo adverse drug reaction score of 5 (probable), was the most plausible cause of the encephalopathy. The other medicines, including baclofen, had a negative score of - 3 to - 2 (doubtful). All tests on infections, metabolic disorders, or interactions between medications were negative. CONCLUSION: This patient had a fatal encephalopathy, probably associated with long-standing exposure to high plasma concentration peaks of metronidazole, due to a once-daily dose of 1500 mg IV over several weeks...|$|E

40|$|Resistance to {{penicillin}} {{and multiple}} antimicrobial agents among Streptococcus pneumoniae strains {{is becoming an}} increasing problem worldwide and in Asia. To determine the prevalence of carriage of S. pneumoniae isolates not susceptible to penicillin in young children, we obtained nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 1, 978 children (ages, 2 to 6 years) attending 79 day care centers or kindergartens. Three hundred eighty-three strains of S. pneumoniae were isolated from these children. Fifty-eight percent of these isolates had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 123 (32. 1 %) were intermediate, and 100 (26. 1 %) were resistant. A very high penicillin MIC (4 μg/ml) was found in 3. 3 % of the isolates. The isolates also demonstrated high rates of resistance to other antimicrobial agents (51. 2 % to cefaclor, 50. 2 % to cefuroxime, 42. 8 % to cefotaxime, 80. 7 % to <b>trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole,</b> 77 % to erythromycin, 60 % to clindamycin, and 33. 7 % to chloramphenicol). No isolate was resistant to fluoroquinolone. Multidrug resistance (not susceptible to the β-lactams {{and three or more}} other classes) was found in 39. 4 % of the isolates. Risk factors for the carriage of S. pneumoniae not susceptible to penicillin were multiple physician visits in the preceding 3 months and use of antimicrobial agents by the individual or by household members in the preceding 3 months. In the logistic regression analysis, only the use of antimicrobial agents in the preceding 3 months was an independent risk factor (P = 0. 004; odds ratio, 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 to 3. 2). This study demonstrated the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae in healthy young children in the community in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
