25|$|In 2016, Kudlow {{endorsed}} Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump. He later defended Mr. Trump's {{plans to}} build a wall along the border with Mexico and to prevent Muslims from entering the United States, declaring that the United States was at war with ISIS and Trump was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> necessary to protect the country. He also penned an article for Real Clear Politics advocating for conservative unity in the election and asking his conservative peers to stop criticizing Trump and instead help him become a stronger candidate.|$|E
25|$|Though Messier was {{actually}} {{under contract to}} the Oilers until 1993, his agent and father Doug Messier unsuccessfully pressed Sather for a new deal {{in the summer of}} 1990. After the 1990–91 season, Messier was upset that the Oilers were willing to let Adam Graves leave the team. Messier issued a public trade demand during the Canada Cup tournament saying that he wanted out if the Oilers were not willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> necessary to keep important players. On October 4, 1991, in one of many cost-cutting moves by Edmonton management, Messier was traded to the New York Rangers for Louie DeBrusk, Bernie Nicholls, and Steven Rice.|$|E
25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than her own family unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional {{to stand up to the}} beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.|$|E

25|$|Despite those controversies and the {{apparent}} {{lessons learned from}} the Vietnam War, some theorists recognized a significant problem with Huntington's theory insofar as it appears to question the notion of a separate, apolitical professional military. While there is little argument that separate civilian and military worlds exist, there is significant debate about the proper interaction between the two. As discussed above, Huntington proposed that the ideal arrangement was one whereby civilian political leaders provided objective control to the military leadership and then stepped back to permit the experts in violence <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> most effective. He further stated that the most dangerous arrangement was one whereby civilian leaders intruded extensively in the military world, creating a situation whereby the military leadership was not politically neutral and security of the nation was thus threatened both by an ineffective military and by provoking the military to avoid taking orders.|$|E
25|$|God gave David {{rest from}} his enemies, and David asked Nathan the prophet why David should dwell {{in a house}} of cedar, while the Ark dwelt within curtains. At first Nathan told David <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in his heart, but that same night God {{directed}} Nathan to tell David not to build God a house, for God had not dwelt in a house since the day that God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, but had abided in a tent and in a tabernacle. God directed Nathan to tell David that God took David from following sheep to be a prince over Israel, God had been with David wherever he went, and God would make David a great name. God would provide {{a place for the}} Israelites at rest from their enemies, God would make David into a dynasty, and when David died, God would see that David's son would build a house for God's name. God would be to David's son a father, and he would be to God a son; if he strayed, God would chasten him, but God's mercy would not depart from him. David's kingdom would be established forever. And Nathan told David everything in his vision.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the Canucks' 23-man roster being set {{following}} the end of preseason, they claimed defenceman Ryan Stanton off waivers. Stanton had played only one NHL game but was brought in as a possible replacement for Alberts in order to keep a balance between right and left handed defencemen. The youth movement failed to take hold. Guance was sent back to the Belleville Bulls. Despite having a good camp, he was outplayed by fellow prospects, Horvat and Shinkaruk. Tortorella felt Gaunce needed to improve the tempo and the pace of his game and he would benefit from playing more minutes. Due to the injuries and suspensions, it appeared that Horvat and Shinkaruk would start the season with the Canucks. However, just days before the roster was set, Vancouver acquired forwards Zac Dalpe and Jeremy Welsh from the Carolina Hurricanes. Following the trade Horvat was sent back to the London Knights, Shinkaruk remained with the team, but was returned to the Medicine Hat Tigers to make room for Stanton. As {{with the rest of the}} prospects, Vancouver was pleased with their play, but wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> best for their development. Helping to make the decision to return the prospects to their junior teams was the emergence of Mike Santorelli who had a strong camp, where he was one of Vancouver's best forwards. He earned Tortorella's trust and was played in all situations helping him to make the team.|$|E

500|$|Gervase Hughes concludes his {{chapter on}} Sullivan's orchestration: [...] "n this vitally {{important}} {{sector of the}} composer's art he deserves to rank as a master." [...] Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and a technically highly skilled orchestrator. Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect. Percy Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan's music: [...] "Sullivan never asked his players <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> either uncongenial or impracticable." ...|$|E

500|$|Wellard's {{name is a}} {{portmanteau}} of [...] "well hard", meaning [...] "very tough". The {{character was}} originally played by a Belgian Shepherd (Tervuren) named Zenna, who was cast {{at the age of}} one. Producers had envisioned Wellard as a [...] "rough, tough mongrel", and Zenna's owner, dog-handler Gill Raddings, explained: [...] "She had the look they wanted and the ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> needed on command." [...] EastEnders producers were initially unaware that Zenna was female, and had to find a canine double to serve as temporary replacement in 1996 when it transpired that she was pregnant, going on to deliver 10 puppies. Zenna was retired in 1998, as she was [...] "losing her looks".|$|E
500|$|August Brown of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole {{gets in the}} song".

[...] Mlynar further stated that [...] "Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely — he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there." [...] Contrarily, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: [...] " [...] didn't like try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> already done.

500|$|Arthur's unpopularity in life {{carried over}} into his {{assessment}} by historians, and his reputation after leaving office disappeared. [...] By 1935, historian George F. Howe said that Arthur had achieved [...] "an obscurity in strange contrast to his significant part in American history." [...] By 1975, however, Thomas C. Reeves would write that Arthur's [...] "appointments, if unspectacular, were unusually sound; the corruption and scandal that dominated business and politics of the period did not tarnish his administration." [...] As 2004 biographer Zachary Karabell wrote, although Arthur was [...] "physically stretched and emotionally strained, he strove <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right for the country." [...] Indeed, Howe had earlier surmised, [...] "Arthur adopted [...] for his own political behavior but subject to three restraints: he remained to everyone {{a man of his}} word; he kept scrupulously free from corrupt graft; he maintained a personal dignity, affable and genial though he might be. These restraints... distinguished him sharply from the stereotype politician." ...|$|E

500|$|Marcus also {{involved}} himself in issues {{of civil rights}} and social justice. One unusual case involved three male students at W. W. Samuell High School who, in 1966, were stopped at the school's front door and ordered to cut their hair {{in order to be}} admitted to the school. The young men filed a lawsuit against the Dallas Independent School District, claiming the restriction interfered with their constitutional freedom of expression. Despite not knowing the boys involved, Marcus stepped forward to champion their case before the public, taking out a newspaper ad defending the choice as a simple fashion decision rather than rebellion against authority. Additionally, he offered legal support if needed, noting in a telegram to school board president Lee McShan, Jr., [...] "I don’t like long hair any more than the principal does, but I will fight for the rights of those students to wear hair any way they choose." [...] Though the case was lost and appealed {{all the way to the}} U.S. Supreme Court without success, decades letter the men still appreciated Marcus' support. Paul Jarvis, one of the plaintiffs, said of Marcus after his death in 2002: [...] "He was just a nice man and a great contributor to Dallas and to the arts. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the system}} became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible. [...] As a result, {{as time went}} on, {{increasing}} numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the Lord Chancellor gave judgment <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> equitable in a case. From the time of Sir Thomas More, the first lawyer to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own Court of Chancery. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied {{according to the length}} of the Chancellor's foot. Over time, courts of equity developed solid principles, especially under Lord Eldon. In the 19th century in England, and in 1937 in the U.S., the two systems were merged.|$|E
2500|$|Henry often {{served as}} host at Hanover Tavern {{as part of}} his duties, and entertained the guests by playing the fiddle. Among those who stayed there during this time was the young Thomas Jefferson, aged 17, en route to his studies at the College of William and Mary, and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with Henry then, despite their age {{difference}} of six years. Jefferson in 1824 told Daniel Webster, [...] "Patrick Henry was originally a bar-keeper", a characterization that Henry's biographers have found to be unfair. William Wirt, Henry's earliest biographer, rejected Jefferson's suggestion that Henry's profession then was a bartender, but noted it would have been [...] "very natural in Mr. Henry's situation" [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to.|$|E
