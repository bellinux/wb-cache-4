5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E

40|$|Variations of {{frequency}} separations of low-degree p-modes are studied over the solar activity cycle. <b>The</b> <b>separations</b> studied are {{obtained from the}} frequencies of low-degree p-modes of the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). 10. 7 cm radio flux is used as an index of solar activity. Small <b>separations</b> of <b>the</b> p-mode frequencies {{are considered to be}} mainly dependent on the conditions in stellar interiors. Thus they could be applied to diagnose the changes in the stellar interior. Our calculation results show that the magnitudes of variations of <b>the</b> mean large <b>separations</b> are less than 1 σ over the solar activity cycle. Small separations show different behaviors in the ascending and descending phases of activity. In the ascending phase, variations of <b>the</b> small <b>separations</b> are less than 1 σ. However, <b>the</b> small <b>separations</b> have systematic shifts during 2004 - 2007. The shifts are roughly 1 σ or more. The variations of the ratios of the small to large separations with time are similar to the changes of <b>the</b> small <b>separations.</b> <b>The</b> effects of the changes in <b>the</b> large <b>separations</b> on <b>the</b> ratios are negligible. The variations of <b>the</b> <b>separations</b> may be a consequence of the influence from the surface activity or systematic errors in measurements or some processes taking place in the solar interior.

30|$|Source {{of water}} to <b>the</b> bed <b>{{separation}}.</b> Bed separation provides potential reservoir space for underground water. Water supply determines the volume of water and hydrostatic pressure in <b>the</b> bed <b>separation.</b> Generally, <b>the</b> underground water in the strata above <b>the</b> bed <b>separation</b> is <b>the</b> direct water source, which quickly fills up the bed-separation void under the negative pressure, thus driving up the water pressure in <b>the</b> bed <b>separation</b> up to <b>the</b> level in the upper strata (apparently, if the upper strata are insufficiently water abundant, <b>the</b> bed <b>separation</b> would not be filled up and bed-separation water pressure would not rise {{to that in the}} upper strata). In addition to direct water source, there would be indirect source of water (such as the Quaternary pore aquifer) that replenishes <b>the</b> bed <b>separation</b> through inter-stratum fissures or water-conductive structure.|$|R

30|$|The {{formation}} of bed-separation water hazards is closed related with geological and mining factors.

The water source to the bed-separation water {{will have an impact}} on the water volume and hydrostatic pressure in <b>the</b> bed <b>separation.</b> Among mining factors, when full-caving rooftop management is applied, the lifecycle of bed separation, from formation, development to maturity, is largely constrained by the cyclical rock pressure. Mining height is positively correlated to bed <b>separation</b> height. <b>The</b> strike length and slope width of the mining working face will determine the lifespan of <b>the</b> bed <b>separation.</b> Mining at a constant speed can slow down water accumulation in <b>the</b> bed <b>separation.</b>|$|R
