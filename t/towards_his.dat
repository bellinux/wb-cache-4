Trijata, a half-Aryan, is labelled a traitor, who betrays her uncle Ravana and helps Sita. Vibhishana's betrayal <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> brother and defection to Rama is also blamed on his Aryan wife.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Rocky Schenck and was released on 28 April 1997. It features Barlow performing the song in France, walking down a highway littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward. As he performs the chorus, he jumps off the set and walks <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> stage chair, where he sits and observes his surroundings. The video ends with Barlow running away from a woman down a country road, as the video fades from view.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rebel}} forces {{advanced}} <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts. Although they suffered some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{played the}} lead role in two Python films, Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He was chosen to play the lead in Holy Grail because of the group's respect <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> {{straight}} acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude {{in front of a}} crowd in Life of Brian, but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems with the female Muslim extras.|$|E

5|$|Dale walks {{alone in}} the fields to cool off when he comes across a cow that has had its stomach gutted. Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} head back when a walker attacks him. The group races <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{fascination with the}} novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), and a new edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977. The last few decades have however seen a resurgence of critical interest in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Escape from Woomera is a point-and-click {{adventure}} game. The player, controlling Mustafa, {{explores the}} Woomera centre, which is populated with non-player characters—computer-controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him {{information about the}} facility, sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> goal of escaping the facility.|$|E

5|$|He had a paternalistic {{attitude}} <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> {{subjects and}} {{believed that it was}} his duty to treat the Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, Wallhead fought Welshman Paul Jenkins. This was Wallhead's first title {{fight in}} mixed martial arts, as they competed for the House of Pain Welterweight title {{in front of}} Jenkins' home crowd of Cardiff, Wales. Wallhead won the fight via {{majority}} decision after five rounds, giving him the title. Just over two years to that day, Wallhead rematched Jenkins in a kickboxing bout (thus not counting <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> pro-MMA record); this time in Wallhead's hometown of Nottingham. Wallhead showed effective low kicks and combinations which earned him a unanimous decision victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Jason McPeck, a young cancer patient, is ushered {{out of the}} car, {{carried past}} cameras and {{shouting}} onlookers, and placed in his bed, where his father tells him that God will decide if he can be cured of his cancer. Later in the night, the boy sees bright light and men in black walking <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> window. The next day, the boy is miraculously cured of his cancer.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1832, Black Hawk {{and about}} 200 warriors {{attacked}} at the hastily constructed Apple River Fort, near present-day Elizabeth, Illinois. Local settlers, warned of Black Hawk's approach, {{took refuge in}} the fort, which was defended by about 20 to 35 militiamen. The Battle of Apple River Fort lasted about forty-five minutes. The women and girls inside the fort, {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Armstrong, loaded muskets and molded bullets. After losing several men, Black Hawk broke off the siege, looted the nearby homes, and headed back <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> camp.|$|E
5|$|Robert died on 27 February 1167. William fitzStephen, one of Becket's supporters, {{wrote that}} Robert died of grief {{because he was}} unable to visit Becket in exile. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral. Robert enjoyed a good {{reputation}} on the continent, for his knowledge and teaching ability, as well as for his personal qualities. Before his appointment to Hereford, John of Salisbury had praised him, but Robert's conduct during the Becket controversy soured John's attitude <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> old teacher.|$|E

5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting almost three times longer than Magnus'). Modern historians have noted that this probably has made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, skewed <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> deeds as a warrior).|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of Coloman's absence, Álmos began to conspire against {{the king and}} mustered his armies. Coloman returned from Croatia and marched his army <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> brother's duchy in 1098. The two armies met at Tiszavárkony, with only the river Tisza separating them. However, the commanders of the two troops started negotiations and decided not to fight each other, compelling the king and the duke to make peace.|$|E
5|$|The {{change of}} {{government}} was welcome {{particularly to the}} senators, who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill <b>towards</b> <b>his</b> supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would {{be put to death}} as long as he remained in office. He called an end to trials based on treason, released those who had been imprisoned under these charges, and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.|$|E
