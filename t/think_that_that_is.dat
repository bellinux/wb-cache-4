500|$|In a 2011 {{appearance}} {{as host of}} Saturday Night Live while promoting his film The Muppets, Jason Segel mentioned The Land of Gorch in his opening monologue. In a follow-up interview, {{he was asked about}} the possibility of re-introducing The Land of Gorch to popular culture, and said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a reference that is probably lost to time...They weren't even famous then". In 2013, writer Jay Fosgitt marketed to publishing company Archaia Entertainment the idea of reviving The Land of Gorch characters in comic book format with a new storyline.|$|E
500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These are the kinds of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the kind of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{contemporary}} American {{poetry and}} her own risk-taking in her work she said: “Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry. At any rate, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> my goal—I mean I never want to say ‘I have plenty of heart,’ but I {{want to be able}} to say whatever I feel without fear or embarrassment.” ...|$|E

5000|$|... "We've {{always been}} about {{the music and the}} songs, and the {{expression}} of the human experience through music," [...] says Givant. [...] "But we've matured as musicians over time, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> <b>been</b> reflected in the music. We've learned <b>that</b> we don't all have to play crazy at all times, and we've learned to pick our moments to shine and deliver the songs in the most clear, concise and passionate way possible." ...|$|R
25|$|The Mistralian orthography of Provençal {{is more or}} less phonemic but not diasystemic and {{is closer}} to the French {{spelling}} and therefore more specific to Provençal; its users are divided between the ones <b>that</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Provençal <b>is</b> a part of Occitan and the ones <b>that</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Provençal <b>is</b> a separate language.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2013, Bush {{called for}} passage of {{immigration}} reform. [...] In April 2014, Bush said of illegal immigration: [...] "It's {{an act of}} love. It's an act of commitment to your family. I honestly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a different kind of}} crime. There should be a price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{think that}} {{that ought to be}} left up to the states. I {{personally}} do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a good idea, but I believe in many of these cases where there's real dispute in the country, these things {{are not going to be}} ever resolved. [...] People are going to have different ideas. That's why we have states. We ought to give great leeway to states and not have the federal government and not have the Supreme Court of the United States making social policy that's contrary to the traditions of this country and changing that overnight. And that's what's happened in a lot of these areas.|$|E
2500|$|RTÉ {{journalist}} Philip Boucher-Hayes said {{other media}} sources had misreported his words {{in order to}} erroneously claim that nuns had deliberately starved children to death: [...] "Today on BBC TV I said malnutrition was listed as cause of death at other mother-and-baby homes. Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Florence Blaustein, {{widow of}} the {{producer}} Julian Blaustein, said North {{had to pass}} a street called Baroda every day {{going to work and}} said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> how <b>that</b> <b>was</b> born." ...|$|R
2500|$|Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To <b>think</b> <b>that</b> oh you {{can look}} at a scandal and <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of {{credibility}} and talent <b>that</b> I had and wiped it out." ...|$|R

500|$|When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens {{started to}} move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public {{appearance}} and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to [...] "get the public to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a real person". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.|$|R
2500|$|One thing <b>that</b> {{would not}} count as {{evidence}} for the Anthropic Principle <b>is</b> evidence [...] <b>that</b> the Earth or the solar system occupied a privileged position in the universe, {{in violation of the}} Copernican principle (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see Copernican principle), unless there <b>was</b> some reason to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> position <b>was</b> a necessary condition for our existence as observers.|$|R

[...] "I’ve been composing now for over 40 years, and each song in a way takes you to this different place. Maybe some of them are dark, rich caves. Hopefully there’s a nice piano player sitting there taking your request in the cave." ...|$|R
40|$|Firstly, the {{situation}} of women in Galicia during the Franco dictatorship <b>is</b> analyzed. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> situation <b>was</b> really singular. Secondly, I study the type of women repression in Galicia, focusing on physical repression and prison, so I explain {{the kind of woman}} who suffered any of these types of repression. Finally, I describe the women’s prison space and living the conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Colombian {{government}} <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> accepting <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> an internalarmed {{conflict in}} the country implies recognizing internationalpersonality to the groups in arms against the legitimate government.

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{the reason}} altogether," [...] replied Forester. [...] "There {{was the man}} at the mill to-day, who said that I might take his boat and do any thing I chose to do with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{really do}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a fine idea--a splendid idea! The only {{drawback}} is, {{that in order}} to carry it out we should want a lot of strong cartridge-paper, and we have no paper except our note-books." ...|$|E

Akkub, the biblical {{name for this}} species, is already mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.|$|R
50|$|During {{the course}} of filming the documentary, Lisa and a few friends were {{passengers}} in a vehicle driven by her assistant. During the drive, a small boy ran {{out in front of}} the vehicle and was struck. The child died later <b>that</b> night.

6000|$|... "No {{doubt it}} will be {{dangerous}} work, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> likely to hinder Mark. The man, whoever he may be, is of course a desperate character, and {{not likely to be}} captured without making a fierce struggle for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> likely. You {{could safely}} {{have used the}} money, but as you have not--well, it is of small consequence. I presume that {{attempts}} have been made to withdraw the child from your care?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{asked if}} under the Foundation's {{interpretation}} of Flast a taxpayer could [...] "sue our Marshal for {{standing up and}} saying 'God save the United States and this honorable Court.'

And everything you thought you knew, the older you get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>that's</b> what I've <b>been</b> realizing these past few years." ...|$|R

A woman painted all this?... there's nothing sadistic here, instead what strikes the most is the impassibility of the painter, who was even able to notice how the blood, spurting with violence, can decorate with two drops the central spurt! Incredible I tell you! And also please give Mrs. Schiattesi—the conjugal name of Artemisia—the chance to choose the hilt of the sword! At last don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the only aim of Giuditta is to move away to avoid the blood which could stain her dress?
