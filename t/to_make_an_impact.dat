However, he contributed defensively, clearing a goal-bound shot from Christian Ziege off the line.|$|E
5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies {{were hard to}} come by as the season was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact,</b> scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{started his}} cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He {{struggled}} {{to break into}} the first team with his new county, and {{spent most of his time}} with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E

5|$|Challinor's first sending off for Cambridge {{came after}} {{receiving}} a second yellow card during a 5–0 home defeat to Crawley Town in the FA Trophy second round on 14 January 2009. He made his return from suspension in a 1–1 home draw with Oxford United on 29 January 2009. Challinor came on as a 79th-minute substitute for Paul Carden in the 2009 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, in which Torquay United won 2–0. Having struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> for Cambridge in 2008–09, which he finished with two goals in 39 appearances, he was transfer-listed.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact,</b> as Bedser removed him for one, and Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett was beaten in flight by Young and was caught by Washbrook. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Madhavan {{appeared}} in a supporting role as an Indian police officer in Fred Olen Ray's English film, Inferno, which was shot in India. His first chance in Indian cinema {{came in the form}} of Shanti Shanti Shanti (1998), a Kannada film, in which he appeared as a carefree youngster alongside actor Abbas. However, the film failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> and went unnoticed at the box office. During the period, Hindi film director Vinod Pandey launched Madhavan as a Bollywood hero, with a project titled Akeli, however the film was shelved before the production process had been completed.|$|E

Her figures were flattered by a haul of 3/32 in the final match of the season against Western Australia, in which she also made 26 to help seal a three-wicket win. Her batting continued to progress; she scored 149 runs at 29.80, including a best of 43 against Victoria. South Australia won five of their eight matches, again missing the finals.|$|E

David is not a frequent video game player, but stated that he has become more known for his work as the Arbiter than for his film and other voice roles.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{frustrated at}} his failure <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> at Newcastle, Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for £500,000. On {{his decision to}} leave Newcastle, Chopra stated that he had shown loyalty to the club and expressed his desire to receive the same loyalty from the club. He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future. During the season, Chopra scored 22 goals in 44 matches. He helped the club remain top of the Championship throughout September, earning the Championship Player of the month for September. He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season (an annual award given {{to a set of}} 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football).|$|E
5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{the back}} of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 {{campaign}} with the national team, Henry was ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, {{by the fact that he}} had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.|$|E

5|$|Following his loan spell at Fulham, Holtby {{returned}} to Tottenham {{and by the}} end of August 2014 had made three appearances, included in which were two in the Europa League. However, having struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> at White Hart Lane with Spurs, and after the club signed Benjamin Stambouli from Montpellier, Holtby elected to return to Germany to join Hamburg on loan the following month. In terms of the loan agreement, Hamburg retained the option to purchase Holtby outright for a fee of ₤6.5 million. Despite breaking his collarbone during the Rückrunde, Holtby made 22 Bundesliga appearances in his debut season for Hamburg and started in both legs of the club's relegation playoff victory over Karlsruher SC.|$|E
5|$|Hassett had a {{new role}} as the teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. He would improvise and open with Morris, as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who went on to score 81—on 25. Hassett {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> in the unfamiliar role, scoring 13 and 17. However, the other Australian batsmen stepped up and scored 3/404 in 330 minutes {{on the final day}} to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead. Hassett scored two fifties in the lead-up to the Fifth Test, where he returned to his customary role with the return of Barnes. Hassett took a diving catch in the first innings and scored 37 in an innings win. Australia thus won the series convincingly 4–0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44.29.|$|E
5|$|Having dropped Brown for the Test, Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Off spinner Ian Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact,</b> as Bedser removed him for one, before Pollard trapped Bradman leg before wicket (lbw) to leave Australia at 2/13. The tourists were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming at leg stump. Pollard {{was reinforced by}} Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter fell. Miller joined Morris and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps, with the latter—who had been the more sedate in the partnership—on 48.|$|E
