5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by <b>terror</b> <b>suspects,</b> and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor was in {{the news}} again for {{publicly}} criticising the new visa guidelines adopted by the Indian government {{in the wake of}} the gaps exposed by the arrest of 26/11 <b>terror</b> <b>suspects,</b> David Headley and Tahawwur Rana. For this he was criticised for breaking ranks with the official position of the government. He later met External Affairs Minister, S.M. Krishna, and explained his position on the issue. The rules were subsequently partly modified.|$|E

25|$|These {{were the}} first {{convictions}} {{anywhere in the world}} arising from the CIA's practice of abducting <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> and transferring them to third countries where torture occurred. The US had tried but failed to obstruct the prosecutions by Italy's independent Judiciary. Following the convictions the US used threats and diplomatic pressure to stop the Italian Executive branch from issuing arrest warrants and extradition requests for the Americans.|$|E
25|$|Habib was {{eventually}} released without charge. Following a plea bargain, Hicks was sentenced in 2007, {{by the military}} commission, for providing material support for terrorism, and was returned to Australia to serve the remaining nine months of his sentence, which expired in December 2007. As of May 2008, Hicks {{is the only one}} of the 517 foreign <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> held at Guantanamo to be convicted.|$|E
25|$|Cryer was re-elected in the 2001 and 2005 general elections. After the 2005 general election, she was {{a member}} of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

25|$|The European Parliament {{launched}} its own {{investigation into the}} reports. In April 2006, MEPs leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> to countries that used torture. Investigators said that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again. The Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2006 endorsing the Council of Europe's conclusions, midway through its own investigation into the alleged program.|$|E
25|$|However, even a {{government}} {{with a healthy}} majority can on occasion find itself unable to pass legislation. For example, on 9 November 2005, Tony Blair's Government was defeated over plans which would have allowed police to detain <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> for up to 90 days without charge, and on 31 January 2006, was defeated over certain aspects of proposals to outlaw religious hatred. On other occasions, the Government alters its proposals to avoid defeat in the Commons, as Tony Blair's Government did in February 2006 over education reforms.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, Abdirahman Farole {{was elected}} the new President of Puntland. Upon {{assuming}} office, the Farole administration implemented {{a number of}} reforms, particularly in the security and judicial sectors. To bolster the region's justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> and their accomplices; a special court {{is also expected to}} be established within the region's existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{began as}} an adviser to a {{publicly}} traded company, InferX which claims its technology is the answer to the U.S.A's security concerns, as well as the credibility problems of the DHS and FEMA. Brown has been on the media circuit talking about technology that claims to screen for <b>terror</b> <b>suspects,</b> track threats in shipping containers and cargo hauling, and gather data for law enforcement tracking. In December 2007, Brown was named CEO of InferX and then appointed {{to the board of directors}} in April 2008. As of May 9, 2008 Brown and others left the company pending sale of InferX to another investor.|$|E
25|$|The Defense Department's only {{official}} {{contact with}} Idema was accepting one prisoner who {{was held for}} a month by the US military but added that officials declined his offer {{to work with the}} government in capturing <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> in Afghanistan. In early 2004, Idema was in contact with Heather Anderson, the Pentagon's Acting Director of Security. Anderson was {{under the supervision of the}} chief official responsible for intelligence matters in Donald Rumsfeld's office. Idema told the Afghan court that Anderson commended his work but Anderson said she later turned down Idema's request to work in Afghanistan for the Pentagon. Idema continued to contact Anderson's office in hopes of establishing a relationship.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{rejection}} of a previous bill under Tony Blair's government to allow the detention of <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> for up to 90 days without charge, Brown championed a new bill extending the pre-charge detention period to 42 days. The bill was opposed {{on both sides of}} the House and Brown was facing a growing backbench rebellion. Jenny Percival wrote in The Guardian that Brown's critics accused him of [...] "vote-buying" [...] to ensure he won the vote on this issue. The bill was passed by nine votes, with Brown relying on the support of Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe and a handful of Democratic Unionist MPs.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning <b>terror</b> <b>suspects.</b> As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 July 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush {{signed an}} {{executive}} order banning torture during interrogation of <b>terror</b> <b>suspects.</b> While the guidelines for interrogation do not specifically ban waterboarding, the executive order refers to torture as defined by 18 USC 2340, which includes [...] "the threat of imminent death", {{as well as the}} U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Reaction to the order was mixed, with the CIA satisfied that it [...] "clearly defined" [...] the agency's authorities.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February, Dion's Liberals, {{together}} with Bloc Québécois and NDP members of Parliament, voted down a Harper government proposal to extend two controversial {{provisions of the}} Anti-Terrorism Act for another three years. Dion argued that the measures— which allowed police to arrest and detain <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> for three days without a warrant and which allowed judges to force witnesses to testify in terror cases— [...] "have done nothing to fight against terrorism" [...] and [...] "have not been helpful and have continued to create some risk for civil liberties." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, a Europol report {{showed that}} more than 99% of {{terrorist}} attacks in Europe {{over the last three}} years were, in fact, carried out by non-Muslims. Out of 1,009 arrests for terrorism in 2008, 187 were in relation to Islamist terrorism. The report showed that the majority of Islamist <b>terror</b> <b>suspects</b> were second or third generation immigrants. Swedish economist Tino Sanandaji has criticised the use of these statistics. According to a report by Europol on terrorism in the European Union, in 2016 [...] "nearly all reported fatalities and most of the casualties were the result of jihadist terrorist attacks." [...] A majority of about two-thirds of all terrorist-related arrests in the EU were also jihadist-related.|$|E
2500|$|The United Kingdom is also {{involved}} in combating Islamist terrorists in Somalia, since 2009, members of the Special Air Service and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment have been deployed to Camp Lemonnier to conduct counter-terrorist operations against Islamist terrorists in Somalia; they have carrying out surveillance missions of Britons believed to be travelling to Somalia for terrorist training and they are also working with US counterparts observing and [...] "targeting" [...] local <b>terror</b> <b>suspects.</b> They have also been carrying out a similar role in Yemen. In May 2016, {{it was reported that}} 70 UK military personnel are have arrived in Somalia to counter Al-Shabaab as part of a UN peacekeeping mission; 10 soldiers will offer medical, engineering and logistical support to AMISOM. Personnel will also be sent to South Sudan to carry out a similar role.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, Commander Shabir Hussain alleged being {{repeatedly}} {{rejected for}} promotion owing to racial discrimination, explicitly suggesting that Blair was using his influence to favour a [...] "golden circle" [...] of white officers and {{to turn down}} applications made by black and Asian candidates, who were better qualified for the promotion. In another case, the country's senior Asian police officer Tarique Ghaffur was considering commencing an employment tribunal over being sidelined by Sir Ian Blair in Olympics security planning, and being asked to keep quiet about his concerns about the new 42 days detention laws for <b>terror</b> <b>suspects.</b> In a subsequent press conference, Ghaffur claimed that in a face-to-face meeting with Blair, the latter threatened to remove him from his post if he went ahead with his legal action.|$|E
5000|$|The association’s {{external}} affairs secretary {{has said that}} no <b>terror</b> <b>suspect</b> had come from any Australian or international Ahmadiyya community.
