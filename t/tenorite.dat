50|$|If certain {{conditions}} were not met, the Egyptian blue {{would not be}} satisfactorily produced. For example, if the temperatures were above 1050 °C, it would become unstable. If too much lime was added, wollastonite (CaSiO3) forms and gives the pigment a green color. Too much of the copper ingredients results in excesses of copper oxides like cuprite and <b>tenorite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Paramelaconite is a rare, black-colored {{copper oxide}} mineral with formula Cu21+Cu22+O3 (or Cu4O3). It was {{discovered}} in the Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee, Arizona, about 1890.

5000|$|Owing to {{its unique}} appearance, Koenig {{assigned}} the mineral {{as a new}} species. His description of the mineral appeared in an 1892 publication of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He named the mineral paramelaconite from the Greek παρά, meaning [...] "near", and the mineral melaconite (now known as <b>tenorite),</b> for its compositional similarity to melaconite. At the time, however, the mineral was not recognized as a valid species.|$|E
50|$|Prior to World War I, Diyarbakır had {{an active}} copper industry, with six mines. Three were active, with two being owned by locals {{and the third}} being owned by the Turkish government. <b>Tenorite</b> was the primary type of copper mined. It was mined by hand by Kurds. A {{large portion of the}} ore was {{exported}} to England. The region also produced iron, gypsum, coal, chalk, lime, jet, and quartz, but primarily for local use.|$|E
50|$|Paramelaconite {{is black}} to black {{with a slight}} purple tint in color, and is white with a pinkish brown tint in {{reflected}} light. The mineral occurs with massive habit or as crystals up to 7.5 cm. A yellow color is formed when the mineral is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, a blue color when dissolved in nitric acid, and a slightly brown precipitate when exposed to ammonium hydroxide. When heated, paramelaconite breaks down into a mixture of <b>tenorite</b> and cuprite.|$|E
50|$|Ores most {{amenable}} to leaching include the copper carbonates malachite and azurite, the oxide <b>tenorite,</b> and the silicate chrysocolla. Other copper minerals, {{such as the}} oxide cuprite and the sulfide chalcocite may require addition of oxidizing agents such as ferric sulfate and oxygen to the leachate before the minerals are dissolved. The ores with the highest sulfide contents, such as bornite and chalcopyrite will require more oxidants and will dissolve more slowly. Sometimes oxidation is speeded by the bacteria Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, which feeds on sulfide compounds.|$|E

5000|$|Cuprite is an oxide mineral {{composed}} of copper(I) oxide Cu2O, {{and is a}} minor ore of copper.Its dark crystals with red internal reflections are in the isometric system hexoctahedral class, appearing as cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral forms, or in combinations. Penetration twins frequently occur. In spite of its nice color it is rarely used for jewelry because of its low Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4. It has a relatively high specific gravity of 6.1, imperfect cleavage and a brittle to conchoidal fracture. The luster is sub-metallic to brilliant adamantine. The [...] "chalcotrichite" [...] variety typically shows greatly elongated (parallel to 001) capillary or needle like crystals forms.It is a secondary mineral which forms in the oxidized zone of copper sulfide deposits.

It is known as ruby copper due to its distinctive red color.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAim is {{to assess}} the anti-biofilm {{property}} of <b>tenorite</b> nanoparticles and to study their suitability as a possible coating material for medical implants. <b>Tenorite</b> (CuO) nanoparticles were synthesized by the optimized thermal decomposition method and characterized using TEM, XRD, FTIR and UV–Vis analysis. Their influence on biofilm formation of microbes was studied by growing multi drug resistant bacterial strains in {{the presence or absence}} of these nanoparticles at various concentrations. The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on mammalian cells was studied at the corresponding concentrations. The nanoparticles were found to be uniformly dispersed, spherical shaped and < 50 nm in size. They showed various degrees of anti-biofilm property against clinically isolated, biofilm forming multi drug resistant microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Burkholderia mallei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, Hep- 2 cells showed excellent viability at <b>tenorite</b> nanoparticles concentration toxic to microbial growth. These results indicate that <b>tenorite</b> nanoparticles may be ideal candidates for being utilized as coating on medical implants in general and dental implants in particular...|$|E
30|$|The present (Zn,H)-codoped <b>tenorite</b> (CuO) {{nanoparticles}} with monoclinic {{crystal symmetry}} were also assembled as lenticular- or rice-shaped when the colloidal solution containing the (Zn,H)-codoped cuprite and amorphous phase besides metallic α-phase was dwelled {{in water for}} a prolonged time. We suggest that such a rice-like shape is due to (hkl)-specific assembly of the CuO nanoparticles formed {{at the expense of}} cuprite and amorphous nanocondensates. The coalescence growth of <b>tenorite</b> (ten) nanoparticles was preferred to occur over the close-packed (001)ten plane with periodic bond chains [37] presumably derived from (111)cup and/or (001)cup of cuprite (cup) in view of the reported crystallographic relationship for copper oxides [38]. Alternatively, <b>tenorite</b> nanoparticles could be nucleated from the (Zn,H)-codoped amorphous phase, i.e., atom clusters via precondensation, to form (200)ten and/or (111)ten surfaces for imperfect coalescence. The (111)-specific coalescence of <b>tenorite,</b> in fact, accounts for the (111) symmetrical tilt boundary (Figure[*] 8) with misfit dislocations at the interface. Such a planar interface would act as an energy cusp to prevent the coalesced nanoparticles from unification upon rapid cooling through the critical temperature for thermally activated Brownian rotation of the particles toward exact epitaxy [39].|$|E
30|$|The various defects {{by the two}} {{equations}} {{above and}} their clusters {{may account for the}} observed broad PL emission in the whole visible region for the (Zn,H)-codoped cuprite and <b>tenorite</b> (Figure[*] 9 c).|$|E
40|$|Azurite {{is a basic}} copper {{carbonate}} pigment largely {{employed in}} painting realization. The areas painted with azurite are easily alterable and are often less resistant than {{the other parts of}} artworks. The azurite alteration in a black pigment, the copper oxide (<b>tenorite),</b> has been studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The blackening can be due to thermal or chemical alterations: in the second case the alterations being due to the presence of alkaline conditions. Laser-induced degradation of azurite has been studied {{as a function of the}} grain size. The results show that the temperature of the grains decreases as the size increases, and azurite degrades into <b>tenorite</b> only below the critical value of 25 μm. To study the chemical alteration of azurite, the pigment has been applied on the plaster of terracotta samples and analyzed at different pH values by micro-Raman spectroscopy. As opposed to most part of the analytical techniques, it can detect the presence of both azurite and <b>tenorite</b> molecules in the same micro areas, and provides a valuable tool to determine azurite degradation...|$|E

The Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The average diameter of the spherical pure CuO nanoparticles and their crystallite size were estimated to be 92 nm and 40 nm, respectively.

40|$|The {{interaction}} mechanism between {{copper and}} propionic acid vapors is shown. Exposures {{were carried out}} to various pollutant concentrations and times. Cathodic scan, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electrode microscope (SEM) were used to quantify the degree of deterioration.

The hydration of the <b>tenorite</b> layer benefits {{the formation of a}} hydroxide compound such as CuOxH 2 O. As the pollutant level is increased, insoluble basic propionate is formed (Cu(OH) x(CH 3 CH 2 COO) 2 -x). Higher concentrations of propionic acid acidify the monolayers and a new compound Cu(CH 3 CH 2 COO) 2 H 2 O begins to precipitate at low pH, this is the main constituent of the green olive patina formed under these conditions. This mechanism agrees, in general terms, with those proposed in previous works to study the interaction between copper and the acetic and formic acids...|$|E

The transition temperature obviously increases steeply with a domain structure of ever narrower size, characterized by Fibonacci numbers. With this backing superconductivity above room temperature can be conceived for synthetic sandwich structures of _c less than 2 +. For instance, composites of <b>tenorite</b> and cuprite respectively <b>tenorite</b> and CuI (CuBr, CuCl) onto AuCu alloys are proposed. This specification is suggested by previously described filamentary superconductivity of 'bulk' CuO_ 1 -x samples. In addition, cesium substitution in the Tl- 1223 compound is an option. A low mean cationic charge allows the development of a frustrated nano-sized fractal structure of possible ferroelastic nature delivering nano-channels for the very fast charge transport, in common for both high-T_c superconductors and organic inorganic halide perovskite solar materials.

The latter was the main compound formed on corroded samples, forming thin tarnish films. | Metallurgists in Madrid, Spain, conducted a study to identify the corrosion products formed on the copper (dimensions = 4. 5 mm x 4 mm; thickness = 0. 4 mm) of TCu 380 IUDs during storage at room temperature for 30 months. They placed the IUD in a sealed bag and sterilized it with ethylene oxide at 40 degrees Celsius and a relative humidity of 35 %. The researchers used the experimental techniques of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy to characterize the copper surfaces and the approximate element composition of the surface as a function of depth. They compared an uncorroded copper- containing IUD of red color with a corroded copper- containing IUD of brown color. The techniques revealed that copper cuprite (Cu 2 O) formed the inner layer and that <b>tenorite</b> (CuO) formed the outermost layer. CuO was the main compound (about 73 %). Cu 2 O accounted for the red color on the uncorroded copper samples, while CuO accounted for the brown color on the corroded copper samples. CuO obstructs the diffusion of copper ions, which may reduce the effectiveness of a corroded copper IUD. During storage, copper-containing IUDs should be stored in completely sealed bags and under appropriate conditions of temperature and relative humidity to prevent copper corrosion.
