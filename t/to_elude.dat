5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses Tigranes suffered, {{the battle was}} not decisive in ending the war. In {{retreating}} northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans {{during the battle of}} Artashat. In 68, Lucullus' forces' began to mutiny, longing to return home, and he withdrew his forces from Armenia the following year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{important}} discoveries continued <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory, mainly due to {{its focus}} {{on the development of}} the cyclotron rather than its scientific use, through his increasingly larger machines, Lawrence was able to provide crucial equipment needed for experiments in high energy physics. Around this device, he built what became the world's foremost laboratory for the new field of nuclear physics research in the 1930s. He received a patent for the cyclotron in 1934, which he assigned to the Research Corporation, a private foundation that funded much of Lawrence's early work.|$|E
5|$|In November 1970, Power and Saxe {{became the}} sixteenth and seventeenth persons on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list. At first, Power and Saxe {{traveled}} together, escaping arrest by {{hiding out in}} women’s communes. For part of this time, the two went to ground in Connecticut and Power assumed the name Mae Kelly. Saxe was able <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> arrest until 1975, when she was captured in Philadelphia. She then served five years in prison.|$|E

When {{he and his brother}} Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate, they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them. The first challenge in the small band's search for a new home comes immediately, as they are forced <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> the Owsla, the warren's military caste.|$|E
5|$|The Coast Guard is {{focusing}} on retaining Hispanic and Spanish-speaking front-line workers as it aims to intercept illegal immigrants. The current Coast Guard workforce meets both diversity goals and operational demands for having Spanish-speaking workers on hand to communicate with apprehended illegal immigrants and human traffickers. These traffickers often pack people into boats and race along the Florida coastline, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> American enforcement.|$|E
5|$|The club won {{promotion}} to the First Division {{in their second}} season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and {{finished third in the}} First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point. Chelsea attracted large crowds and had a reputation for signing big-name players, but success continued <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> the club in the inter-war years.|$|E

After Hoxie surrenders, Riddick receives the codes to Hoxie's ship and Riddick and Johns escape disguised as a guard and prisoner. Two guards enter Hoxie's room, where Hoxie is bound and covered in Riddick's former attire. They mistake him for Riddick and kill him. Riddick and Johns take off in Hoxie's ship, ending the game.|$|E
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> aggressive bears.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after his}} release, Alfano left Naples and went from village to village <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> arrest. The Carabinieri located him in San Leucio, near Caserta, {{but he managed}} to escape. He fled to Rome, {{obtained}} a false passport and sailed for the United States from Marseilles, France. He disembarked on March 17, 1907, in New York disguised {{as a member of the}} ship's crew, posing as a stoker. In New York he began to run a gambling den in the basement of 108 Mulberry Street. He became one of the primary underworld targets of police sergeant Joseph Petrosino of the New York City Police Department, who believed Alfano to be a big player in the New York branch of the Camorra.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, 1832, {{a supply}} wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon. Around this time, Black Hawk and his 200-man war party also {{en route to}} the fort, had {{gathered}} at a gap in Terrapin Ridge. Black Hawk's forces were able <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> detection until the time they opened fire. At around 4 p.m. four couriers from Galena bound for the army camp at Dixon's Ferry arrived at the fort. The fort's occupants were eager to hear their news from Galena and of the conflict with Black Hawk.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{historian}} Tacitus describes Domitian's first {{speech in}} the Senate as brief and measured, {{at the same time}} noting his ability <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely , however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable men such as Arrecinus Clemens.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{she died}} in a hit and run car crash in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. Daniel Bark, aged 27, was later arrested and indicted for drunk and {{reckless}} driving, manslaughter and leaving {{the scene of an}} accident. Authorities later reported that Bark, who had a previous 2004 DUI conviction, was fleeing police when he struck and killed Cohen after failing to stop when a police officer on a bicycle ordered him to do so. Bark later accepted a plea bargain in November 2011 and pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>eluding</b> police and drunk driving. Prosecutors dismissed manslaughter and other charges in the 2009 traffic incident that killed Cohen. A judge had thrown out Bark's confession because police failed to advise him of his rights.|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods {{that allow them to}} successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E
5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in flocks of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|E

5|$|Mounted on a {{large scale}} under American command and {{involving}} nearly 15,000 troops, Paddington failed to result in significant contact, in spite of the employment of well co-ordinated search techniques and blocking forces. A large number of Viet Cong camps, bunkers and storage areas were however uncovered and destroyed, resulting in significant disruption to the communist logistic system. Under the overall command of Major General George G. O'Connor, commander US 9th Infantry Division, allied forces for Operation Paddington included the US 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, the 2nd Battalion, US 47th Infantry Regiment (Mechanised), the US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment, Task Force B Marine Corps (RVN) and the 1st Australian Task Force, as well as various supporting arms including two artillery batteries and more than a thousand armoured vehicles and helicopters. Viet Cong casualties included 92 killed, including 31 by 1 ATF for the loss of one Australian killed and another wounded. Nonetheless, the results were disappointing for the Australians, and the Viet Cong continued <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Now {{without the}} Hot Band or a {{recording}} contract, Sylvester set himself {{up with a}} new band, The Four As, and a new set of backing singers, two black drag queens named Jerry Kirby and Lady Bianca. With this new entourage, he continued to perform at a number of local venues including Jewel's Catch One, a predominantly black gay dance club on West Pico Avenue in Los Angeles, but reviewers were unimpressed with the new line-up, most of whom abandoned Sylvester in December 1974. After a brief sojourn in England, Sylvester returned to San Francisco and assembled three young drag queens to be backing singers: Arnold Elzie, Leroy Davis, and Gerry Kirby. Nevertheless, although he performed at such events as the 1975 Castro Street Fair, success continued <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> him, and he eventually fired Elzie, Davis, and Kirby.|$|E
5|$|Perry is the pet platypus of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is {{perceived}} as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life {{as a member of}} an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as the side of the house, most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem <b>to</b> <b>elude</b> the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii and North Dakota.
