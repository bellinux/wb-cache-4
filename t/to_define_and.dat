5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>and</b> {{assess the}} quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.|$|E
5|$|Two primary {{methods have}} been used <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>and</b> locate the G-spot as a {{sensitive}} area in the vagina: self-reported levels of arousal during stimulation, and stimulation of the G-spot leading to female ejaculation. Ultrasound technology has also been used to identify physiological differences between women and changes to the G-spot region during sexual activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between subspecies are small, making subspecific boundaries hard <b>to</b> <b>define,</b> <b>and</b> the exact distribution of S. a. heineken is unclear, since birds from northwest Africa {{may be of}} this form. About 2% of male blackcaps on Madeira and the Azores are melanistic, with black plumage on the whole head and upper breast. Melanistic females are rarer, and are characterised by grey-brown underparts. This dark morph has also been recorded from the Canary Islands, but not from Cape Verde. The melanistic birds were formerly sometimes {{considered to be a}} distinct subspecies, S. a. obscura.|$|E

5|$|This {{work was}} the first and only volume by Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas, and their {{intention}} was not only <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>and</b> describe the lands that were populated by Greeks, but also to describe the current social developments in the wider region. With this work they gave a precise delimitation of European Hellas (Greece) of that time, a few decades before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821). According to their description this area would not only include present-day Greece, but also Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and the southern half of Bulgaria, an area that included all the areas ruled by the Macedonian Kings, in addition to those of classical Greece incorporating most of the Orthodox populations of the Balkan peninsula, which was during that time under Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was {{finalized}} on 17 April 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing Empire to Japan. Taiwan's {{incorporation into}} the Japanese political orbit brought Taiwanese aborigines into contact with a new colonial structure, determined <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>and</b> locate indigenous people {{within the framework of}} a new, multi-ethnic empire. The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms: anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan, attempts to reshape the aborigines in the mould of the Japanese, and military suppression. The Aboriginals and Han joined together to violently revolt against Japanese rule in the 1907 Beipu Uprising and 1915 Tapani Incident.|$|E

25|$|Following the Brundtland Commission's report, one of {{the first}} {{initiatives}} to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by Swedish cancer scientist Karl-Henrik Robèrt. Robèrt coordinated a consensus process <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>and</b> operationalize sustainability. At the core of the process lies a consensus on what Robèrt came to call the natural step framework. The framework is based on a definition of sustainability, described as the system conditions of sustainability (as derived from System theory). In the natural step framework, a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth's crust, or substances produced by society; that does not degrade the environment and in which people have the capacity to meet their needs worldwide.|$|E
