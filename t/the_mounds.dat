5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b> They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|Large mounds up to 50 {{meters in}} {{diameter}} are found {{not only in}} Kraków, but also in Przemyśl and Sandomierz. among other places (about 20 total). They were probably funeral locations of rulers or chiefs, with the actual burial site, {{on the top of}} the mound, long lost. Besides <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> the degree of gord development and the grzywna treasure point to Kraków as the main center of Vistulan power (instead of Wiślica, as also suspected in the past).|$|E
5000|$|Their {{excavation}} of <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> {{determined that it}} was made of clay.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mound</b> system {{includes}} a septic tank, a dosing chamber, and a mound. Waste from homes {{is sent to}} the septic tank where the solid fraction settles {{to the bottom of the}} tank. The effluent is sent to a second tank called a dosing chamber, from which the effluent is distributed to <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> at a metered rate (in doses). Wastewater is partially treated as it moves through <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> sand. Final treatment and disposal occurs in the soil beneath <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mound</b> system can also better handle the effluent since it doesn't all come into <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> at once allowing it to clean the effluent better which helps to keep the system from failing.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that after the}} collapse of the Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD. The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD. Their settlements, like those of the Hopewell, were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds. Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River. The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> built by the Hopewell. The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region. The people also developed the bow and arrow and copper working during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of this piece of biomimicry is the structure of <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Story <b>Mound</b> is a Native American <b>mound</b> in <b>the</b> southwestern {{part of the}} U.S. {{state of}} Ohio.

50|$|<b>The</b> Freel Farm <b>Mound</b> {{is located}} on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Reservation. The site is {{currently}} inundated by Melton Hill Lake. At the time of excavation <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> was located on the William Freel farm 2 miles southeast of Scarboro, Tennessee. The site was located 1200 feet from the western side of the Clinch River in a wide valley with ridges to the east and west in a prominently wooded knoll.

5|$|Many pre-Columbian Native American {{societies}} of ancient North America built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds. Among {{the largest and}} best-known of these structures is Monks Mound {{at the site of}} Cahokia in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have {{played a central role in}} the mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public chief's house platforms, public temple platforms, mortuary platforms, charnel house platforms, earth lodge/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, {{while much of the}} city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes.

There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ant {{are known to}} capture {{termites}} {{to use as a}} fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, Formica nigra captures termites, and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E
50|$|In 1859, William Canfield {{became the}} first European settler to {{identify}} and survey <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b> His findings generated some interest due to several ongoing surveys of Wisconsin <b>mounds,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> faded from academic attention in the late 19th century.

5|$|By the 11th century, castles {{were built}} {{throughout}} the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically {{took the form}} of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.) The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France {{during the first half of}} the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gród, or town. Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the role of termites in the recycling of organic matter and in humification processes, organic matter from <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> of a wood-feeding termite (Nasutitermes sp.) and from the litter directly below has been studied in secondary forest on the campus of Belem University, in Brazil. The carbon content was slightly lower in the litter (just beneath <b>the</b> <b>mound)</b> than in <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> but nitrogen was much more abundant in <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b> As a consequence, the C/N ratio of fragmented litter total organic matter is very high, which shows that the humification process is not complete. Therefore, plant debris seemed to be more degraded in <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> than in <b>the</b> litter, indicating a humification gradient from mound to litter. Humic acid extracted from <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> and from <b>the</b> litterwas compared by using elemental, E 4 /E 6 ratio, spectroscopic (FTIR) analyses, and Sephadex gel chromatography. First, humic acids were more abundant in <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> than in <b>the</b> litter, showing that humification processes were more advanced in <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> than in <b>the</b> litter. Gel-permeation chromatography showed that the humic acids of <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> contained more low-molecular-weight fractions than those of the litter. In addition, the results of infrared spectra, E 4 /E 6 ratio and elemental composition can confirm the fulvic character of <b>mound</b> material and <b>the</b> humic character of litter material. Therefore, the plant debris seems to follow two different humification pathways in the two environments, as long as <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> is alive...|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> other <b>mounds</b> at Pineland, {{which were}} shell middens, <b>the</b> Smith <b>Mound</b> is a sand mound with thin layers of shell, {{and was used}} for burials. <b>The</b> Smith <b>Mound</b> was {{originally}} about 300 ft long and 30 ft high.

5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have also}} been experimenting with other methods, such as fumigation, injecting <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> mound {{drenching}}, and surface dusting.
