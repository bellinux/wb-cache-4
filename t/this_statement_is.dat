5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, <b>this</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> inference as their diet isn't described. All that is known is that it sticks to the ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E

25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, <b>this</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> {{evidence}} that (2) {{if something is}} not black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) <b>this</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.|$|E

25|$|Whether <b>this</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true {{or false}} is {{independent}} of ZFC set theory, so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent {{if and only if}} ZFC is consistent.|$|E
25|$|Light particles, or photons, {{travel at}} the speed of c, the {{constant}} that is conventionally known as the speed of light. <b>This</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a light-like world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.|$|E
25|$|Dobie in 1876 {{records that}} Hugh, Earl of Eglinton {{inherited}} in May 1661 the 10 merkland of Langshaw with the patronage of the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin within these lands. A reference {{is made to}} a James Wyllie, whose family held these lands for several generations. <b>This</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> made {{as part of a}} reference to the 5 merk lands of Gallaberry which were part of a larger area of land, most of which belonged to the estate of Dunlop. The name Gallaberry is thought to be derived from the Saxon word burgh and the Celtic word Gauls, the term meaning therefore the burgh, mansion or strength of the Gauls. Sanderson mentions a rural chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mother Mary located on the Lainshaw lands.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Heisenberg {{proved that}} this last {{assumption}} is not correct. Quantum mechanics shows that certain pairs of physical properties, such as for example position and speed, cannot be simultaneously measured, nor defined in operational terms, to arbitrary precision: the more precisely one property is measured, or defined in operational terms, the less precisely can the other. <b>This</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> {{known as the}} uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle isn't only a statement about the accuracy of our measuring equipment, but, more deeply, is about the conceptual nature of the measured quantities– {{the assumption that the}} car had simultaneously defined position and speed does not work in quantum mechanics. On a scale of cars and people, these uncertainties are negligible, but when dealing with atoms and electrons they become critical.|$|E
25|$|Florus {{calls it}} the urbs urbinum, or capital of Sardinia, and {{represents}} it as taken and severely punished by Gracchus, but <b>this</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> wholly at variance with Livy's account of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes. In the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, the citizens of Caralis {{were the first to}} declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia; and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa. A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of Menas, the lieutenant of Sextus Pompeius, Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.|$|E
25|$|In {{thermodynamic}} terms, {{temperature is}} an intensive variable {{because it is}} equal to a differential coefficient of one extensive variable with respect to another, for a given body. It thus has the dimensions of a ratio of two extensive variables. In thermodynamics, two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a common wall, which has some specific permeability properties. Such specific permeability {{can be referred to}} a specific intensive variable. An example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat; the intensive variable for this case is temperature. When the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time, and have settled to a permanent steady state, the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies; for a diathermal wall, <b>this</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.|$|E

500|$|The {{beginnings}} of cricket's social division between amateurs and professionals, {{from which the}} annual Gentlemen v Players contest ultimately evolved, {{can be traced to}} the reign of Charles I.
