5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as pets and for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, a practice <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants {{have long been}} used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E

There was another service station, in the main street, but it closed in 2008 after operating for approximately forty years. Rutherglen is a holiday village, conference and event centre, and retirement village on the town's west. It is the only premises in Hadspen with a general liquor licence. Rutherglen, or a similarly named premises at the same location, {{has been used for}} accommodation since at least 1923. The town has access to reticulated water and sewerage. The town's sewerage has been, since the mid-1970s, processed at a plant near Carrick that also serves that town. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into a tributary of the Liffey River.|$|E

5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
5|$|Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders {{ignored the}} command, and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge {{the death of}} his former comrade. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and {{slaughtered}} 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> thousands of deaths. Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization. With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories.|$|E

25|$|In some of {{the larger}} Tudor style houses the Tudor great hall would be {{suggested}} by the reception hall, often furnished as a sitting or dining room. Large wooden staircases of several flights were often prominently positioned, based on Jacobean prototypes. It is this mingling of styles <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the term Jacobethan which resulted in houses such as Harlaxton Manor which bore little if any resemblance to a building from either period.|$|E
25|$|A multi-locus {{molecular}} {{study by}} Jörger et al. (2010), included {{six out of}} seven acochlidian families. It confirmed Acochlidiacea in a pulmonate relationship, as sister to Eupulmonata. Euthyneura, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata as traditionally defined were found non-monophyletic. The enigmatic amphibious and insectivorous Aitengidae clusters within Acochlidiacea, as sister to meiofaunal and brackish Pseudunelidae and limnic Acochlidiidae. Inclusion of this small acochlidian group resulted in redefinition of major groups within Heterobranchia, <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> creation of the new clades Euopisthobranchia and Panpulmonata.|$|E

The Eddy Street Commons drew union protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union workers. The developer, Kite Realty out of Indianapolis, has made agreements with major national chains rather than local businesses, a move <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> criticism from alumni and students.|$|E

25|$|In traditional/folk music, fado {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact, with Amália Rodrigues still the most recognizable Portuguese name in music, and with more recent acts, like Dulce Pontes and Mariza. The genre {{is one of two}} Portuguese music traditions in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, with the other being Cante Alentejano. Regional folk music remains popular too, having been updated and modernized in many cases, especially in the northeastern region of Trás-os-Montes. Some more recent successful fado/folk-inspired acts include Madredeus and Deolinda, the later being part of a folk revival <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a newfound interest in this type of music.|$|E

25|$|Hafeez was {{originally}} suspended from bowling in November 2014. Following remedial {{work on his}} bowling action, he was reassessed and permitted to resume bowling in April 2015.

Hafeez is entitled to appeal any procedural aspect of an independent assessment <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> this automatic suspension.

25|$|With 189 water basins and {{an average}} {{rainfall}} of over 2000-4000mm per year, Malaysia is prone to riverine, muddy floods that range from hours-long flash floods, to prolonged flooding on flat, low-lying land along major tributaries and main stems. There have been 15 instances of major flooding in Malaysia since 1926. Flooding {{has been a major}} concern in recent decades due to rapid development in river catchment areas <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> increased surface and river runoffs, increased sediment buildup in rivers, and a higher risk of overflowing rivers. The 2006 and 2007 flooding in Johor has resulted in loss of RM1.5 billion and 18 lives in addition to the temporary displacement of 110,000 people.|$|E
