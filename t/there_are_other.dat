5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem {{implies that the}} existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic.

This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
