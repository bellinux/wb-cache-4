It is sometimes called a structure or aggregate <b>data</b> <b>type,</b> although the latter term may also refer to arrays, lists, etc. The act of constructing a composite type is known as composition.|$|R
5000|$|Metafile is a [...] {{term for}} a file format that can store {{multiple}} types of data. This commonly includes graphics file formats. These graphics files can contain raster, vector, and <b>type</b> <b>data.</b> A common use for these files is to provide support for an operating system's computer graphics; e.g., Microsoft Windows uses Windows Metafile, and Mac OS X uses PDF.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} programming languages, [...] is a frequently used generic label used in templates to reference an unknown data <b>type,</b> <b>data</b> structure, or class. Templates {{are most frequently}} used in Java and C++. TypeParameter {{is similar to a}} metasyntactic variable (e.g., [...] and [...] ), but distinct. It is not the name of a generic variable, but the name of a generic type of variable.|$|E

50|$|However {{one problem}} of cloud service {{provisioning}} {{is that it}} is not instantaneous. A cloud VM can be acquired at any time by the user, but it may take up to several minutes for the acquired VM to be ready to use. The VM startup time is dependent on factors, such as image size, VM <b>type,</b> <b>data</b> center location, number of VMs, etc. Cloud providers have different VM startup performance.|$|E
50|$|Amazon's {{auto-scaling}} {{feature of}} EC2 {{allows it to}} automatically adapt computing capacity to site traffic. The schedule-based (e.g. time-of-the-day) and rule-based (e.g. CPU utilization thresholds) auto scaling mechanisms are {{easy to use and}} efficient for simple applications. However, one potential problem is that VMs may take up to several minutes to be ready to use, which are not suitable for time critical applications. The VM startup time are dependent on image size, VM <b>type,</b> <b>data</b> center locations, etc.|$|E
50|$|Clusterpoint {{database}} enables {{to perform}} transactions in a distributed document database {{model in the}} same way as in a SQL database. Users can perform secure real-time updates, free text search, analytical SQL querying and reporting at high velocity in very large distributed databases containing XML or JSON document <b>type</b> <b>data.</b> Transactions are implemented without database consistency issues plaguing most of NoSQL databases and can safely run at high-performance speed previously available only with relational databases. Real time Big data analytics, replication, loadsharing and high-availability are standard features of Clusterpoint database software platform.|$|E
50|$|A new <b>data</b> <b>type</b> can be added, {{possibly}} with default <b>data</b> <b>type</b> ID, {{as long as}} {{the default}} <b>data</b> <b>type</b> ID doesn’t conflict with one of the existing <b>data</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{local area}} network (LAN) is built using a fiber optic cable. Technics and {{technologies}} applied for LAN development made possible to create the universal telecommunication medium. Its functions are transferring and switching of traffic of any <b>type</b> (<b>data,</b> voice and video) and providing an unlimited set of services under the standard rules and protocols. This medium has a services creation, control, personalization capability. Now, more than 1,750 computers {{are connected to the}} LAN, 40 servers and 110 units of network equipment are constituent part of the united network.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1980s, {{databases}} {{were viewed}} as computer systems that stored record oriented and business <b>type</b> <b>data</b> such as manufacturing inventories, bank records, sales transactions, etc. A database system was not expected to merge numeric data with text, images, or multimedia information, nor was it expected to automatically notice patterns in the data it stored. In the late 1980s {{the concept of an}} intelligent database was put forward as a system that manages information (rather than data) in a way that appears natural to users and which goes beyond simple record keeping.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1980s, content {{analysis}} {{has become an}} increasingly important tool in the measurement of success in public relations (notably media relations) programs and the assessment of media profiles, such as political media slant—orientation towards {{one of the two}} major parties. In 1982, John Naisbitt published his popular Megatrends, based on {{content analysis}} in the US media. In analyses of this <b>type,</b> <b>data</b> from content analysis is usually combined with media data (circulation, readership, number of viewers and listeners, frequency of publication). It has also been used by futurists to identify trends.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, an opaque <b>data</b> <b>type</b> is a <b>data</b> <b>type</b> whose concrete <b>data</b> {{structure is}} not defined in an interface. This enforces information hiding, since its values {{can only be}} manipulated by calling subroutines that {{have access to the}} missing information. The concrete representation of the type is hidden from its users, and the visible implementation is incomplete. A <b>data</b> <b>type</b> whose representation is visible is called transparent. Opaque <b>data</b> <b>types</b> are frequently used to implement abstract <b>data</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, a <b>type</b> family associates <b>data</b> <b>types</b> {{with other}} <b>data</b> <b>types,</b> using a type-level function defined by an open-ended collection of valid instances of input types {{and the corresponding}} output types.|$|R
5000|$|Explicit <b>data</b> <b>typing</b> {{is seldom}} {{seen in the}} {{majority}} of YAML documents since YAML autodetects simple <b>types.</b> <b>Data</b> <b>types</b> can be divided into three categories: core, defined, and user-defined. Core are ones expected to exist in any parser (e.g. floats, ints, strings, lists, maps, ...). Many more advanced <b>data</b> <b>types,</b> such as binary data, are defined in the YAML specification but not supported in all implementations. Finally YAML defines a way to extend the <b>data</b> <b>type</b> definitions locally to accommodate user-defined classes, structures or primitives (e.g. quad-precision floats).|$|R
50|$|One {{potential}} {{problem is that}} elasticity takes time. A cloud virtual machine (VM) can be acquired at any time by the user, however, it may take up to several minutes for the acquired VM {{to be ready to}} use. The VM startup time is dependent on factors, such as image size, VM <b>type,</b> <b>data</b> center location, number of VMs, etc. Cloud providers have different VM startup performance. This implies any control mechanism designed for elastic applications must consider in its decision process the time needed for the elasticity actions to take effect, such as provisioning another VM for a specific application component.|$|E
5000|$|IBM {{claims that}} {{enterprise}} multi-level cell flash plus Variable Stripe RAID and other IBM reliability technology forms a good balance between reliability and economics for most enterprise environments. IBM Variable Stripe RAID is a patented highly granular RAID 5 <b>type</b> <b>data</b> protection arrangement implemented across {{each set of}} 10 flash chips in the system. IBM FlashSystem 840, 820, and 720 products also include a second layer of RAID 5 implemented within the data distribution logic at the system level, providing [...] "two-dimensional" [...] data protection within the system. IBM claims that this two-dimensional protection is strongly differentiated within the industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{constructor}} has two parts. First is the initializer list {{which follows}} the parameter list {{and before the}} method body. It starts with a colon and entries are comma-separated. The initializer list is not required, but offers the opportunity to provide values for data members and avoid separate assignment statements. The initializer list is required if you have const or reference <b>type</b> <b>data</b> members, or members {{that do not have}} parameterless constructor logic. Assignments occur according to the order in which data members are declared (even if the order in the initializer list is different). The second part is the body, which is a normal method body enclosed in curly brackets.|$|E

50|$|Although Excel {{nominally}} {{works with}} 8-byte numbers by default, VBA has {{a variety of}} <b>data</b> <b>types.</b> The Double <b>data</b> <b>type</b> is 8 bytes, the Integer <b>data</b> <b>type</b> is 2 bytes, and the general purpose 16 byte Variant <b>data</b> <b>type</b> can be converted to a 12 byte Decimal <b>data</b> <b>type</b> using the VBA conversion function CDec. Choice of variable types in a VBA calculation involves consideration of storage requirements, accuracy and speed.|$|R
