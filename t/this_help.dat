5|$|During this stage, Antoine Fauré lead {{close to}} his hometown, and 200 fans {{tried to stop the}} rest of the cyclists from {{following}} him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of <b>this</b> <b>help,</b> Fauré was the first on top of the Col de la République, but was taken over by the favourites later. Aucouturier won the sprint. When the riders reached Marseille, they complained that there had been too many incidents in this stage, and the stage results should be cancelled. In the last part, they had been stopped by a large group of cyclists. Maurice Garin had been attacked, and his arm had been injured: he finished the stage steering with only one hand. There was so much confusion at the last controle post, that the exact arrival times of the cyclists were not recorded.|$|E
5|$|FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{has made}} a name for himself working on X-Files—unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is {{appointed}} a partner in these investigations—Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information. <b>This</b> <b>help</b> is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. Deep Throat is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.|$|E

During his first trip he had encountered a holy man who prophesied that he would only reach Mecca by travelling through Syria. The diversion held an added advantage; because of the holy places that lay along the way, including Hebron, Jerusalem, and Bethlehem, the Mamluk authorities spared no efforts in keeping the route safe for pilgrims. Without <b>this</b> <b>help</b> many travellers would be robbed and murdered.|$|E
25|$|Vélez {{affiliated}} to the Argentine Football Association (AFA) in 1912. Nonetheless, on 5 September, {{the board}} decided to disaffiliate the club from AFA and affiliate {{it to the}} recently created Federación Argentina de Football (FAF), citing as reason AFA's detrimental attitude towards the club. In that same year, the team was strengthened by the joining of some former players of San Lorenzo de Almagro, who had left that club due to its internal problems. With <b>this</b> <b>help,</b> Vélez reached the Federation's second division championship final on {{their first year of}} affiliation, losing 2–4 to Tigre in GEBA's ground.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} vintage {{variation}} due to the reliability of favorable weather with little risk of summer time frost or harvest time rains. The main exception, again, is Casablanca {{due in part to}} its proximity to the Pacific. For the Chilean wine regions in the Valle Central, the Andes and Coastal Ranges create a rain shadow effect which traps the warm arid air in the region. At night, cool air comes into the area from the Andes which dramatically drops the temperature. <b>This</b> <b>help</b> maintain high levels of acidity to go with the ripe fruit that grapes develop with the long hours of uninterrupted sunshine that they get during the day. The result is a unique profile of flavonoids in the wine which some Chilean wineries claim make Chilean wines higher in resveratrol and antioxidants. Harvest typically begins at the end of February for varieties like Chardonnay with some red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon being picked in April and Carmenère sometimes staying on the vine into May.|$|E

The Artillery Company was a focal point in the colony for people who {{disagreed}} with the orthodoxy of the colony's Puritan leaders. [...] Many of its leading members, Leverett among them, opposed the colonial crackdowns on religious dissenters. [...] Its members also engaged in trade. [...] Leverett frequently partnered with Edward Gibbons and Major General Robert Sedgwick in trading ventures. [...] He was, for example, part owner with Gibbons of a ship lost off the Virginia coast. [...] The mixture of military leadership and commercial enterprise sometimes led to conflicts of interest. [...] In the 1640s, Gibbons convinced Governor John Winthrop to allow Massachusetts volunteers to assist French Acadian Governor Charles de la Tour in his dispute with Charles de Menou d'Aulnay.

500|$|During Linnaeus' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, {{he taught}} many devoted students, 17 {{of whom he}} called [...] "apostles". They were the most promising, most {{committed}} students, {{and all of them}} made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of <b>this</b> <b>help</b> varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition. To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus' new system, {{it would not have been}} possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.|$|E

One evening found him deep in conversation at the officers club, planning the engineering aspects of an upcoming test series with the project pilot for the XF-91 rocket-assisted fighter program. Four master's degree hopefuls from MIT were seated at a nearby table, fretting at their inability to solve a complex problem which they had been assigned.

Cuba has the second-highest per capita number of physicians in the world ( [...] behind Italy [...] ). The country sends {{tens of thousands of}} doctors to other countries as aid, as well as to obtain favorable trade terms.

2500|$|Under the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), {{the last}} dynasty of {{imperial}} rule, local government {{became even more}} tightly stretched as population and wealth grew but government administrative institutions – and tax revenue – did not.

In the 1720s the Yongzheng Emperor allowed the magistrate to deduct [...] "meltage fees" [...] from the land tax he was required to remit, but this {{did not address the}} structural problem. [...] The unintended result was that by the early 19th century, major functions of local government had been abandoned by harried and underpaid magistrates and left to the gentry, who mediated disputes, supervised schools and irrigation works, organized local militia, and even collected taxes. Although magistrates were grateful to have <b>this</b> <b>help,</b> the local gentry often used these functions to reward themselves and punish their enemies.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} he {{returned}} from service in the Allied forces of World War I, very little remained of Mussolini the socialist. Indeed, he was now convinced that socialism as a doctrine had largely been a failure.

In early 1918 Mussolini called for the emergence of a man [...] "ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep" [...] to revive the Italian nation. Much later Mussolini said he felt by 1919 [...] "Socialism as a doctrine was already dead; it continued to exist only as a grudge".
