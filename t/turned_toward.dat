5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juliette was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} and final tropical cyclone of the inactive 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The tenth named storm of the season, Juliette formed on September16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico. For {{the majority of its}} track, the storm moved toward the west-northwest, and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status. On September20, the hurricane reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h). Later it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula, although the hurricane never affected land.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the planets}} in the Solar System have {{secondary}} systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> their parent.|$|E

5|$|On February10, MFR began {{tracking}} {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Mozambique channel near Juan de Nova Island. The system tracked generally south-southwestward, gradually intensifying. Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the southeastern African coastline {{and approached the}} eastern coasts of Mozambique and South Africa as a weakened system. A ridge caused the storm {{to turn to the}} east and northeast, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast of Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to continental Europe, Forster <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> academia. He traveled to Paris {{to seek out}} a discussion with the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on botany and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele was {{the first}} cyclone of {{tropical}} cyclone status to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Fame one year prior. It formed on January18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and rapidly organized as it remained nearly stationary. Fanele ultimately <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185km/h (115mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and rapidly weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hattie first posed {{a threat}} to the Yucatán Peninsula and British Honduras on October30 when it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the {{potential}} for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E

The two highways pass through the town of Campo, and make an interchange with U.S. 160 {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. In Lamar and Carlton, the highways make an interchange with U.S. 50. Here U.S. 385 heads east on U.S. 50, and U.S. 287-U.S. 50 continue to the North. Just outside the town the highways make a sharp <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> the west, and the road heading north is CO 196. South of Wiley, U.S. 50 heads west, while U.S. 287 <b>turns</b> north <b>toward</b> Wiley. East of Eads, Colorado U.S. 287 <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the west again, briefly merging with C-96. In Eads C-96 continues toward the West, while U.S. 287 <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the North. Near Kit Carson, U.S. 287 again <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the west and merges with U.S. 40. Near Limon, the two highways make 2 interchanges with I-70 before passing through Limon. Then the two highways merge with I-70.

5|$|On September28, 1898, island {{stations}} in the Lesser Antilles indicated {{the presence of a}} tropical cyclone, which was confirmed by the next day. Modern researchers determined that the system developed on September25 about 220miles (350km) east of Guadeloupe. For most of its duration, the system maintained a northwest track, reaching hurricane status on September27. Later that day, a barometric pressure of 977mbar, suggesting winds of 90mph (150km/h). Its intensification rate slowed on September28, before strengthening continued on October1. The winds reached 115mph (185km/h), which is the equivalent of a major hurricane, or Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around that time, the hurricane <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> more to the west-northwest, due to a large ridge across the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Japanese {{landings}} were seaplanes from Kamikawa Maru, temporarily {{based at}} Thousand Ships Bay at Santa Isabel Island. About 400 Japanese naval troops—mainly from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force—disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from Shōhō covered the landings until early afternoon, when Gotō's force <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> Bougainville to refuel in preparation {{to support the}} landings at Port Moresby. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six seaplanes landed in Tulagi harbor {{as part of the}} establishment of the planned seaplane base there.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Oman cyclone (also {{known as}} Cyclone 02A) was a {{tenacious}} and deadly system that caused historic flooding {{in the southern}} Arabian Peninsula. It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record. After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June11. Later that day, it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. It weakened over land, dissipating on June12, although it continued to produce rainfall – heavy at times – {{over the next few}} days.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} slowly intensified as it traveled offshore, {{continuing to}} strengthen {{throughout the day}} on June 17, eventually reaching Category 2 status by June 18. As the storm headed northeastward, the hurricane began to weaken, becoming a tropical storm by June 21. The system <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the east-southeast on June 21, later recurving towards the east-northeast on June 22. It weakened to a tropical depression by June 23, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. Impacts caused by the hurricane were minimal—a boat was partially dismantled at Key West, and a wharf at Coconut Grove was also damaged. In addition, the schooner Hidie Feroe sank, although her crew was later rescued.|$|E
5|$|The remnant low of a {{depression}} emerged into the Arabian Sea off Kerala late on November 21 and {{developed into a}} new depression the next day as it moved west. The depression moved further west, and gradually <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the southwest, intensifying as it did so. It became a cyclonic storm on November 28 to the southeast of Socotra and reached its peak with 75km/h (25mph) winds soon after. The cyclone continued to move west-southwestwards and rapidly weakened into a remnant low pressure area off the Somalia coast the next day, ending the season.|$|E
5|$|When Tropical Storm Andres first {{turned to}} the northeast, {{tropical}} storm warnings were issued from Punta Galera, Mexico to the Mexico/Guatemala border. A tropical storm warning was later issued from Champerico, Guatemala to the Mexican border. All of the warnings were dropped when Andres <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the southeast. Later, a tropical storm watch was issued for Guatemala and El Salvador, but it was quickly canceled. Due {{to the threat of}} the storm, officials closed ports along the southern Mexican coastline, and also advised for small boats to excise caution.|$|E
