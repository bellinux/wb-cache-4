In 1954, American Motors was formed when Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in a deal worth almost $200 million, the largest corporate merger in United States history at that time.|$|E
5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday Night Football gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010 offseason, the Miami Heat re-signed {{team captain}} Dwyane Wade and added free agents Chris Bosh and LeBron James to form <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three.</b> The Heat were then {{considered}} the favorites {{by many to}} win multiple championships, appearing {{in the next four}} finals, and winning two, in 2012 and 2013.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new series for <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks. They started creating live action series, {{instead of just}} animation ones, and also series that combined both. While {{a majority of the}} series was animated, live-action segments involving actual animals were also included to separate different scenes in an episode. According to Scheimer, filming with the animals was tough, as the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase the cats on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} in 1866 as a printer of {{standardized}} business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s. This {{was followed by a}} major down-sizing of the printing division and subsequent advancements in its software products. By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting in a culture clash between the two companies.|$|E
5|$|Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> {{television}} networks, {{the local}} {{stations in the}} NTA Film Network were not connected via coaxial cable or microwave relay. Instead, NTA Film Network programs were filmed and then mailed to each station in the network, a method used by television syndicators in the 1950s and 1960s. However, many local stations agreed to broadcast NTA Film Network programs in pattern (simultaneously). Landau's claim to network status {{was based on the}} simultaneous airing of the programs.|$|E

5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its short run, it was {{broadcast}} on <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while others found it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those belonging to <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have}} a camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day Kennedy and Clark {{drove into the}} Delta area, while the other senators flew back to Washington D.C. They were accompanied by Evers, Wright, Moore, Edelman, Carr, {{a dozen or so}} reporters from state and national newspapers and <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks, and an assortment of U.S. Marshals, state highway patrolmen, and local police. That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in Greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers. After lunch, Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80mph down U.S. Route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore.|$|E

5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive price cutting by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The price cutting promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own price cutting program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>three</b> chains.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E
