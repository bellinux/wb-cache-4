5|$|Barbera took art {{classes at}} the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired {{to work in the}} ink and paint {{department}} of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades, and <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Jerry. This <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio.|$|E

40|$|The preprotein {{translocase}} of {{the outer}} mitochondrial membrane (Tom) is a multisubunit machinery containing receptors and a general import pore (GIP). We have analyzed the molecular architecture of the Tom machinery. The receptor Tom 22 stably associates with Tom 40, {{the main component of}} the GIP, in a complex with a molecular weight of ∼ 400, 000 (∼ 400 K), while the other receptors, <b>Tom</b> 20 <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 70, are more loosely associated with this GIP complex and can be found in distinct subcomplexes. A yeast mutant lacking both <b>Tom</b> 20 <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 70 can still form the GIP complex when sufficient amounts of Tom 22 are synthesized. Besides the essential proteins <b>Tom</b> 22 <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 40, the GIP complex contains three small subunits, Tom 5, <b>Tom</b> 6, <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 7. In mutant mitochondria lacking Tom 6, the interaction between <b>Tom</b> 22 <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 40 is destabilized, leading to the dissociation of <b>Tom</b> 22 <b>and</b> the generation of a subcomplex of ∼ 100 K containing Tom 40, <b>Tom</b> 7, <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 5. Tom 6 is required to promote but not to maintain a stable association between <b>Tom</b> 22 <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 40. The following conclusions are suggested. (i) The GIP complex, containing Tom 40, <b>Tom</b> 22, <b>and</b> three small <b>Tom</b> proteins, forms the central unit {{of the outer}} membrane import machinery. (ii) <b>Tom</b> 20 <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> 70 are not essential for the generation of the GIP complex. (iii) Tom 6 functions as an assembly factor for Tom 22, promoting its stable association with Tom 40...|$|R
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Jerry had been so successful.|$|E

5|$|While Ike Clanton {{later said}} he was {{planning}} to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. Will McLaury, <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Frank's brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shootout that <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers' murder. Paul Johnson told a different story, that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline, in Iowa. <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year.|$|E
