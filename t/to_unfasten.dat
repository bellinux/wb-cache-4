2500|$|The {{writings}} of the early church contain strong condemnations of same-sex acts. Tertullian wrote, [...] "When Paul asserts that males and females changed among themselves the natural use of the creature in that which is unnatural, he validates the natural way”. Ambrosiaster wrote, “Paul tells us that these things came about, that a woman should lust after another woman, because God was angry at the human race because of its idolatry. Those who interpret this differently {{do not understand the}} force of the argument. For what is it to change the use of nature into a use which is contrary to nature, if not to take away the former and adopt the latter, so that the same part of the body should be used by each of the sexes in a way for which it was not intended?... It is clear that, because they changed the truth of God into a lie, they changed the natural use (of sexuality) into that use by which they were dishonored and condemned". John Chrysostom wrote, [...] "No one can say that it was by being prevented from legitimate intercourse that they came to this pass or that it was from having no means to fulfill their desire that they were driven to this monstrous insanity... What is contrary to nature has something irritating and displeasing in it, so that they could not even claim to be getting pleasure out of it. For genuine pleasure comes from following what is according to nature. But when God abandons a person to his own devices, then everything is turned upside down.” Cyprian wrote, [...] "If you were able... to direct your eyes into secret places, <b>to</b> <b>unfasten</b> the locked doors of sleeping chambers and to open these hidden recesses to the perception of sight, you would behold that being carried on by the unchaste which a chaste countenance could not behold. You would see that it is in an indignity even to see... Men with frenzied lusts rush against men. Things are done which cannot even give pleasure to those who do them.” ...|$|E

50|$|Shortly after launch, {{scientists}} {{found that the}} Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open.

The experiment was still able to collect some data using the properly functioning Scanning Electron Spectrometer.|$|R

50|$|After {{failing to}} get re-elected, Mitchel joined the Air Service as a flying cadet, {{completing}} training in San Diego and obtaining {{the rank of}} major. On the morning of July 6, 1918, when returning from a short military training flight to Gerstner Field, near Lake Charles, Louisiana, his plane suddenly went into a nose dive, causing Mitchel to fall from his plane due <b>to</b> an <b>unfastened</b> seatbelt. Mitchel plummeted 500 feet to his death, his body landing in a marsh about a half mile south of the field.|$|R
60|$|They had {{contrived}} {{an apparatus}} with straps and {{a sort of}} little pocket, in which the muzzle of the gun went, so that it hung from the saddle {{down in front of}} their leg; the stock of the gun being secured by a strap against the pommel of the saddle, at the other side of which was their revolver holster. This was an inconvenient way of carrying the gun in some respects, as the strap had <b>to</b> be <b>unfastened</b> <b>to</b> get at it, and the chance of a shot thereby lost; but they considered it preferable to the mode they had at first adopted, of riding with their guns slung behind them. This they gave up, because, with the utmost care, they occasionally got a fall, when galloping, from the armadillo holes, and the shock was greatly increased from the weight of the gun, besides the risk, to any one riding near, of the gun exploding. When riding quietly, and upon the lookout for game, they carried the gun in readiness upon their arms.|$|R
60|$|Few {{words were}} spoken among the prisoners. Their arms were free, but their legs firmly secured with ropes; and ten armed Aztecs kept watch over them, {{to see that}} they made no attempt <b>to</b> <b>unfasten</b> their bonds.|$|E

60|$|In {{one corner}} of the room was a door. On trying it, he found it <b>to</b> be <b>unfastened</b> and, opening it, he walked out. There was a flight of narrow stone steps, in what was evidently a {{projecting}} turret. Ascending these, he found himself on a flat roof, {{on the top of the}} tower. He spent half an hour here, examining carefully the features of the ground and the defences of the fort. The place, though strong, did not approach, in this respect, many of the hill forts that he had seen in the Deccan; and he concluded that a British force of moderate strength could easily effect its capture though, if stoutly held, it could defy native attack.|$|R
60|$|Montague {{contemplated}} Felixstowe's somewhat weedy but not unathletic form, {{exceeded the}} time and fell with {{his head in the}} water. His assailant took the key from his pocket as he staggered <b>to</b> his feet, <b>unfastened</b> the rope and paddled across the channel. A moment later there were hasty steps upon the stone stairs and the door with its iron grating was unlocked. Jacob advanced to meet his friend.|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} had been in a terrible rage and had bitten at the wires until he had made his mouth sore. When he had made sure that the wires were stouter than his teeth, he wisely stopped trying to get out in that way, and made up his mind that the only thing to do was to watch for a chance to slip out, if the door of the cage should happen <b>to</b> be left <b>unfastened.</b>|$|R

50|$|The companions {{begin to}} {{implement}} the plan. Kramer on accident as he thinks meets with a charming Natalia whom he helps to start the stalled car.

Natalia asks Kramer <b>to</b> help her <b>unfasten</b> the necklace and insensibly throws the adornment into the window where it is picked by Moks.|$|R
30|$|This type of crash is {{the most}} {{widespread}} crash at the vicinity of intersections. As it was previously mentioned, the probability {{of other types of}} crashes occurring at junctions or intersections has reduced, whereas it has increased for this type of crash. The very simple form of the utility function is because of where this type of crash happens; many variables have a very limited interval of changes and are negligibly useful to explain the crash. The positive sign of a coefficient related <b>to</b> the <b>unfastening</b> seatbelt variable shows that drivers who do not fasten the seatbelts have been more probable to experience an angular crash. These drivers are negligent about the laws and pay less attention to signs and traffic lights. Therefore, they are more probable to have an angular crash, which seems thoroughly plausible. Adverse weather condition also increases the probability of this type of crash, while it shows a decrease on weekends. It is because during weekends, the passages are less crowded.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless this calm {{security}} was presently invaded {{by a sense}} of stealthy life and motion. What had seemed a fixed shadow suddenly detached itself from the deck, and began to slip stanchion by stanchion along the bulwarks toward the companion way. At the cabin door it halted and crouched motionless. Then rising, it glided forward with the same staccato movement until opposite the slight elevation of the forehatch. Suddenly it darted <b>to</b> the hatch, <b>unfastened</b> and lifted it with a swift, familiar dexterity, and disappeared in the opening. But as the moon shone upon its vanishing face, it revealed the whitening eyes and teeth of the Lascar seaman.|$|R
