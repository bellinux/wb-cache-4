5000|$|In {{solar thermal}} water heating applications, an {{individual}} absorber tube of an evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collector</b> {{is up to}} 40% more efficient compared to more traditional [...] "flat plate" [...] solar water collectors. This {{is largely due to}} the vacuum that exists within the tube, which slows down convective and conductive heat loss. Relative efficiencies of the evacuated tube system are reduced however, when compared to flat plate collectors because the latter have a larger aperture size and can absorb more solar energy per unit area. This means that while an individual evacuated tube has better insulation (lower conductive and convective losses) due to the vacuum created inside the tube, an array of tubes found in a completed solar assembly absorbs less energy per unit area due to there being less absorber surface area pointed toward the sun because of the rounded design of an evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collector.</b> Therefore, real world efficiencies of both designs are about the same.|$|E

The evacuated description refers to the vacuum created in the glass tubes during the manufacturing process, which results in very low heat loss and lets evacuated tube systems achieve extreme temperatures, far in excess of water's boiling point.|$|E

50|$|Flat-plate {{collectors}} usually {{lose more}} heat {{to the environment}} than evacuated tubes, as an increasing function of temperature. They are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production. Evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio (typically 60-80% of gross area) compared to flat plates. Based on absorber plate area, most evacuated tube systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems. This makes them suitable where roof space is limiting, for example where the number of occupants of a building {{is higher than the}} number of square metres of suitable and available roof space. In general, per installed square metre, evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low (e.g. during winter) or when the sky is overcast. However even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat, some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors.</b> Although several European companies manufacture evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors,</b> the evacuated <b>tube</b> market is dominated by manufacturers in the East. Several Chinese companies have track records of 15-30 years. There is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability. However, evacuated tube technology is younger and (especially for newer variants with sealed heat pipes) still need to demonstrate competitive lifetimes. The modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance, for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes.|$|R
50|$|A longstanding {{argument}} {{exists between}} proponents {{of these two}} technologies. Some {{of this can be}} related to the physical structure of evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> which have a discontinuous absorbance area. An array of evacuated tubes on a roof has open space between the <b>collector</b> <b>tubes,</b> and vacuum between the two concentric glass <b>tubes</b> of each <b>collector.</b> <b>Collector</b> <b>tubes</b> cover only a fraction of a unit area of a roof. If evacuated tubes are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of area of roof occupied, a different conclusion might be reached than if the areas of absorber were compared. In addition, the ISO 9806 standard is ambiguous in describing {{the way in which the}} efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured, since these could be measured either in terms of gross area or in terms of absorber area. Unfortunately, power output is not given for thermal collectors as it is for PV panels. This makes it difficult for purchasers and engineers to make informed decisions.|$|R
50|$|The {{figures are}} fairly similar between the above collectors, {{yielding}} some 4 kWh/day in a temperate climate and some 8 kWh/day in a tropical climate when using a collector with a 2 m2 absorber. In the temperate scenario this {{is sufficient to}} heat 200 litres of water by some 17 Â°C. In the tropical scenario the equivalent heating would be by some 33 Â°C. Many thermosiphon systems have comparable energy output to equivalent active systems. The efficiency of evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> is somewhat lower than for flat plate collectors because the absorbers are narrower than the tubes and the tubes have space between them, resulting in a significantly larger percentage of inactive overall collector area. Some methods of comparison calculate the efficiency of evacuated <b>tube</b> <b>collectors</b> based on the actual absorber area {{and not on the}} 'space occupied as has been done in the above table. Efficiency is reduced at higher temperatures.|$|R
