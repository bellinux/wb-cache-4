Based on self-determination theory, two types of rationales, intrinsic goal framing and extrinsic goal framing, were examined to know which message type is effective. Also, individual’s level of issue involvement was tested as a moderating variable. To investigate the effects of goal framing on motivation and moderating effects of involvement, this study designed a 2 x 2 (goal framing x involvement) between subjects with 120 middle school students in Korea. Three procedures involved for the experiment: 1) receiving message for manipulating involvement and goal framing 2) Playing actual serious game, and 3) answering survey questionnaire. Overall, providing intrinsic goal before a serious game was more effective to increase both motivation and performance than presenting extrinsic goal.

40|$|The {{performance}} tradeoff between hardware {{complexity and}} clock speed is studied. First, a generic superscalar pipeline is de-fined. Then the {{specific areas of}} register renaming, instruction win-dow wakeup and selection logic, and operand bypassing are ana-lyzed. Each is modeled and Spice simulated for feature sizes of 0 : 8 m, 0 : 35 m, and 0 : 18 m. Performance results and trends are expressed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> width and window size. Our analysis in-dicates that window wakeup and selection logic as well as operand bypass logic {{are likely to be}} the most critical in the future. A microarchitecture that simplifies wakeup and selection logic is proposed and discussed. This implementation puts chains of de-pendent instructions into queues, and issues instructions from mul-tiple queues in parallel. Simulation shows little slowdown as com-pared with a completely flexible issue window when performance is measured in clock cycles. Furthermore, because only instructions at queue heads need to be awakened and selected, issue logic is simpli-fied and the clock cycle is faster – consequently overall performance is improved. By grouping dependent instructions together, the pro-posed microarchitecture will help minimize performance degrada-tion due to slow bypasses in future wide-issue machines. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{demonstrate}} that the existing legal frameworks for database protection are inadequate – the American framework under-protects databases, while the European framework over-protects. This paper presents an economic analysis of the current scope of legal protections for databases versus the ideal, with an especial emphasis {{on the role of}} intellectual property rights in providing these protections, and concludes with proposals for an ideal system. After an overview of the current systems of legal protections for databases in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), there will be an explanation of how different types of laws (competition, contract, and most importantly, intellectual property rights) impact the production and innovation of databases. The analysis will show that intellectual property rights are the most comprehensive and efficient form of legal protection due to its ability to limit transaction costs, provide adequate incentives for production, and maintain a reasonable barrier to entry. The scope and specificity of legal protections affects both the static and dynamic efficiency of markets, impacting not just the health of market functions, but also the growth and development of innovation. The proper scope of protection and whether intellectual property rights are the optimal source of protection depends on the economic nature of databases. If databases were to be treated as a commodity by the law, it is necessary for the law to accurately reflect the type of good that it is regulating, as different types of goods require different incentive structures. The paper will conclude with recommendations for an ideal legal system for the protection and regulation of databases, starting with accurately defining databases and ending with reasonable terms for copyrights. The solution is to find the balance between the US and the EU systems in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> definition, economic incentives, and legal theory...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} fifty years, calls {{to address the}} ethical and social {{dimensions}} in the biosciences have become pervasive. To this end, notions of bioethics, and an associated range of methodologies have been institutionalised throughout the UK biosciences; talk of research ethics, public engagement, various forms of technology assessment, and recently notions of responsible innovation in technoscientific worlds is increasingly commonplace. A desire to unpack discourse and action surrounding these practices sits {{at the heart of}} this thesis. Of particular interest are the ways that different groups construct the ethical dimensions of biofuel development and deployment and then distribute responsibility for addressing them. To achieve this, I find analytic power by deploying theory from the interpretative social sciences, namely the sociology of bioethics and science and technology studies. Empirically, I use controversy about the development and deployment of biofuels as a means to analyse, primarily through documentary analysis and qualitative interview, how three prominent groups (non-governmental organisations, public research funders and scientists) construct understandings of ethics and then distribute responsibility for addressing those issues. This approach makes it possible to see that the constitution of ethical issues (their ‘form’) and the ways that they are addressed (the ‘task’ of ethics) are both tightly coupled to the situations from which they arise. They are thus fundamentally multiple, locally contingent and often unpredictable. Using a range of discursive strategies and actions, actors are able to negotiate, blurring in and out of focus, what counts as an appropriate issue of concern, who should be addressing it and how. Dominant traditions of theory and practice have a tendency to standardise the form and task of ethics, such as in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> types (e. g. ‘Playing God’) and the methods for addressing them (e. g. public engagement). I argue that situated nature of ethical dimensions should be acknowledged rather than ignored and that doing so is fundamental to making research more ‘socially robust’. However, this tension between dominant institutionalised forms and lived experiences is not easily resolved because it forces an engagement with the roles of those who are tasked with steering knowledge production. Hope is, however, offered by new approaches that have explicitly sought to deal with such tensions in new forms of knowledge production and new models of collaboration...|$|E
