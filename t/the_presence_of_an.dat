30|$|In {{the domain}} {{personnel}} and resources, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> box trainer is considered relatively {{more important than}} <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virtual reality (VR) trainer. This {{finding is consistent with}} recent results of Palter et al., who found in their inventory that residents prefer box trainers above VR simulators for training the more advanced laparoscopic skills [13]. Regarding the assessment of laparoscopic skills, both trainer models have an equally good correlation [14]. VR trainers have the advantage as they allow solitary training while the supervisor can monitor the resident's skills level electronically. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supervisor required during box training has the advantage that surgical knowledge can be transmitted. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laboratory technician is rated low. This could be {{explained by the fact that}} an enthusiastic laparoscopic expert can fulfil this role.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embryo per se {{would be}} equivocal {{regarding}} this issue, {{the conditions in}} which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite the presence of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E

Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas.
