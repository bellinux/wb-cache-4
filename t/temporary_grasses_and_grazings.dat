40|$|LP {{models of}} Norwegian dairy farms are {{designed}} to evaluate the impact of changes in prices and subsidies on production systems and on profitability at the farm level. At 1999 -prices, producing a fixed milk quota with low to moderate yielding cows (6000 to 6600 kg milk annually) is most profitable. Silage offered ad libitum is profitable. A three cut harvesting system is more profitable than two cuts. Changes in the milk price have no effects on production. If forage crops is the only possible land use, increased area payments have no effects on production. If non-forage crops are also grown, increased area payments for forage crops result in {{a higher proportion of}} the land being used for <b>temporary</b> <b>grass</b> (ley) <b>and</b> in cheaper forage, making higher silage intake per cow profitable. Higher intake of silage achieved through supplementing less con-centrates, results in lower milk yield per cow. By increasing headage payments, milk yield falls, as it is optimal to have more cows to produce the same quota output. Reduced product and concentrate prices combined with higher area and headage payments result in more cows and lower yields. Silage offered in a fixed ration is the most profitable option and the level of concentrates per cow is high. More land is then used for permanent pastures and less for non-forage crops...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} natural and {{ecological}} ways of reversibility, setting arable land aside, is estab-lishing a <b>temporary</b> <b>grass</b> stand with a special management and biomass utilisation (Firbank et al. 2003). The influence {{of the way of}} the setting, the land aside on the following crops, its means on their nutrition and weed control requirements, is often researched. Pure stands of legumes are important as good forecrops especially in the agricultural systems with limited inputs, but they have a very low coverage in winter. Grass stands have a be�er coverage but nitrogen fertilisation is necessary when they are des-tined for more years of growing to maintain complete and dense sward. Temporary grass-legume mixtures with different species and components shared can be a good solution (Svobodová et al. 2001). The utilisation of the produced biomass is the other problem. If it is not used for example as a source of energy, it is necessary to leave it on the field surface, best cut up as a mulch, that is for a source of nutrients and organic matter for the soil microflora, microfauna and plants. The influence of mulching on yields and botanical composition of <b>temporary</b> <b>grass</b> monoculture stands was researched on the arable land by Šantrůček et al.
