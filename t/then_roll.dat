5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E

He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds. Brigid Cook was trying to guide a number of people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and walked across to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people {{scrambling}} to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there. A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Miss Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.|$|E
500|$|... "We R Who We R" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop {{song that}} uses a synth-heavy backing; the song {{incorporates}} techno and electropop styles. Opening with a synth-infused backing and sounds interpreted as hand claps, Kesha opens the song by proclaiming, [...] "Hot and dangerous if you're one of us, <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> with us 'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love". Vocally, the song follows {{in the footsteps of}} Kesha's previous singles, as Kesha uses her talk-singing vocal style throughout the song. Kesha uses layered vocals that are enhanced in some parts with the use of Auto-Tune. Musically, the song has been said to follow a musical structure similar to her debut single, [...] "Tik Tok" [...] (2009).|$|E

500|$|In 1932, van Meegeren {{moved to}} the village of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin with his wife. There he rented a {{furnished}} mansion called [...] "Primavera" [...] and set out to define the chemical and technical procedures that would be necessary to create his perfect forgeries. He bought authentic 17th century canvases and mixed his own paints from raw materials (such as lapis lazuli, white lead, indigo, and cinnabar) using old formulas to ensure that they were authentic. In addition, he created his own badger-hair paintbrushes similar to those that Vermeer was known to have used. He came up with a scheme of using phenol formaldehyde (Bakelite) to cause the paints to harden after application, making the paintings appear as if they were 300 years old. After completing a painting, van Meegeren would bake it at [...] to [...] to harden the paint, and <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> it over a cylinder to increase the cracks. Later, he would wash the painting in black India ink to fill in the cracks.|$|E

Kinski wanted to play a [...] "wild, ranting madman", but Herzog wanted something [...] "quieter, more menacing".

After waiting for the hot-tempered actor's inevitable tantrum to [...] "burn itself out", Herzog would <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> the camera.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "putt" [...] {{is used in}} short-distance {{shots on}} or near the green, {{typically}} made with the eponymous [...] "putter", although similar strokes can be made with medium to high-numbered irons to carry a short distance in the air and <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> (a [...] "bump and run"). The backswing and follow-through of the putt are both abbreviated compared to other strokes, {{with the head of the}} club rarely rising above the knee. The goal of the putt is usually to put the ball in the hole, although a long-distance putt may be called a [...] "lag" [...] and is made with the primary intention of simply closing distance to the hole or otherwise placing the ball advantageously.|$|E
2500|$|Those farmers, {{that did}} not go out of {{business}} again, consolidated their holdings from other farmers who could not keep their lands as they had no [...] "employees" [...] to farm their fields. The answer to the labor problem came from the cigarette. The quality of the tobacco, although still considered, {{did not have to be}} perfect as it would be minced to be wrapped into paper. The next step to limiting labor was the process of creating the cigarette. During the 1870s a machine was invented by Albert Pease of Dayton, Ohio, which chopped up the tobacco for cigarettes. Up until the 1880s, cigarettes were still made by hand and were high in price. In 1881, James Bonsack, an avid craftsman, created a machine that revolutionized cigarette production. The machine chopped the tobacco, then dropped a certain amount of the tobacco into a long tube of paper, which the machine would <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> and push out the end where it would be sliced by the machine into individual cigarettes. This machine operated at thirteen times the speed of a human cigarette roller.|$|E

2500|$|A hole is {{classified}} by its par, meaning {{the number of}} strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole. The minimum par of any hole is 3 because par always includes a stroke for the tee shot and two putts. [...] Pars of 4 and 5 strokes are ubiquitous on golf courses; more rarely, a few courses feature par-6 and even par-7 holes. Strokes other than the tee shot and putts {{are expected to be}} made from the fairway; for example, a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par-4 hole in two strokes—one from the tee (the [...] "drive") and another, second, stroke to the green (the [...] "approach")—and <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> the ball into the hole in two putts for par. Putting the ball on the green with two strokes remaining for putts is called making [...] "green in regulation" [...] or GIR. Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par, but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available; conversely, making a GIR does not guarantee a par, as the player might require three or more putts to [...] "hole out". Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Late that night, the French Corps commanders reunited at the Emperor's {{headquarters}} at Raasdorf; only Bernadotte was absent, {{as he was}} still struggling to rally his routed infantry at Aderklaa. Napoleon {{knew that he had}} sustained high losses during the evening attacks and that he had failed in his attempt at a quick breakthrough. As many as 11,000 French and Allies were out of action, including Paul Grenier, commander of VI Corps, who had suffered a shattered hand and was out of action for the next day. Despite these setbacks, the Emperor had managed to fix the enemy forces and was now certain that Archduke Charles was ready to give battle on his current positions. For the second day of battle, Napoleon planned a main attack against the enemy left, which was to be conducted by the powerful III Corps under Maréchal Davout, who was ordered to attack the enemy on the plateau behind the Russbach stream, storm the strategic village of Markgrafneusiedl and <b>then</b> <b>roll</b> up the enemy flank. Such an action, if successful, would have compromised the position of the other Austrian Korps on the Wagram plateau and would have forced them back northwestwards, away from any reinforcements they might have expected to receive from Pressburg. Napoleon also planned for his II and IX Corps, as well as the [...] "Army of Italy" [...] to launch secondary attacks, in order to prevent the Austrians from sending reinforcements to their left. In order to shorten and reinforce his battle line, the Emperor also ordered that most of the IV Corps move closer to Aderklaa, with this Corps set to take its new positions towards 02:00 that night. This meant that only Boudet's division was left at Aspern, with orders to defend the lines of communication lines with the military base on Lobau island. The Imperial Guard, Cavalry Reserve and the reinforcements that Napoleon was expecting were to form the battle reserve of the army.|$|E
