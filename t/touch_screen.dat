5|$|Over the Hedge is {{presented}} in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not often seen in a Nintendo DS game. The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas the <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> shows an overhead perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies {{and can be used}} as a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of 2014, the {{phenomenon}} of indie games produced several variations of the genre. The game Jungle Rumble uses a mechanic where players drum on a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> to control the game. Different rhythms correspond with different verbs to control entities in an RTS like environment. The game Crypt of the NecroDancer uses a mechanic where the player controls the main character {{in sync with the}} soundtrack's beat.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{accessing}} messages on devices: directly, indirectly, and with specialized access devices. Direct access methods involve physical {{contact with the}} system, by using a keyboard or a <b>touch</b> <b>screen.</b> Users accessing SGDs indirectly and through specialized devices must manipulate an object in order to access the system, such as maneuvering a joystick, head mouse, optical head pointer, light pointer, infrared pointer, or switch access scanner.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the <b>touch</b> <b>screen,</b> which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>touch</b> <b>screens</b> are {{increasingly}} ubiquitous {{because of their}} versatility and flexibility, they still suffer from some problems that negatively affect their suitability for certain situations. Most notably, <b>touch</b> <b>screens</b> are difficult to operate blindly, without looking at the screen. If we can understand what aspects of <b>touch</b> <b>screens</b> are responsible for which problems, and subsequently find solutions to mitigate those problems, the application area of <b>touch</b> <b>screens</b> can be greatly improved. In this study, {{we look at the}} problems of inattentive operation of peripheral touch controls and their solutions, before trying out a novel solution based on adding richer tactile feedback to the touch interface. In an experimental evaluation, a prototype with this feedback resulted in significantly less visual distraction compared to an interface without tactile feedback and was generally preferred by most users. “Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty gir...|$|R

The Wii U features a controller with an embedded <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> and output 1080p high-definition graphics; it is fully backward-compatible with Wii games and peripherals for the Wii. The Wii remote, Nunchuk controller and balance board are compatible with Wii U games which include support for them. The Wii U was released on November 18, 2012 in North America, November 30, 2012 in Europe and Australia, and December 8, 2012 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Presented in {{traditional}} 2-D animation sprites, the game {{consists of three}} modes to help navigate, {{the map of the}} Dragon World, the area maps, and the battle mode. The world map will be available from the start, and will allow players easy access to each of the areas throughout the game. On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields, forests, caves, and towns on the top screen. The <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> will display available equipment that can be used while in fields. These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno-Caps which can be bought, given, or found in various spots and or treasure chests. Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts. However, some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts. The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss, their stats and the command select icon presented via the <b>touch</b> <b>screen.</b> The game makes little to no use of the stylus, forcing players to rely on the control pad.|$|E

On the head rest of each seat there are two speakers that play music during the ride. The speakers have been designed so that only the rider's selected music track will be audible. On the restraint is a small <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> where riders can choose which song they want to listen to during the ride. Additionally, the trains are equipped with multi-coloured lights that can be seen during the night.|$|E
5|$|Virgin America offers dual-class {{service on}} all flights it operates. Both cabins feature mood {{lighting}} and all seats {{are equipped with}} Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities. The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> service.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the <b>touch</b> <b>screen,</b> 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E

It uses TriOviz for Games Technology, which is integrated with Unreal Engine 3. The Wii U version uses the Wii U's <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> controller {{to let the}} player manage Batman's equipment and upgrades, selectively detonate Explosive Gel placements, and view {{a map of the}} city. The Wii U version adds a Sonar mode which highlights points of interest nearby, and the Battle Armored Tech Mode (BAT Mode) that allows Batman to accrue energy during combat and, when activated, inflict increased damage.|$|E

Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS <b>touch</b> <b>screen,</b> selected by tapping on them and sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units and enemies are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E

5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter is {{a puzzle}} game {{presented}} {{in the style of}} an adventure game. The player controls the actions of a group of three protagonists as they move about a village called Misthallery: Professor Hershel Layton, his assistant Emmy Altava, and a young boy named Luke Triton. While in the village, the three of them are presented with several mysteries that are solved as the plot progresses. Misthallery is divided into several sections, although many require the plot to progress to a certain point before they can be accessed. In order to move about Misthallery, players tap a shoe-shaped icon on the bottom-right corner of the <b>touch</b> <b>screen,</b> and then the arrow representing the direction of the path they wish to take. While in Misthallery, the player is capable of tapping anywhere on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS system to investigate objects and reveal bits of dialogue, hint coins, collectible items, or hidden puzzles. Likewise, if a non-player character is visible on the screen, they can be tapped to initiate a conversation.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but with a touch enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a touch enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E
