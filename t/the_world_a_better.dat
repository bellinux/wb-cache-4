When she leaves {{at the end of}} season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{he decided that}} instead of [...] "having a steady job" [...] – such as his {{position}} at Ames Research Center – he would focus on making <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> place. He reasoned that because {{the complexity of the}} world's problems was increasing, and that any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, {{the most effective way to}} solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence. He believed that the computer, which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems. He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world’s increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed [...] "bootstrapping". His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time [...] "improving their tools for improving their tools" [...] it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress.|$|E

500|$|... "Bad" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} duet between Jackson and musician Prince. Other artists {{that were supposed to}} be featured on the album included Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, but none of those collaborations ended up happening. The song was viewed as a revived [...] "Hit the Road, Jack" [...] progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'. [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem". [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] was seen as Jackson going [...] "a step further" [...] and offering [...] "a straightforward homily of personal commitment", which {{can be seen in the}} lyrics, [...] "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change."

500|$|Catherine Halaby of the Yale Daily News {{said that}} {{songs on the}} album like [...] "Heaven Can Wait", [...] "Butterflies", and [...] "You Are My Life" [...] "fulfill the quota for sugary ballads". Jon Pareles, writing for The New York Times, said that tracks on Invincible like [...] "Butterflies"' and [...] "Don't Walk Away" [...] are [...] "melting love ballads". Pareles noted in his review for the album that songs on it are {{recurring}} themes present on Jackson's albums, such as love ballads, as well as tracks pertaining to making <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> place. Tim Perzyk of the Duke Chronicle wrote, [...] "By the time 'Butterflies' spins on track seven, it's unclear why Michael didn't record a collaborative boxed set with Mariah Carey, whose 'Heartbreaker,' 'Breakdown' and 'Butterfly' would fit quite nicely" [...] into Jackson's Invincible album. Pop music critic Craid Seymour of the Buffalo News wrote that [...] "another winning tune" [...] on the album is the [...] "dreamy 'Butterflies,' which flows along at a groovy midtempo pace." [...] Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch described [...] "Butterflies" [...] as being about the [...] "feeling that special someone gives him." [...] Music critics writing for the South Florida Sun Sentinel said that the track shows the [...] "shy, loving, gentle side" [...] of Jackson.|$|E

[...] "Heartbeat" [...] was replaced by [...] "Holiday" [...] and incorporated elements of her then latest single [...] "Celebration", and her first single [...] "Everybody". After Michael Jackson's death, it was modified to include a medley of three Michael Jackson songs, as an homage to the recently deceased singer. The performance featured Madonna's dancer Kento, who danced in similar clothing and dancing style as Jackson. Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up" [...] replaced the rock version of [...] "Borderline". It featured elements of rock songs like [...] "My Sharona" [...] by The Knack and [...] "God Save The Queen" [...] by Sex Pistols. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed and replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen" [...] with interpolations from [...] "Open Your Heart", which was set between [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrop for [...] "Frozen" [...] used video outtakes from the song's music video, directed by Chris Cunningham. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was also slightly edited for selected performances with the lyrics from Michael Jackson's song [...] "Man in the Mirror, [...] "If you wanna make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> place... Take a look at yourself, and then make a change" [...] appearing on the screens before the beginning of the song.|$|E
