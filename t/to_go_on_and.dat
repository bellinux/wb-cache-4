5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E

25|$|The {{appointment}} of new Queen's Counsel was suspended in 2003, {{and it was}} widely expected that the system would be abolished. However, a vigorous campaign was mounted in defence of the system.

The school's 1st teams in both hockey and rugby have, in recent years, been a strong selling point for the school, which thrives on their successes.

In retaliaton, Di Cristina {{was killed in}} May 1978 by the Corleonesi. Next was Giuseppe Calderone, who was killed on September 8, 1978. His rival Nitto Santapaola – who had forged an alliance with the Corleonesi – took over the command of the Catania Mafia Family. These skirmishes were just a prelude to the Second Mafia War that really started after the murder of Stefano Bontade in 1981.|$|E
25|$|In the Pyrénées, French Jean Alavoine was the {{dominant}} cyclist, as he won three stages. In the sixth stage, Robert Jacquinot, who was primarily {{known as a}} sprinter, rode away and topped the first three mountains first. He seemed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> win the stage and took over the lead, but the last mountain {{was too much for}} Jacquinot, and he fell off his bike climbing the Peyresourde. Alavoine passed Jacquinot and {{went on to win the}} stage, while Bottecchia won back enough time to regain his lead from Bellenger, who lost a lot of time. When Alavoine won his third stage in Nice, Bottecchia was leading the race, with Alavoine in second place and Henri Pélissier in third place, almost half an hour behind.|$|E
25|$|Hip hop first {{emerged in}} the Bronx in the early 1970s at {{neighborhood}} block parties when DJs, like DJ Kool Herc, began isolating percussion breaks in funk and R songs and rapping while the audience danced. For many years, New York was the only city with a major hip-hop scene, {{and all of the}} early recordings came from New York. People like Kurtis Blow and LL Cool J brought hip hop to the mainstream for the first time, while so-called East Coast rap was defined in the 1980s by artists including Eric B. & Rakim, Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C.. Major New York stars emerged <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> produce multi-platinum records, including Puff Daddy, Jay-Z and The Notorious B.I.G., along with critically acclaimed acts like Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, Big L, and Busta Rhymes.|$|E

25|$|John Richardson, naturalist, {{explorer}} {{and naval}} surgeon {{was born in}} Dumfries as was John Craig, mathematician, and polymath James Crichton. Benjamin Bell after being born in Dumfries {{went on to become}} considered the first Scottish scientific surgeon.

Doyle's father, artist Charles Altamont Doyle, died in Dumfries. Thomas Peter Anderson Stuart left Dumfries <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> found the University of Sydney Medical School. John Allan Broun's contribution to science were his discoveries around magnetism and meteorology. James Braid, surgeon and pioneer of hypnotism and hypnotherapy, practised in Dumfries from 1825 to 1828 in partnership with William Maxwell. Ian Callum is eminent in the world of motor engineer.|$|E
25|$|Dailly was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> score twice from 43 {{games as}} West Ham {{finished}} in the Division One play-off positions in 2003–04. He scored the winner against Ipswich Town in the play-off semi-final {{to send them to}} the final but they failed to win promotion. Injury prevented Dailly from the majority of West Ham's promotion-winning 2004–05 season, although he returned to make brief appearances in one play-off semi-final leg and the final. He signed a new deal with West Ham in June 2005. Dailly appeared as a substitute for West Ham in their 2006 FA Cup Final defeat to Liverpool, coming on in the 77th minute. Despite being 2–0 ahead after 28 minutes, West Ham eventually lost on penalties. He was the longest serving West Ham player {{at the time of his}} departure and something of a cult hero to the fans.|$|E

I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} with the Israelites in slavery in Egypt. Moses leads them out of Egypt and through the {{wilderness}} to Mount Sinai, where Yahweh reveals himself and offers them a Covenant: they are to keep his torah (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will be their god {{and give them the}} land of Canaan. The Book of Leviticus records the laws of God. The Book of Numbers tells how the Israelites, led now by their god Yahweh, journey on from Sinai towards Canaan, but when their spies report that the land is filled with giants they refuse <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> Yahweh condemns them to remain in the desert until the generation that left Egypt passes away. After thirty-eight years at the oasis of Kadesh Barnea the next generation travel on to the borders of Canaan, where Moses addresses them for the final time and gives them further laws. The Exodus ends with the death of Moses on Mount Nebo and his burial by God, while the Israelites prepare for the conquest of the land.|$|E
25|$|She was not {{immediately}} commissioned for service, but went on to serve during the American War of Independence {{in a number of}} theatres. She was initially in the Caribbean, where she fought at the Battle of Grenada, before returning to Britain to join a special expedition under Commodore George Johnstone, to capture the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. The expedition was surprised by a French fleet at the Battle of Porto Praya and though Johnstone was able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> capture several Dutch merchants in the Battle of Saldanha Bay, he did not attempt to attack the Cape. Monmouth, under her Captain James Alms, was sent on with several other warships to reinforce the East Indies station, and she went on to fight in a number of actions under Sir Edward Hughes against French fleets under the Bailli de Suffren. She returned to Britain on the conclusion of the wars and saw no further active service. Renamed Captivity and used as a prison ship from 1796, she served out the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was broken up in 1818.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 2009, Halladay {{made his}} team-record seventh {{straight}} Opening Day start for Toronto, defeating the Detroit Tigers. Halladay then also won his next two starts, {{on the road}} against the Cleveland Indians and the Minnesota Twins. Halladay lost his next game to the Rangers giving up 5 earned runs over 8 innings only <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> win his next 6 games to bring his record up to 8–1 with a 2.75 ERA. With season-ending injuries to planned 2009 Jays' starters Dustin McGowan and Shawn Marcum, and with #2 starter Jesse Litsch {{on the disabled list}} early in the season, Halladay led a staff of young, mostly inexperienced starters. Halladay was named the AL Player of the Week for the period ending May 17. Doc was 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA over 16.0 innings in his two starts the week prior. In a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on June 2, Halladay struck out 14 batters and threw 133 pitches, both career highs. On June 12, he left the game early because of a strained hip adductor muscle, commonly referred to as a pulled groin, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 17. On July 5, he was selected to represent Toronto at the All-Star Game. On July 14, he started the All-Star Game for the American League, pitching 2 innings and giving up 3 runs, of which 1 was unearned. That year, he was named #7 on the Sporting Newss list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.|$|E

After Amundsen outlined his new proposals, each man was asked whether he was willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> all responded positively. Amundsen wrote a lengthy letter of explanation to Nansen, stressing how the North Pole claims of Cook and Peary had dealt a [...] "death blow" [...] to his original plans.

[...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single.
