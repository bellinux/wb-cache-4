5|$|The film's final sequence, which {{features}} Superman flying {{high above the}} Earth at sunrise, and breaking the fourth wall <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> briefly at the camera, featured {{at the end of}} every Superman film starring Reeve and was re-shot with Brandon Routh for Superman Returns.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{citizens}} of Oz, spurred on by Madame Morrible and Boq's testimony, band together to help rescue Dorothy from the clutches of the Wicked Witch of the West. Glinda has realized Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death, but when she confronts her, Morrible tells her that there is blood on her hands as well and advises her <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> and wave. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba as the angry mob sets out to Kiamo Ko to kill Elphaba. ("March of the Witch Hunters").|$|E
5|$|Homer goes to {{the arcade}} and enlists {{the help of a}} local video gamer, while Marge takes Lisa to band practice. She tells Lisa <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> no matter how she feels inside, to {{suppress}} her emotions in order to be popular, and that happiness will follow. But when she sees Lisa hiding her true feelings and being taken advantage of by her classmates, Marge changes her tune and tells Lisa to be herself and her support helps Lisa to feel genuinely happy. When Homer returns home, he is about to defeat Bart in a rematch but Marge unplugs the game console to announce Lisa's recovery, while Bart declares his retirement as undefeated video boxing champ. Later, the Simpsons visit a jazz club to hear Bleeding Gums Murphy sing a blues number written by Lisa.|$|E

25|$|Gwynn {{had three}} {{procedures}} to remove noncancerous growths from his parotid gland since 1997. In 2010, {{he was diagnosed}} with cancer of a salivary gland and had lymph nodes and tumors from the gland removed. The operation left his face partially paralyzed on the right side, leaving him unable <b>to</b> <b>smile.</b> Later that year, he underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. He was declared cancer free afterwards, and also regained his ability <b>to</b> <b>smile.</b> Additional surgery was performed in 2012 to remove more cancerous growth and address nerve damage. Gwynn attributed the cancer to the dipping tobacco habit that he had since playing rookie ball in Walla Walla in 1981. Doctors, however, stated that studies had not linked parotid cancer with use of chewing tobacco.|$|E
25|$|Hammond's ill-equipped army {{returned}} to England beaten, yet deserving {{of the highest}} honours for their sportsmanship, their ability <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> {{in the face of}} certain disaster and also for their success in gaining the objective of their invasion - the spreading of cricket goodwill from the Homeland to a Dominion.|$|E

25|$|Dolores, {{like the}} other former mannequins, was only {{required}} to walk and pose when on stage. It was said that she never smiled during an appearance. In 1920, however, she had her first speaking part in the musical comedy Sally, where she played the minor role of Mrs Ten Broek. It is not recorded whether she was required <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> during the performance.|$|E
25|$|Southdown Gliding Club in Storrington {{provided}} the venue for the complex glider {{scene in the}} film where the audience first meets JASP airline Captain Jeremy Adamson (Christopher Dickins) and his daughter Molly, played by 16-year-old Romina Hytten. Despite never having been in a glider before, Romina managed <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> her way through 22 consecutive loops and countless rolls with experienced pilot Guy Westgate.|$|E
25|$|Tired of {{the feast}} and its guests, Salome flees to the terrace. When she hears Jochanaan cursing her mother (Herodias), Salome's curiosity is piqued. The palace guards will not honor her petulant orders to fetch Jochanaan for her, so she teasingly works on Narraboth to bring Jochanaan before her. Despite the orders he has {{received}} from Herod, Narraboth finally gives in after she promises <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> at him.|$|E

25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are much less likely <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to}} be communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E
25|$|It {{was soon}} noticed by the troops that the Charleston {{expected}} a fight, since the cruiser began firing subcaliber ammunition at boxes tossed from the City of Peking. This mild training continued until {{the afternoon of}} June 15, when the American cruiser started circling and firing service charges at pyramidal cloth targets set adrift from the cruiser herself. The range was about , and the gun crews, which were composed largely of the green recruits {{under the command of}} Second Lieutenant John Twiggs Myers, were shooting accurately enough to cause Captain Glass <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> pleasantly. By the time the convoy crossed the 180th meridian, the officers and men felt they were ready for the enemy.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, it is {{generally}} {{believed to have been}} influenced by Beheiren's anti-Vietnam War activists in the late 1960s and Konica's advertisement in 1971. A more colorful account of this practice claims it was influenced by the American figure skater Janet Lynn during the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Hokkaidō. She fell during a free-skate period, but continued <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> even as she sat on the ice. Though she placed third in the competition, her cheerful diligence and persistence resonated with many Japanese viewers. Lynn became an overnight foreign celebrity in Japan. A peace activist, Lynn frequently flashed the V sign when she was covered in Japanese media, and she is credited by some Japanese for having popularized its use since the 1970s in amateur photographs.|$|E

25|$|He then {{played all}} three Tests in New Zealand, {{but apart from}} a {{marathon}} bowling performance in the first innings at Wellington where he and Phil Tufnell shared 140 overs almost equally (Hick's 69–27–126–4 was to be his best in Tests), he again had little <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> about. Considerably more enjoyable for him was the 1992 World Cup which immediately followed: England reached the final, thanks {{in no small part}} to Hick's three half-centuries. The most important of these came in the semi-final against South Africa at the SCG. Although this game is now more often remembered for the rain-related fiasco which left South Africa needing an impossible 22 runs from one ball, it was Hick's Man-of-the-Match-winning knock of 83 (in an innings where the second top score was 33) which made England's victory possible in the first place. He could not replicate it in the final, being lbw to Mushtaq Ahmed for 17.|$|E
25|$|This {{album is}} filled with {{feelings}} of lethargy, languor and disengagement, yet most of the tracks sound warm and sweet, {{as opposed to those}} piquant self-centered ones before her motherhood. Reporters noticed that she began <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> more often in public and was not as icy or aloof as before. However, the album was released during the Asian financial crisis which swept East and Southeast Asia. Wong's old company Cinepoly, which retains the copyright on her previous records, released a Mandarin compilation {{at the same time in}} 1997 to counteract her new EMI album (and indeed outperformed it). Later, Cinepoly would release two compilations each year to compete with Faye's new releases, a tactic which has come under fire from her international fans. Faye Wong did not sell well in Hong Kong, but did quite well in Taiwan and mainland China. Although Wong had garnered some popularity with her 4 previous Mandarin albums, it was really this sweet yet slightly alternative album which had the Mainland Chinese audience listening. Her profile began to rise sharply in Asia.|$|E
25|$|The two of {{them are}} taken {{to the edge of the}} Discworld by the ocean {{currents}} and nearly carried over, but they are caught by the Circumfence, a huge net built by the nation of Krull to catch sea life and flotsam washed in from the rest of the Discworld. They are rescued by Tethis the sea troll, a being composed of water who had fallen off the edge of his own world and onto the Discworld, where he was subsequently enslaved by the Krullians. Rincewind and Twoflower are then taken by the Krullians to their capital, where they learn that the Krullians intend to discover the sex of Great A'Tuin by launching a space capsule over the edge of the Disc, and plan to sacrifice Rincewind and Twoflower to get the god Fate <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> on the voyage, Fate insisting on their sacrifice after they caused him to lose the earlier game. Rincewind and Twoflower attempt to escape, but end up stealing the capsule, which is launched with Twoflower inside, the tourist wishing to see the other worlds of the universe. Rincewind is unable to get into the capsule in time, and falls off the Disc alongside it, the Luggage following them soon after.|$|E

500|$|A {{second round}} of Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} were also taking place on January 21, and by then, Baird was politically isolated, with no major groups coming to her defense. [...] A growing number of senators came out in opposition to Baird during the day, including two Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and influential centrist Democrats John Breaux of Louisiana and David Boren of Oklahoma. [...] Baird gamely continued <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> and testify well into the evening, but as Stephanopoulos later wrote, [...] "She didn't know it yet, but she was toast." [...] Biden called Clinton and told him the nomination was lost.|$|E
500|$|In {{recognition}} of the team's achievement, Wenger was awarded the Barclaycard Manager of the Year, {{in addition to being}} named the League Managers Association Manager of the Year. Ljungberg, who scored in five of Arsenal's last eight league matches, as well as the second goal in the cup final, was given the Barclaycard Player of the Year accolade. Pirès was named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, with five votes separating himself from Ruud van Nistelrooy; he said it was [...] "a great honour" [...] to receive the award, adding: [...] "Times have been difficult with my injury, but this has given me something <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> about." ...|$|E

Partner also sired Tartar, the sire of Herod. Matchem's dam was also full-sister to Miss Partner.|$|R
60|$|SHORTLY after breakfast, {{at which}} he {{assisted}} with a highly tragical countenance, John sought his father where he sat, presumably in religious meditation, on the Sabbath mornings.
