40|$|The author {{reports on}} six months' {{experience}} of obtaining advance directives from patients for {{care in a}} family practice. Patients were questioned about their preferences for comfort or prolonging life and then were asked to delegate a substitute decision maker. Of 20 patients, all who responded <b>chose</b> <b>comfort</b> over prolonging life. Delegated substitute decision makers included spouses, children, and professionals or friends. In this population, patients overwhelmingly favoured comfort over prolonging life {{in the event that}} they might be irreversibly disabled, and <b>they</b> tended to <b>choose</b> spouses or other first-degree relatives as substitute decision makers...|$|R
5000|$|Reward Challenge: Contestants would {{each place}} {{possessions}} and a <b>chosen</b> <b>comfort</b> item (either a pillow, comforter, or mosquito net) {{on top of}} a box resting on a trapdoor. They would then answer showbiz-style questions based on lie detector tests conducted before their departure from the Philippines. Untrue answers would result in the possessions dropping into a mud pit below the trapdoor, as well as elimination from the challenge. Last man standing would win the reward.|$|R
50|$|Consistent with choice blindness, Henkel and Mather {{found that}} people are easily {{convinced}} by false reminders that <b>they</b> <b>chose</b> different options than <b>they</b> actually <b>chose</b> and that <b>they</b> show greater choice-supportive bias in memory for whichever option <b>they</b> believe <b>they</b> <b>chose.</b>|$|R

30|$|Additionally, we ran the {{simulation}} {{for the whole}} dataset again for the extremes of the examined comfort temperature range, which are marked as red circles in Fig.  8. The average relative savings for all households at comfort temperatures of 18 °C and 25 °C were 8.69 % and 9.94 %, respectively. The values show little deviation from the savings at a comfort temperature of 20 °C (9.24 %, cf. Table  3) which we used for evaluation. Overall, {{we find that the}} relative savings results for the <b>chosen</b> <b>comfort</b> temperature of 20 °C are also valid for other reasonable temperature settings.|$|R
