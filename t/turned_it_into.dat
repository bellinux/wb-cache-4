5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|E

5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E

5|$|An ardent {{supporter}} of the Kuomintang, Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat-Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan, a two-storey villa at Tai Gin Road. He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the Kuomintang in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China. In 1937, Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan to preserve it as a historical site; it was later {{handed over to the}} Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), which renovated it and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a national monument, the Sun Yat Sen Villa (now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall).|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian {{influence in the}} region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready {{money to pay for}} more troops.|$|E

5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Hollamby died {{suddenly}} {{as a result}} of heart disease at Red House on 29 December 1999; he was the third owner to die while in residence. His funeral was held on 21 January 2000 in Eltham, with a secular humanist service conducted by Barbara Smoker. The Friends of Red House took over the public openings at this point. Amid ill health, Doris left Red House and moved into a care home in 2002; she died in April 2003. With the aid of an anonymous benefactor, the house was purchased and gifted to The National Trust in 2003, who <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a visitor's attraction, with tours continuing to be organised by the Friends of Red House.|$|E
5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, the bar was located in the {{basement}} of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, he <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a showplace for vaudeville-style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance permit and closed down.|$|E

It was originally {{planned to be}} a real-time strategy game for the Mac and Windows operating systems, but later changed into a third-person action game. On June 19, 2000, Microsoft acquired Bungie Studios and Halo: Combat Evolved became a launch title for the Xbox video game console. After receiving Xbox development kits, Bungie Studios rewrote the game's engine, heavily altered its presentation, and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a first-person shooter. Though the first Halo was meant to include an online multiplayer mode, it was excluded because Xbox Live was not yet available.|$|E
5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, this network extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng. The next step was the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E
5|$|A devout Buddhist from youth, {{once her}} {{children}} {{had grown up}} Ho decided to serve the Buddhist cause, and to dedicate {{the rest of her}} life to caring for others. In 1958, she became a Buddhist nun at the age of 50. In 1969, aged 61, Ho bought a two-storey detached house in Richards Avenue with her savings, and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the Man Fut Tong Old Peoples' Home for aged sick and single elderly women. Most of the 20 or so residents had neither enough earnings to support themselves nor any relatives to turn to. To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan. She cleaned, cooked, took her charges to the doctors, helped them to collect their social benefits and even sometimes saw to their last rites.|$|E

5|$|Hadleigh Castle is {{a ruined}} {{fortification}} in the English county of Essex, overlooking the Thames Estuary from {{south of the}} town of Hadleigh. Built after 1215 during the reign of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh, the castle was surrounded by parkland and had an important economic and defensive role. The castle was significantly expanded and remodelled by Edward III, who <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a grander property, designed to defend against a potential French attack, as well as to provide the King with a convenient private residence close to London. Built on a geologically unstable hill of London clay, the castle has often been subject to subsidence; this, combined with the sale of its stonework in the 16th century, has led to it now being ruined. The remains are now preserved by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Shamshi-Adad most {{dangerous}} alliance was with Qatna, whose king Ishi-Addu, became Assyria's agent at Yamhad borders and married {{his daughter to}} Yasmah-Adad, {{the son of the}} Assyrian king who was installed by his father as king of Mari. Sumu-Epuh was apparently killed during his fight with Shamshi-Adad and was succeeded by his son Yarim-Lim I, who consolidated his father's kingdom and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the most powerful kingdom in Syria and northern Mesopotamia. Yarim-Lim surrounded Shamshi-Adad by alliances with Hammurabi of Babylon and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna, then in 1777 BC he advanced to the east conquering Tuttul and installing Zimri-Lim as governor of the city. The death of the Assyrian king came a year later. Yarim-Lim then sent his army with Zimri-Lim, to restore his ancestors throne as an ally-vassal to Yamhad, cementing the relationship through a dynastic marriage between the new Mariote king and Shibtu, the daughter of Yarim-Lim.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E
