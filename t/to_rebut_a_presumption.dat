[...] There is certainly an air of a presumption of guilt surrounding her trial - a presumption that she did little to overturn either before or during it. However, Young's point, that the burden of proof was on the Crown, to prove murder, rather than on the Defence <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> of murder, is certainly a valid one.|$|E
40|$|Presumptions have an {{important}} role in antitrust jurisprudence. This article suggests that a careful formulation of the relevant presumptions and associated evidentiary rebuttal burdens can provide the “enquiry meet for the case” across a large array of narrow categories of conduct confronted in antitrust to create a type of “meta” rule of reason. The article begins this project by using decision theory to analyze the types and properties of antitrust presumptions and evidentiary rebuttal burdens and the relationship between them. Depending on the category of conduct and market structure conditions, antitrust presumptions lie along a continuum from conclusive (irrebuttable) anticompetitive, to rebuttable anticompetitive, to competitively neutral, and on to rebuttable procompetitive and conclusive (irrebuttable) procompetitive presumptions. A key source of these presumptions is the likely competitive effects inferred from market conditions. Other sources are policy-based [...] deterrence policy concerns and overarching policies involving the goals and premises of antitrust jurisprudence. Rebuttal evidence can either undermine the facts on which the presumptions are based or can provide other evidence to offset the competitive effects likely implied by the presumption. The evidentiary burden <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> depends on the strength of the presumption and the availability and reliability of further case-specific evidence. These twin determinants can be combined and understood through the lens of Bayesian decision theory to explain how “the quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. ” The stronger the presumption and less reliable the case-specific evidence in signaling whether the conduct is anticompetitive versus procompetitive, the more difficult it will be for the disfavored party to satisfy the evidentiary burden to rebut the presumption. The evidentiary rebuttal burden generally is a burden of production, but also can involve the burden of persuasion, as with the original Philadelphia National Bank structural presumption, or typical procompetitive presumptions. If a presumption is rebutted with sufficient offsetting evidence to avoid an initial judgment, the presumption generally continues to carry some weakened weight in the post-rebuttal phase of the decision process. That is, a thumb remains on the scale. However, if the presumption is undermined, it is discredited and it carries no weight in the post-rebuttal decision process. The article uses this methodology to analyze various antitrust presumptions. It also analyzes the, burden-shifting rule of reason and suggests that the elements should not be rigidly sequenced in the decision process. The article also begins the project of reviewing, revising and refining existing antitrust presumptions with proposed revisions and refinements in a number of areas. The article invites other commentators to join the project by criticizing these proposals and suggesting others. These presumptions then could be applied by appellate courts and relied upon by lower court, litigants and business planners...|$|E

By reading novel the readers get knowledge about the expression of life without experiencing it themselves.

This analysis is conducted <b>to</b> analyze <b>rebutting</b> <b>a</b> child, named Natalie. The investigation is focused on people involving on rebutting Natalie, the way on rebutting Natalie, the reasons on rebutting Natalie, and the solution on rebutting Natalie. This research uses descriptive method because the study is to describe or to give confirmation about <b>rebutting</b> <b>a</b> child in Clare Benedict’s novel ‘A Bitter Inheritance’. Then, in appreciating Clare Benedict’s novel, the thesis writer uses an objective approach. It is based on studying a literary work itself that is only on rebutting Natalie. The population {{of this study is}} the whole events in the novel ‘A Bitter Inheritance’ by Clare Benedict, while the samples of this thesis are paragraphs, dialogues and quotations related <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> <b>a</b> child. The result of this study concluded that Natalie is being rebutted by Sam Redmond (Natalie’s uncle) and Marco Doyle (Natalie’s father) from Gina Rowland (Natalie’s stepmother). Their way of rebutting is different. Sam Redmond’s way is that by challenging Gina to prove that she is a good mother for Natalie, while Marco Doyle’s way is by exposing Gina’s scandals in the past to the media. Then, Sam Redmond and Marco Doyle have many reasons why they want <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> Natalie from Gina and also really want to be Natalie’s guardian. The reasons are because they still have a blood relation with Natalie and also they want to take a revenge to Gina. In solving the problem about rebutting Natalie, the solution given is that Natalie’s guardianship is still in Gina. As stated in David’s legal letter that Gina is Natalie’s official guardian, so that no one can take Natalie away from he...|$|R

Chapter One further deals with the regulation of derivatives in the Czech law (importantly, its tries <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> <b>an</b> opinion that derivatives fall under the regulation of hazardous activities), it focuses on economic function of derivatives (namely hedging and speculation), it explains and justifies the division of derivatives into "classic" and "modern" or "exotic" derivatives, and finally it describes the main types of classic derivatives and its [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In England and Wales, Section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act (2003) criminalizes the act {{of meeting}} a child –someone under 16 —after grooming. The {{question}} to be pursued in this paper is whether grooming –I confine myself to online grooming—is justly criminalized. I shall argue that it is. One line of thought will be indirect. I shall first try <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> <b>a</b> general argument against the criminalization of acts that are preparatory to the commission of serious offences. Grooming is one such act, but there are others, sometimes associated with terrorism. According to me, the general argument misapplies certain considerations about autonomy that are alleged {{to be in force}} in other areas of criminal law. Contrary to that general argument, criminalization of preparatory acts does not, in general, bypass the agency of citizens. Moreover, the criminalization of preparatory acts can disrupt activity that would have led to very serious crime, and with relatively low costs to the perpetrators, costs that reflect the non-occurrence of the more serious crime. There is evidence that grooming is harmful in itself, and so another point against the general argument is its assumption that preparatory offences are often harmless or at least victimless. There are objections to some of the undercover policing techniques that lead to a Section 15 prosecution, but these objections are not all weighty...|$|R
40|$|Demonstrating that a {{developing}} norm {{is not yet}} well established in international law is frequently thought to show that states are not bound by the norm as law. More precisely, showing that a purported international legal norm has only limited support from well-established international legal sources is normally seen as sufficient <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> <b>an</b> obligation {{on the part of}} subjects to comply with the norm in virtue of its legal status. I contend that this view is mistaken. Nascent norms of international law (e. g., crystallizing norms of customary law) can be binding {{in much the same way}} as better-established doctrine. This point becomes perspicuous, I argue, once we get a clear sense of the plausible options for grounding the moral authority of international law generally. This result is interesting in its own right, but it also reveals two other features of the character of state responsibility under international law. First, the distinction between legislation and compliance is less pronounced compared to domestic law. Consequently, the virtues of good governance will frequently be pertinent to determining the content of states’ obligations under international law. Second, normally more powerful and influential agents will be more strongly bound by international law than other subjects. This is an attractive result, addressing a concern that motivates many international lawyers to view international law as absolutely binding. An absolutist view international legal authority is unnecessary for showing that the most powerful and dangerous states are strongly bound by the terms of much existing law...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{decision}} of the Italian Supreme Court seems to put to an end the judicial saga of the Playstation’s “mod chip” in Italy. The Italian Supreme Court has eventually found the producer of mod chip (the equipment capable of circumventing Sony’s technological protection measure) liable under art. 171 -ter, lett. f-bis), Italian Copyright Law, implementing the provision codified at art. 6 (2), of the Information Society Directive. According to the Court, since videogames cannot be classified as mere software, the circumvention at issue had to be assessed in light of such provision encompassing a stronger burden of proof to be met by defendants. However, not much {{attention has been paid}} to the circumstance that the mod chip allowed circumvention of a measure placed on the console rather than the videogame itself. This fact may prove to be a crucial aspect in the analysis because the elusion of technological protection measures placed on software is disciplined by a different provision bearing a lighter burden of proof for defendants <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> <b>an</b> initial finding of liability.
