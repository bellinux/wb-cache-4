5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll. The left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March, news reached Hotham {{that the}} French fleet was at sea {{and heading for}} Corsica. He {{immediately}} set out to intercept them, and Nelson eagerly anticipated his first fleet action. The French were reluctant to engage and the two fleets shadowed each other throughout 12 March. The following day two of the French ships collided, allowing Nelson to engage the much larger 84-gun Ça Ira {{for two and a}} half hours until the arrival of two French ships forced Nelson <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> away, having inflicted heavy casualties and considerable damage. The fleets continued to shadow each other before making contact again, on 14 March, in the Battle of Genoa. Nelson joined the other British ships in attacking the battered Ça Ira, now under tow from Censeur. Heavily damaged, the two French ships were forced to surrender and Nelson took possession of Censeur. Defeated at sea, the French abandoned their plan to invade Corsica and returned to port.|$|E

50|$|At the gurukula, Dharam and Veer become {{competitors}} {{and a sense}} of rivalry turns their relationship bitter. Later, they reconcile and become inseparable. Toward the end of the training, Veer again meets Shera and this time they fall in love. Although Shera changes due <b>to</b> <b>Veer's</b> love, Veer condemns Shera when he learns her true identity and mission to kill Dharam. The cousins return to Aryanagar where Dharam announces that <b>Veer</b> deserves <b>to</b> be king, and Aryavardhan announces Veer's coronation ceremony.

50|$|Vehicles {{with large}} and wide low profile tires {{are more prone}} to the effects as well as {{vehicles}} which have wheels fitted that are larger than the manufacturers recommendation or have reinforced sidewalls. People who are relatively inexperienced with driving with this tendency will feel that they have to make continual course corrections and it is very easy to overcompensate the steering, which could potentially lead <b>to</b> <b>veering</b> off the road especially if the road is a narrow track/country road.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Gil was {{the first}} of several {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Hawaii during the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. Gil originated from a tropical depression that developed near Clipperton Island on July 23. Steadily intensifying, it attained tropical storm status six hours later and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 26. After attaining peak intensity on July 27, Gil encountered cooler sea surface temperatures and began to weaken. Moving west-northwest, the weakening system also accelerated and on July 31, was downgraded to a tropical depression. However, Gil began to re-intensify on August1, becoming a tropical storm again later that day. Initially expected <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> north of Hawaii, it continued west-northwest and began to approach the Hawaiian group on August 3. While passing through the island group, Gil reached its secondary peak intensity. Subsequently, Gil began to weaken once again as it threatened the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. After passing through the islands, Gil was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 5. Several hours later, the storm dissipated. The remnants of the storm moved into the West Pacific late on August 6 and were last noted the next morning while passing south of Midway Island.|$|E
5|$|Severely damaged, Tripoli {{struck her}} colors to {{indicate}} surrender. As Enterprise moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon Enterprise. The Tripolitans again attempted {{to board the}} American schooner, but were repelled by Enterprise broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to Tripoli. In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board Enterprise. Enterprise accurate gunnery once more forced Tripoli <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> off. As the action continued, Rous perfidiously feigned a third surrender {{in an attempt to}} draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept his distance, and ordered Enterprise guns to be lowered to aim at the polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her mizzen-mast, and reducing her to a sinking condition. With most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.|$|E

50|$|The Britten Norman Islander {{took off}} at 10:51 local time, {{carrying}} {{a total of}} 17 passengers, including 2 infants and a 5 month-pregnant woman, and 1 crew member on board. Shortly after takeoff, the airport radio operator noticed that the aircraft disappeared behind the forest. The aircraft contacted the first tree and started <b>to</b> <b>veering</b> <b>to</b> the left. It then hit another tree and began zigzagging. The aircraft then contacted the third tree and started to lose control. The landing gear then struck the last contacted tree and then it crashed upside down onto the forest floor. Both wings were ripped off from the fuselage, with fuels leaking from the right wing tip. This causing a dangerous post-impact fire risk, as soil type in Borneo was often flammable.|$|R

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to launch the GSLVMk.II with an Indian built {{cryogenic}} engine, GSLV-F06 carrying GSAT-5P, failed on 25 December 2010. The initial evaluation implies that loss of control for the strap-on boosters caused the rocket <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> from its intended flight path, forcing a programmed detonation. Sixty-four seconds into {{the first stage of}} flight, the rocket began to break up due to the acute angle of attack. The body housing the 3rd stage, the cryogenic stage, incurred structural damage, forcing the range safety team to initiate a programmed detonation of the rocket.|$|E

Because of this portrayal, communities may be less willing to help the salaryman with his emotional problems, which often leads to clinical depression or even suicide.

25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was completed}} on 27 February 1951 {{and it began}} taxiing trials on 2 March. On the following day it was taxiing at speed up to , but was blown off the runway when a strong crosswind caused the aircraft to bank which compressed the strut on the opposite side. This forced the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> off the runway when the ailerons proved ineffective at countering the bank and the consequent damage forced the testing to be suspended. Some development was done to try to remedy the problems with instability already revealed, but Yakovlev was unenthusiastic about the whole project and it was cancelled in October 1951.|$|E
25|$|Early rockets {{were very}} inaccurate. Without {{the use of}} {{spinning}} or any controlling feedback loop, rockets had a strong tendency <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> sharply off of their intended course. The early Mysorean rockets and their successor British Congreve rockets reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick {{to the end of}} a rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) to make it harder for the rocket to change course. The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.|$|E
