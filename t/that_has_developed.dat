5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> there since the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{configuration}} of root systems serves to structurally support the plant, {{compete with other}} plants and for uptake of nutrients from the soil. Roots grow to specific conditions, which, if changed, can impede a plant's growth.

25|$|Hypercalcaemia, also spelled hypercalcemia, {{is a high}} calcium (Ca2+) {{level in}} the blood serum. The normal range is 2.1–2.6mmol/L (8.8–10.7mg/dL, 4.3–5.2 mEq/L) with levels greater than 2.6mmol/L defined as hypercalcemia. Those with a mild {{increase}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> slowly typically have no symptoms.

According to Geaves Rawat, rather than considering himself a charismatic leader, deemphasizes the sealing of the master disciple relationship, and focuses on correct practice and staying in touch through participation or listening.|$|E

25|$|Another type of the badnjak <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> {{among the}} Serbs has mostly {{replaced}} the traditional log, whose burning is usually unfeasible in modern homes. It is {{a cluster of}} oak twigs with their brown leaves still attached, with which the home is decorated on the Eve. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E
25|$|Arabidopsis FLU mutant with damaged {{regulation}} {{can survive}} only {{either in a}} continuous darkness (protochlorophyllide is not dangerous in the darkness) or under continuous light, when the plant is capable to convert all produced protochlorophyllide into chlorophyll and do not overaccumulate it despite {{of the lack of}} regulation. In barley Tigrina mutant (mutated on the same gene,) light kills the majority of the leaf tissue <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> in the darkness, but part of the leaf that originated during the day survives. As a result, the leaves are covered by white stripes of necrotic regions, and the number of the white stripes is close to the age of the leaf in days. Green regions survive the subsequent nights, likely because the synthesis of chlorophyll in the mature leaf tissue is greatly reduced anyway.|$|E

25|$|Finally, after Deleuze, René Girard {{included}} {{his account}} of sado-masochism in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World, originally Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde, 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire. In this view of sado-masochism, {{the violence of the}} practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding {{of the value of the}} love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.|$|E
25|$|Rylstone is {{becoming}} a popular destination for travellers on a new tourist route <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> following the final sealing of the Bylong Valley Way.

Business associations and local governments in the area are promoting the journey to develop the tourist potential. With the completion of the work Rylstone has seen a steady increase in tourists visiting its cafes, pubs, and bed and breakfast establishments. A route is now available from Sydney through the Hunter Region and return to Sydney via Rylstone providing a tourist loop.|$|E

500|$|At a {{time when}} the {{institutions}} of government, both local and federal, are being subjected to increasing attack and cynicism, those responsible of the enforcement of the law and the administration of justice cannot afford to allow {{one of the most powerful}} means of combatting official corruption to be emasculated by unwarranted, restrictive interpretation.
