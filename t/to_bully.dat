40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze how employees’ {{position}} in the social network affects their exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours at work and how this exposure in turn affects group dynamics. Design/Methodology Longitudinal data on exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours (NAQ – short version) and network data on relationship quality (friendship relations; difficult relations) were collected in eight Finnish organizations. Hypotheses were tested based on two waves of data (n = 249) using stochastic actor-oriented modeling for the coevolution of networks and attributes, as implemented in RSiena. Results Contrary to expectations, the number of friends and the number of difficult relations (T 1) had no effect on exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviour (T 2). However, respondents with higher exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours at T 1 reported both more friendships and more difficult relations at T 2, suggesting that on the group level bullying behaviour might lead to group polarization. Also, employees’ exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours was affected by the bullying behaviours experienced by their friends, pointing to contagion or social influence effects. Limitations RSiena does not allow taking into account the multilevel nature of the data. Research/Practical Implications The findings highlight the importance of taking into account group dynamics for understanding exposure <b>to</b> workplace <b>bullying</b> and its consequences. Originality/Value The study introduces a new methodological approach <b>to</b> workplace <b>bullying</b> research, making it possible to take into account dynamics of social networks and the interdependencies between the actors and their responses <b>to</b> workplace <b>bullying...</b>|$|R

This study examined students’ evaluations of and reported likelihood of adopting four different victim responses (angry, sad, confident, and ignoring). Fifth- and seventh-grade students (N =  206; mean age =  11. 13 and 13. 18  years, respectively) viewed hypothetical videotaped scenarios portraying either physical or verbal bullying among same-sex peers and completed online questionnaires. While students rated the confident and ignoring victim responses as more effective overall, they reported a greater likelihood of adopting sad and angry responses <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> This pattern suggests a gap between what students “know” and what students report they would actually “do” if faced with bullying themselves. Some gender and age variations were also identified.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{association}} between weight status and exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> among 11 -, 13 - and 15 -year-old Danish school children. Furthermore, the purpose was to investigate the potentially mediating effect of body image. Methods: Data from the Danish contribution to the international cross-sectional research project Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) 2002 was used. Data were assessed from questionnaires and 4781 students aged 11 -, 13 - and 15 -years old were included in the analyses. Logistic regression was used for the analyses. Results: The regression analyses showed that overweight and obese students were more exposed <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> than their normal weight peers. Among boys, odds ratios (ORs) for exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> were 1. 75 (1. 18 – 2. 61) in overweight and 1. 98 (0. 79 – 4. 95) in obese boys compared with normal weight. Among girls, the corresponding ORs were 1. 89 (1. 25 – 2. 85) in overweight and 2. 74 (0. 96 – 7. 82) in obese girls. The mediation analyses showed that body image fully mediated the associations between weight status and exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> in both boys and girls. Conclusions: This study shows that overweight and obese boys and girls are of higher odds of being exposed <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> than their normal weight peers. Moreover, this study finds that body image may statistically explain this association between overweight and exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> However, the study is cross-sectional, and hypotheses of possibilitie...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} the socioeconomic distribution of adolescent exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> internationally and documented {{the contribution of}} the macroeconomic environment. Methods. We used an international survey of 162 305 students aged 11, 13, and 15 years from nationally representative samples of 5998 schools in 35 countries in Europe and North America for the 2001 – 2002 school year. The survey used standardized measures of exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> and socioeconomic affluence. Results. Adolescents from families of low affluence reported higher prevalence of being victims of bullying (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 13; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 10, 1. 16). International differences in prevalence of exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> were not associated with the economic level of the country (as measured by gross national income) or the school, but wide disparities in affluence at a school and large economic inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) at the national level were associated with an increased prevalence of exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> Conclusions. There is socioeconomic inequality in exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> among adolescents, leaving children of greater socioeconomic disadvantage at higher risk of victimization. Adolescents who attend schools and live in countries where socioeconomic differences are larger are at higher risk of being bullied.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze how employees’ {{position}} in the social network affects their exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours, and how this exposure in turn affects their positive ties (“friendship”) and negative ties (“difficult” relations) at work. Thus, the study explores the interdynamics of perceptions of negative behaviours and negative and positive relationships. Longitudinal data on perceived exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours (NAQ – short version) and network data on relationship quality (friendship relations; difficult relations) were collected in eight small and medium-sized organizations in Finland. Hypotheses were tested based on two waves of data (n = 249) using stochastic actor-oriented modeling. Given the multilevel nature of the data (respondents nested in organizations), different approaches for analyzing the data were explored. Contrary to expectations, initial analyses suggest that neither degree centrality in the network of difficult relations, nor degree centrality in the friendship network at T 1 had any effect on perceived exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours (T 2). However, respondents who experienced higher exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> behaviours at T 1 reported both more friendships (endowment effect) and more difficult relations (creation effect) at T 2. This suggests that at the group level, <b>bullying</b> might contribute <b>to</b> group polarization.

40|$|Bullying in {{workplaces}} is {{a problem}} thought to harm individual productivity. This paper investigates whether being exposed <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> in the workplace increases long-term sickness absence. We analyze employees from a selection of workplaces from The Bullying Cohort Study conducted in Denmark in 2006. The Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was used to avoid bias related to self-labeling as being bullied. We account for important confounders, such as historical information on sickness absence and mental health, obtained through rich registry data. Our results show that gender does not significantly explain exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> and that exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> is associated with negative immediate self-reported health for both genders. We also find, however, that only bullied females have higher, persistent increases in long-term sickness absence and adverse long-term health. This suggests {{that men and women}} have different coping strategies. We investigate plausible explanations for this and find that the differences cannot be explained by, for example, turnover or lack of employment. Although insignificant, our results nonetheless indicate that men {{are twice as likely to}} leave the labor force immediately after exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the prospective association between supervisor leadership styles and workplace bullying. Altogether 404 civil servants from a local government in Japan completed baseline and follow-up surveys. The leadership variables and exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> were measured by Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised, respectively. The prevalence of workplace bullying was 14. 8 % at baseline and 15. 1 % at follow-up. Among respondents who did not experience bullying at baseline (n= 216), those who worked under the supervisors as higher in passive laissez-faire leadership had a 4. 3 times higher risk of new expo-sure <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> On the other hand, respondents whose supervisors with highly considerate of the individual had a 70 % lower risk of new exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> In the entire sample (n= 317), passive laissez-faire leadership was significantly and positively associated, while charisma/inspiration, individual consideration, and contingent reward were negatively associated both after adjusting for demographic and occupational characteristics at baseline, life events during follow-up, and exposure <b>to</b> workplace <b>bullying</b> at baseline. Results indicated that passive laissez-faire and low indi-vidual consideration leadership style at baseline were strong predictors of new exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> and high individual consideration leadership of supervisors/managers could be a preventive factor against bullying...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} was to explore the association between {{the characteristics of the}} exposure <b>to</b> workplace <b>bullying</b> and depressive symptoms in a large sample of employees of the French working population. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 3132 men and 4562 women of the French general working population in the southeast of France. Inclusion criterion was to have a work experience of at least 3 months. Cases of bullying were defined using both Leymann's definition and self-report of being exposed <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D scale. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, which were age, marital status, presence of children, educational level, and occupation, exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> was found <b>to</b> be a risk factor for depressive symptoms for both men and women. The more frequent the exposure, the higher the risk of depressive symptoms. Past exposure <b>to</b> <b>bullying</b> increased the risk of depressive symptoms. Observing <b>bullying</b> was found <b>to</b> be a risk factor for depressive symptoms and increased the risk further still among women exposed <b>to</b> <b>bullying.</b> All these associations were found to be highly significant (P<. 001).
