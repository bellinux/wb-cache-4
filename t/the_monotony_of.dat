5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} {{frustration}} with <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} these new routes offered a more {{efficient}} way {{to get into the}} lower town than the cramped streets of rue du Midi/Zuidstraat, rue des Fripiers/Kleerkopersstraat and rue Neuve and helped revitalize the lower quarters of the town. In order to accomplish this revitalization and attract investment, public buildings were constructed as part of the Léon Suys project including the Brussels Stock Exchange. The vast Halles Centrales/Centrale Hallen, a good example of metallic architecture, replaced unhygienic open-air markets, though it was torn down in 1958. The monumental fountain that was to break <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> the boulevards at Fontainas Square was abandoned for budgetary reasons.|$|E

5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve to break up <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, {{in that they are}} dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{participated in}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in February 1908 in the Baltic Sea and more fleet training off Helgoland in May–June. In July, Hessen {{and the rest}} of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued on to the Atlantic. During the cruise, Hessen stopped at Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures. The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern as in 1908. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which Hessen stopped in El Ferrol, Spain. While on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. Late in the year, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the commander of the High Seas Fleet. His tenure as fleet commander was marked with strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld took a 3–2 lead in sets over Mark Webster in {{the third}} round of the 2014 World Championship, but from there on could not win another leg as he exited the tournament losing 4–3. He had a poor run of form in the UK Open Qualifiers to be placed 66th on the Order of Merit meaning he entered the tournament in the first round stage. Van Barneveld enjoyed four {{comfortable}} victories to reach the fifth round where he was comprehensively beaten 9–2 by Adrian Lewis. He produced some of his most consistent darts in years during the Premier League as he remained unbeaten for 12 matches during the season to finish second in the table. In the semi-finals he secured his first ever win over Phil Taylor in the tournament after 21 attempts, having fought back from 4–1 down to triumph 8–5. It {{was the first time he}} had advanced beyond the semi-finals of the event, after losing at this stage in six previous years. Van Barneveld then won four successive legs from 5–5 in the final against Michael van Gerwen and went on to win the title 10–6. His finishing proved to be the difference between him and the rest of the nine players as throughout the 18 matches his checkout percentage was 50.22, seven percent higher than Simon Whitlock in second place. Afterwards, Van Barneveld revealed he had received therapy for depression in January due to <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> travelling and playing in events every week.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{disagreed}} on the originality of the musicwhile Seward {{claimed that}} it was new and inventive, Murat Batmaz, of Maelstrom, said {{that it was}} very typical funeral doom metal. Negative reviews and comments talked about the poor production and guitars, and the lack of speed in the music, combined with <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> the sound. Seward felt that the album [...] "is not 'heavy' music in the least, if we’re talking volume and crunch", but that [...] "it is 'heavy' music if we’re talking about the end product: a deep and pervasively creepy atmosphere that is compelling in its use of silence and hushed reverence for the forest floor".|$|E
500|$|While piecing {{together}} the final {{components of the}} album, the band recorded a video for [...] "Warped". They asked Flea's brother-in-law, Gavin Bowden, to direct it. The video involved Kiedis and Navarro kissing towards the end {{as a way of}} breaking <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> cumbersome video recording. Thinking nothing of it, they continued to shoot and finished several days later. Warner Bros., however, saw the video and instantly wanted it thrown away, considering it to be unmarketable and that the kiss would alienate {{a large portion of the}} band's fan base. The band came to a consensus to let the kiss remain on the final cut, prompting a backlash from the college segment of their audience, who took offense at the action. Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "If they couldn't accept what we were doing, we didn't need them anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|The strip's header {{declared}} {{to each side}} of the title [...] "He just simply couldn't stop" [...] and [...] "He never knew when it was coming", and never strayed from the basic formula of build-up, release, and consequence. [...] McCay was to make use of such framing devices throughout his career, as in Little Nemo where the reader could rely on the protagonist awakening in the closing panel each week. Scott Bukatman and Thierry Smolderen saw <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> Sammy Sneeze as an attempt by McCay at parody—one that, in Smolderen's words, [...] "chuckles at the absurdity of... doing the same thing ad nauseam". Noah Berlatsky objected to the idea, calling the strip [...] "excessive and infantile, linked, not to a sense of irony, but a sense of wonder", which he compared to the [...] "eternal appetite of infancy" [...] that G.K.

500|$|Critics such as Mueller were {{generally}} more negative about the gameplay, finding it repetitive.

GamePro concluded that [...] "the downfall of Children of Mana is its repetitiveness," [...] and Chandran felt that most players would be sick of the gameplay before finishing half of the game. The reviewers from the Japanese Shūkan Famitsū magazine, while giving the game an especially high score, noted that the gameplay could be considered insufficient compared to prior titles in the series. Bozon, while giving the game a more positive review than many others, felt that the thinness of the gameplay was bolstered by the multiplayer component, saying that [...] "the game's entertainment value goes up in leaps and bounds during multiplayer", a point with which Fahey agreed to a lesser extent.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{historic}} championship title, Gore was not {{enthusiastic about}} the new sport of lawn tennis.

That anyone who has really played well at cricket, tennis, or even rackets, will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis, beyond showing himself to be a promising player, is extremely doubtful; for in all probability <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> the game as compared with others would choke him off before he had time to excel in it." [...] He did return for the 1878 Championship to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to Frank Hadow, a coffee planter from Ceylon, who effectively used the lob to counter Gore's net play. It was Gore's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1937 {{the theatre}} {{proprietor}} Ronald Russell offered Hordern {{a part in}} his repertory company, the Rapier Players, who were then based at Colston Hall in Bristol.

Because of the play's success, Russell employed him in {{the same type of}} role, <b>the</b> <b>monotony</b> <b>of</b> which frustrated the actor who longed to play the leading man. It was whilst with the Rapier Players that Hordern fell in love with Eve Mortimer, a juvenile actress who appeared in minor roles in many of Russell's productions. Hordern considered his experience with the Rapier Players to be invaluable; it taught him how a professional theatre company worked under a strict time frame and how it operated with an even stricter budget. [...] He was allowed two minutes to study each page of the script, but because of the frequent mistakes and many stalled lines, rehearsals became long and laborious. Hordern described the company's props as being made to a very high standard, despite being bought on a shoe-string budget.|$|E

In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, [...] "reiterating rituals that hardly please him". He masturbates in the confines of his shower; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, [...] "confined [...] nearly crossed out".
