25|$|Though the {{stockpile}} of CAIS were destroyed decades ago, there remained {{the problem of}} what to do with CAIS found buried underground. Most of the other 80,000 or so CAIS were used during training but some were disposed of, the primary method of disposal was burial. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency was assigned the task of destroying CAIS as they were found, usually through ongoing construction projects. When CAIS items are found the Chemical Materials Agency's Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel Project (NSCMP) is tasked to destroy them using the Single CAIS Access and Neutralization System (SCANS), a small, hand-held container used to access and treat recovered CAIS. After treatment, the SCANS is overpacked in a Department of Transportation-approved <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> and shipped to a permitted facility for final treatment and disposal of the entire SCANS container and its waste contents.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, K. W. Jeter, a {{personal}} friend of Philip K. Dick, began developing a series of Blade Runner novels that {{would serve as a}} continuation of both the film Blade Runner, and the novel upon which it was based, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. The first of these novels, Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human, was published on October 1, 1995. The novel was set several months after the events of Blade Runner, following Deckard living in an isolated shack outside of Los Angeles, with Rachael with him in a Tyrell <b>transport</b> <b>container,</b> intended to slow down the replicant aging process. Deckard is called in by the human template of Rachael, Sarah Tyrell, to hunt down a missing replicant in exchange for technology allowing Rachael to live. Meanwhile, Roy Batty, the human template for the replicant of the same name, hires Dave Holden, a blade runner previously attacked by Leon, to help him hunt down the man that he believes to be the sixth replicant – Deckard. A screenplay loosely adapting The Edge of Human, entitled Blade Runner Down, was written by Stuart Hazeldine in 1996; the film's development was shelved due to rights issues concerning the novel.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies a new {{automated}} {{container terminal}} (ACT) system which utilizes multistory frame bridges and rail-mounted trolleys to <b>transport</b> <b>containers</b> between the quay and the yard. Beside typical ACT systems use trucks or automated guided vehicles for <b>transporting</b> <b>containers</b> between quay cranes and yard cranes, {{the new design}} uses three types of handling machines, namely, ground trolleys (GTs), transfer platforms (TPs), and frame trolleys (FTs). These three types of handling machines collaborate with one another to <b>transport</b> <b>containers.</b> This study decomposes the system into several subsystems. Each subsystem has one TP and several FTs and GTs dedicated to this TP. Then, a Markov chain model is developed to analyze the throughput of TPs. At last, {{the performance of the}} new ACT system is estimated. Sensitivity analyzes the numbers, and the processing rates of trolleys are conducted through the numeric experiments...|$|R
