25|$|The Los Angeles Police Department {{contacted}} Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a {{close friend}} of Bill Cosby for many years, to ask for his phone number. Waters declined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> instead asking another close friend, Essence magazine publisher Ed Lewis, {{to be the one to}} tell Cosby. However, the police contacted the CBS studio which produced his new series, Cosby, filmed in New York at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Cosby was on set at the time when producer Joanne Curley-Kerner informed him of the death of his son. Los Angeles police later spoke with him and discouraged him from flying to Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the Court {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} not allowing tribes to prosecute nonmembers, those nonmembers would escape prosecution altogether for criminal activity engaged in within tribal boundaries. The federal government retains the power to prosecute felonies that take place on reservations. Tribes retain the power to expel undesirable persons. Tribal authorities may still arrest the nonmember and detain him until he can be handed over to authorities who do {{have the power to}} prosecute the nonmember. The tribe pointed out that state authorities can lack the power to prosecute crimes committed by nonmembers on reservations; Arizona, for instance, expressly disclaims this prosecutorial authority. But Congress has allowed states to assume this power, and Arizona is free to take up Congress's invitation. Finally, if the tribes still believed that there remained a [...] "jurisdictional void," [...] despite these options, they could persuade Congress <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

60|$|Billy Barton, however, did more. He joined an {{expedition}} which Dan Hewlett was already organising with Joe Todd, {{as much for}} revenge as profit, to have a night of poaching in Mr Selby's woods, in which {{there were a number}} of fine pheasants, not so many as at present where preserves are strictly kept, but poaching was more profitable in some ways, since in those days poulterers were not allowed to sell game openly, but gave a higher price to men who could contrive to convey it to them, and then sold it at a great profit to pretentious people, who had no friends <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but who wanted to show it at their dinner-parties. Tirzah Todd, as usual, was the means of disposing of most of these gains. Her lively ways made poulterers and servants inclined to further her dealings.|$|E

60|$|Now for one intense moment I thought, {{as hard as}} ever I {{had done}} in my life. It was evident--unless he dealing very cunningly with me, which I did not believe--that Cetewayo knew nothing of Anscombe and Heda, but thought that I had come into Zululand alone. Should I or should I not tell him and beg his {{protection}} for them? If I did so he might refuse or be unable <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> far away {{in the midst of}} a savage population aflame with the lust of war. As the incident of the morning showed, it was as much as he could do to protect myself, although the Zulus knew me for their friend. On the other hand no one who dwelt under Zikali's blanket, to use the Kaffir idiom, would be touched, because he was looked on as half divine and therefore everything under it down to the rat in his thatch was sacred. Now Zikali by implication and Nombe with emphasis, had promised to safeguard these two. Surely, therefore, they would run less risk in the Black Kloof than here at Ulundi, if ever they got so far.|$|E
6000|$|LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I {{have been}} somewhat, {{in my own}} mind, complimented by {{a large portion of}} Judge Douglas's speech,--I mean that portion which he devotes to the {{controversy}} between himself and the present Administration. This is the seventh time Judge Douglas and myself have met in these joint discussions, and he has been gradually improving in regard to his war with the Administration. At Quincy, day before yesterday, he was a little more severe upon the Administration than I had heard him upon any occasion, and I took pains to compliment him for it. I then told him <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> with all the power he had; and as some of them were present, I told them I would be very much obliged if they would give it to him in about the same way. I take it he has now vastly improved upon the attack he made then upon the Administration. I flatter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject. All I can say now is to re-commend to him and to them what I then commended,--to prosecute the war against one another in the most vigorous manner. I say to them again: [...] "Go it, husband!--Go it, bear!" ...|$|E

Sunday afternoon, Captain Atkinson and Mrs. Atkinson and their little girl in a push-wagon, come here, and I told 'em you was gone away; but they says they would stop a minute, and could I give them a drink; an' I had nothin' <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> but an old chicken-bowl that I had washed out, for even the dipper was in the house, an' I told 'em {{everything}} was locked up, which was true enough, though they must 'a' thought you was a queer kind of people; but I wasn't a-goin' to say nothin' about the dog, fur, to tell the truth, I was ashamed to do it. So as soon as they'd gone, I went down into the cellar,--and it's lucky that I had the key for the outside cellar door,--and I got a piece of fat corn-beef and the meat-axe. I unlocked the kitchen door and went in, with the axe {{in one hand and}} the meat in the other. The dog might take his choice. I know'd he must be pretty nigh famished, for there was nothin' that he could get at to eat. As soon as I went in, he came runnin' to me; but I could see he was shaky on his legs. He looked a sort of wicked at me, and then he grabbed the meat. He was all right then." ...|$|E
