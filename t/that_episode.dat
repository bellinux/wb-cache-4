5|$|An {{announcement}} was made on July 13, 2006 stating <b>that</b> <b>Episode</b> Two would be released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 {{in addition to the}} PC, where previous iterations of the series separated. It was originally rumored <b>that</b> <b>Episode</b> Two would be delayed until 2008. On June 14, 2007, however, Valve confirmed the release date for Episode Two to be October 9, 2007 for all announced platforms. Valve handled the development of the game for the PC and Xbox 360, while Electronic Arts British office in Chertsey worked on the PlayStation 3 version of the game. It was announced on September 7, 2007 that the PlayStation 3 version of the game would be delayed because the development studio behind the game was in the United Kingdom, away from Valve's development team, and therefore lagged behind in its schedule. Valve's marketing director, Doug Lombardi, gave assurance that the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game would be identical in functionality and performance.|$|E

For the eighth season, the show abandoned the style of titles used for the previous two seasons {{and returned to the}} original form of showing the characters at school while participating in school-related activities.

5|$|The {{family was}} {{conceived}} by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, {{and the show}} was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired <b>that</b> <b>episode</b> in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Triple H {{wrestled}} Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. He suffered a storyline concussion and was deemed to have forfeited.

In response, Triple H stormed out the arena and vowed to return to the ring the next week on Raw.

5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} at the end of <b>that</b> <b>episode</b> and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E
5|$|His first {{television}} appearance {{was in a}} debate {{about the existence of}} flying saucers following a spate of reported sightings in the 1950s; Moore argued against Lord Dowding and other UFO proponents. He was invited to present a live astronomy programme and said the greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune; the opening of Jean Sibelius's Pelléas et Mélisande was chosen and used throughout the programme's existence. The programme was originally named Star Map before The Sky at Night was chosen in the Radio Times. On 24 April 1957, at 10:30 pm, Moore presented the first episode about the Comet Arend–Roland. The programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers, in a format which remained consistent from its inception. Moore presented every monthly episode except for one in July 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for <b>that</b> <b>episode</b> by Chris Lintott. Moore appears in the Guinness World Records book as the world's longest-serving TV presenter having presented the programme since 1957. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was broadcast from Moore's home, when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios. Over the years he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks, but rejected them because he held a 'gentlemen's agreement' with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} WrestleMania, both the New Breed and the ECW Originals began {{attempting}} to recruit CM Punk into their stables. On the April 3 episode of ECW, Cor Von eventually told Punk {{to choose a}} side, stating that Punk was either with the New Breed or against them. The following week, Punk made his decision and joined the New Breed, shaking hands with Burke in the ring. The next week, his presence immediately created tension within the group, as he berated Cor Von and Thorn for losing and undermined Burke's position {{as the leader of}} the New Breed. Later <b>that</b> <b>episode,</b> Burke faced Van Dam in a singles match. Punk attempted to interfere, sliding a steel chair into the ring, but Van Dam got to it first and hit Burke with it. Afterward, Punk apologized to Burke. The following week, Punk apologized again, but was forced by Burke to miss an eight-man elimination tag team match between the Originals and the New Breed. In retaliation, Punk attacked Burke, causing him to lose the match, and left the New Breed.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of Raw. Later on <b>that</b> <b>episode,</b> Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on an episode of Raw, Michaels and Flair were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who was the better wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between Flair and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, Flair and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, Flair and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into a commercial break.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed on the glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in <b>that</b> <b>episode</b> herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E
