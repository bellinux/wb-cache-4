5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|Already {{a friend}} of the {{composer}} Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{suffered}} {{a series of}} minor strokes in the late 1960s, which {{marked the beginning of}} a slow decline in his health. Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, The Freak, a story of a winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria. His fragile health prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> The Circus. In 1971, he was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, he was honoured with a special award by the Venice Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the matches}} at SummerSlam 1993 were {{a result of}} Razor Ramon's loss to The Kid (later the 1-2-3 Kid) on the May 17, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw. Following Ramon's loss to the newcomer, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) teased Ramon about the match. DiBiase offered Ramon {{a job as a}} servant, which Ramon angrily refused. Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> <b>and</b> the Kid {{accepted}} the challenge. Ramon helped the Kid win the match by distracting DiBiase. It was decided that the feuds would be settled in two singles matches at SummerSlam, with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid.|$|E
5|$|To repair Zulf's {{damage to}} the Bastion, the Kid starts {{collecting}} Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion {{had the ability to}} somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Hawks {{returned}} to the screwball comedy genre with His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, which had already been made into a film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kipling's India for Gunga Din in 1939. In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck {{to help them with}} modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.|$|E

2500|$|Aaron Copland ( [...] ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer, {{composition}} teacher, writer, {{and later}} a conductor {{of his own and}} other American music. Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as [...] "the Dean of American Composers." [...] The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as [...] "populist" [...] and which the composer labeled his [...] "vernacular" [...] style. Works in this vein include the ballets Appalachian Spring, Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Rodeo, his Fanfare for the Common Man and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.|$|E

2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to {{the back of my head}} out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes <b>the</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>and</b> [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
