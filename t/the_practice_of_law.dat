5|$|As the 1876 presidential {{election}} approached, Garfield was {{loyal to the}} candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October.

5|$|From his {{earliest}} involvement in politics, Cleveland {{aligned with the}} Democratic Party. He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and {{the heads of the}} Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took him away from <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (US$ today) over the two-year term.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, he {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in New York. He tried to control the policies of President Adams (1797–1801). In 1798–99, Hamilton called for mobilization against France after the XYZ Affair and became commander of a new army, which he readied for war. However, the Quasi-War was never officially declared and did not involve army action, though it was hard-fought at sea. In the end, President Adams found a diplomatic solution that avoided a war with France. Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election. Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency {{in the electoral college}} in 1801, and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.|$|E
5|$|In April 1866, Sprigg {{relocated}} to Moorefield in the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia {{and established a}} law partnership with former judge J.W.F. Allen. Due to West Virginia's disenfranchisement of Confederate sympathizers and belligerents, Allen was unable to practice law, and Sprigg initially carried the burden of arguing the practice's cases. The law firm was immediately successful, and Sprigg continued <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> in Hardy County for over 23 years, during which time he argued in every important civil and criminal case held in that county court. In addition to Hardy County, Sprigg and Allen were also members of the Hampshire County bar.|$|E
