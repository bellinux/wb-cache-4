5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> {{rather than the}} continuous <b>time</b> <b>domain.</b> All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E

25|$|Thus, using just {{truncation}} in the <b>time</b> <b>domain,</b> or equivalently {{low-pass filters}} {{in the frequency}} domain, one can cut out any convex set in time–frequency space; just using <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> or frequency domain methods without fractional Fourier transforms only allow cutting out rectangles parallel to the axes.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{interpretation}} of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the {{interpretation of}} the inverse Fourier transform is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can transform a signal (either in the <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.|$|E
