5|$|There are Roman remains {{buried beneath}} the town, {{such as a}} Roman bath and section of {{pavement}} between Eastbourne Pier and the Redoubt Fortress. There is also a Roman villa near the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pier</b> and the present Queens Hotel.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian era Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town; before {{that it had}} been an {{agricultural}} village. The Victorian craze for bathing in the sea was catered for in the late 19th century by saltwater baths adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> (since demolished, though the foundations remain), and bathing machines on the main beach.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 the {{holdings}} of the St Anne's Land & Building Company (including the pier) were {{bought by the}} Amalgamated Investment Company, based in London. Some alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{were made by the}} new owners, including the addition of an aviary and a reptile house. The Floral Hall was refurbished and turned into a Tyrolean-style beer garden.|$|E
500|$|After 1975, various {{attempts}} were made <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> Supporters complained that the council {{was more interested in}} developing Brighton Marina. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> became <b>the</b> only one in Britain to be awarded Grade I listed status. The West Pier Trust was formed <b>to</b> save <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> and bought it from the council in 1983 for a peppercorn fee of £100, though the council also demanded £800,000 required for immediate repairs before it could be opened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. A proposal <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> with a [...] ferris wheel failed after the backer went bankrupt.|$|R
2500|$|Port Victoria {{station was}} {{located at the}} head of <b>the</b> [...] long <b>pier.</b> Ships of up to [...] draught were able to draw-up {{alongside}} to take passengers and goods, irrespective of <b>the</b> tides, thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier's</b> deep water front. A 'temporary' hotel was constructed near <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> at a cost of £1,900.|$|R
50|$|The {{port system}} {{visually}} links Miramare Castle, Barcola and San Giusto Castle and follows three directions: a central one, connecting the port with the city, a second one, corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers,</b> {{and a third}} one, adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railway.|$|R
5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops {{and part of the}} deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|The shore at Clevedon is {{a mixture}} of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour being at {{the western edge of the}} town at the mouth of the Land Yeo river. The rocky beach has been {{designated}} as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is the side of a mineralised fault, which runs east-west adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> and forms a small cliff feature in Dolomitic Conglomerate on the north side of Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte together with sulfides. The minerals identified at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this assemblage has produced idaite, covellite and other copper sulfides. The nearest parking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> entrance is on an esplanade above the rocky beach.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Pier Hotel is a Grade II listed {{building}} located next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> The Royal Pier Hotel {{was built in}} 1823 by Thomas Hollyman, and originally called The Rock House. In 1868, the building was expanded by local architect Hans Price and renamed Rock House & Royal Pier Hotel, later shortened to Royal Pier Hotel. Since its closure the building has fallen into disrepair, but it is now (Summer 2015) being converted into luxury apartments.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 2,800,000 {{cubic yards of}} {{dredging}} was necessary to remove shoals from the seaplane runway and <b>to</b> deepen <b>the</b> anchorages and channel approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> Gasoline storage, totaling 75,000 gallons, was provided in eleven underground steel tanks.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012 {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> at auction failed.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} renovation, all 44 <b>piers</b> {{that support}} <b>the</b> Tabernacle's roof were {{reinforced}} with steel bars, which were inserted into <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> from <b>the</b> bottom. The foundation of each pier was also reinforced with concrete. Steel boxes were used to connect trusses, and were also attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers,</b> clinched tight with structured steel.|$|R
5|$|The {{coastguard}} {{began using}} the castle as a signalling station in 1898. In 1901, the War Department passed the castle to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and in 1912 {{parts of the}} castle were leased <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pier</b> Hotel, which incorporated Robert Holmes's former mansion; the Pier Hotel eventually became the George Hotel and still occupies {{part of the old}} castle moat. The Office of Works took control of the castle in 1913, carrying out a programme of repairs, and it was used by the military in both the First and Second World Wars. It was finally retired from military use in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town, having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater for the late 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following {{the opening of a}} branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of the}} country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pier</b> Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of five truss spans supported on two concrete abutments and four common concrete <b>piers.</b> <b>The</b> concrete <b>piers</b> are <b>the</b> {{width of the}} bridge, and have buttress-like quoining at each end, with rendered detailing. <b>The</b> two northeastern <b>piers</b> are located on the northern embankment, with <b>the</b> remaining two <b>piers</b> located within <b>the</b> river. The two concrete embankments have rendered details similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of February 2003, Governor R. M.

25|$|As {{part of the}} Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games the 525-metre long William Barak {{footbridge}} {{was built}} east-west from Birrarung Marr to Yarra Park. Stated in 2005 and opened in 2006. The bridge {{is yet to be}} completed, with scaffolding and formwork still attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1984, £1 {{million of}} damage was caused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> by {{drifting}} equipment during engineering work in Sand Bay, {{to the north}} of the pier. The damage was quickly repaired, despite fears that Birnbeck might become like nearby Clevedon Pier, which at the time was severed by a collapsed span. The pier was again badly damaged by storms in 1990 and was closed for safety reasons in 1994. Daily trips during the summer months to and from Cardiff, Clevedon, and Penarth were suspended indefinitely. Due to the decline, English Heritage has placed it on the Heritage at Risk register. In 1999, the lifeboat station installed a walkway across the pier to allow them safe access to the island, at a cost of £20,000.|$|E
5|$|Pat Moran, {{the foreman}} of a {{construction}} gang, {{worked hard to}} save up {{enough money to pay}} for the passage of his wife and daughter to their new home in America.

50|$|Over {{the next}} several decades the city of Santa Monica {{proposed}} various plans to tear down Newcomb Pier, {{and with it the}} Hippodrome. The city council approved a plan <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> with a resort island in Santa Monica Bay. Local activists formed Save Santa Monica Bay and shot down that plan, and in 1973 the city formally revoked a standing order <b>to</b> demolish <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> <b>The</b> city acquired ownership of <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> in summer 1974. In the 1980s it was almost destroyed by winter storms.|$|R
50|$|The spans {{for the new}} bridge were {{constructed}} adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge site on the northern side of Long Island, raised <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct height, placed onto barges and floated out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> at high tide. Upon completion of the new bridge, the old bridge was removed, however <b>the</b> sandstone capped <b>piers</b> remain. <b>The</b> construction docks remain in situ.|$|R
40|$|Static pushover analysis，linear and {{non-linear}} dynamic response {{analysis of}} ten kinds of {{steel portal frame}} bridge piers were carried out.

50|$|Shortly {{after this}} another barge {{engaged in the}} work was carried {{upstream}} and struck one of <b>the</b> other <b>piers,</b> demolishing <b>the</b> fenders but causing little damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> themselves. Passing <b>the</b> bridge upstream, it later moved downstream again and struck one of the columns, removing about 8 square feet of the cast-iron caisson. The barge capsized three or four miles downstream with total loss of life.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pier</b> was {{proposed}} by Lieutenant George Crichton of the London, Leith, Edinburgh and Glasgow Steam Navigation Company. In 1820 the Lord Provost and magistrates of Edinburgh granted the company permission for <b>the</b> <b>pier's</b> construction. <b>The</b> company then transferred <b>the</b> permission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Trinity Pier Company {{who were to}} administer construction and operate <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> and they in turn commissioned Captain Samuel Brown <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> as his first independent project. Alexander Scott WS, one of the trustees of the company, granted permission <b>to</b> build <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> on his land. Scott and Alexander Stevenson were directors of the Trinity Pier Company, and Crichton was treasurer. It cost £4000 to build.|$|R
