5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal).|$|E
40|$|I {{consider}} an argument by Plotinus {{to show how}} the notion of transcendence is used in explaining the nature of knowledge. The argument is set forth in sections 4 - 6 of the treatise V. 8 (31). In my opinion this argument provides {{a good example of the}} philosophical frame of Platonism. I sum up this frame in the following theses: a) for a <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> is to be real and true; so that for a <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> real and being true is equivalent; but b) for a <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> real and true means being intelligible; that is to say: a thing could be understood because that thing is a being; thus, c) for a <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> is the identity of its ontological and epistemological nature...|$|R

5|$|The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, {{among other}} <b>things,</b> <b>being</b> the world's leading complex {{automatic}} fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system. According to Octopus Cards Limited, operator of the Octopus card system, {{there are more than}} 20 million cards in circulation, nearly three times the population of Hong Kong. The cards are used by 95% of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over HK$130 million.|$|E
5|$|Sayers {{was drafted}} by the Chicago Bears in the first round, fourth overall, in the 1965 NFL Draft, and was also picked fifth overall by the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League in the AFL draft. He decided that all <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, he would rather play in Chicago, and so after {{consulting}} his wife he chose to sign with George Halas's Bears. In his rookie year, he scored an NFL-record 22 touchdowns: 14 rushing, six receiving, and one each on punt and kickoff returns. He gained 2,272 all-purpose yards, a record for an NFL rookie, with 1,371 of them coming from scrimmage. Sayers averaged 5.2 yards per rush and 17.5 yards per reception. His return averages were 14.9 yards per punt return and a league-high 31.4 yards per kickoff return.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by KID, with direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, and said that the game was only possible through the staff working very hard, and a lot of <b>things</b> <b>being</b> worked on at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "nothing" [...] in {{the example}} above has two meanings, as presented: [...] "nothing is better" [...] means the <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> named has the highest value possible; [...] "better than nothing" [...] only means that the <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> {{described}} has some value. Therefore, [...] "nothing" [...] acts as two different words in this example, thus creating the fallacy of four terms.|$|R

25|$|All <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, using fewer decks {{decreases}} the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten {{on their first}} card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{assumption}} {{is made in}} the statement of Ohm's law: other <b>things</b> <b>being</b> alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} begins {{from the}} observation that in equilibrium, total income must equal total output. Assuming that income has a direct effect on saving, {{an increase in the}} autonomous component of saving, other <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, will move the equilibrium point at which income equals output to a lower value, thereby inducing a decline in saving that may more than offset the original increase.|$|E

25|$|A {{method of}} {{preserving}} numeric information in clay {{was invented by}} the Sumerians between 8000 and 3500BC. This was done with small clay tokens of various shapes that were strung like beads on a string. Beginning about 3500BC, clay tokens were gradually replaced by number signs impressed with a round stylus at different angles in clay tablets (originally containers for tokens) which were then baked. About 3100BC, written numbers were dissociated from the <b>things</b> <b>being</b> counted and became abstract numerals.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory has}} {{implications}} for understanding {{the different types of}} litter reduction interventions that will most effectively reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, passive littering will be more resistant to change because of two psychological processes: 1. diffusion of responsibility that increases as the latency between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.|$|E

25|$|All <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, at {{any given}} time, if the {{maturity}} of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a higher CDS spread is considered more likely to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening. However, factors such as liquidity and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison. Credit spread rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among money managers {{to be the best}} indicators of the likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.|$|E
25|$|Many {{web sites}} {{benefit from a}} network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges. For example, eBay {{would not be a}} {{particularly}} useful site if auctions were not competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more <b>things</b> <b>being</b> sold that people want. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.|$|E
25|$|Public-key {{algorithms}} {{are based}} on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is integer factorization (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the discrete logarithm problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, other <b>things</b> <b>being</b> equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.|$|E
