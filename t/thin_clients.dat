5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} {{information technology system}} developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 and will have been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup and will have two redundant server centers. Personnel {{have access to the}} system via <b>thin</b> <b>clients.</b> The police have a system to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online.|$|E

25|$|Terminal servers {{have also}} been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a {{terminal}} connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with <b>thin</b> <b>clients,</b> which use up to 1/8 {{the amount of energy}} of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption. There has been an increase in using terminal services with <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include Terminal Services for Windows and the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) for the Linux operating system.|$|E
25|$|A {{limitation}} of X terminals and most <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> {{is that they}} are not capable of any input or output other than the keyboard, mouse, and display. All relevant data is assumed to exist solely on the remote server, and the X terminal user has no methods available to save or load data from a local peripheral device.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Microsoft {{released}} Windows Thin PC or WinTPC, {{which is}} a feature- and size-reduced locked-down version of Windows 7 expressly designed to turn older PCs into <b>thin</b> <b>clients.</b> WinTPC is available for software assurance customers and relies on cloud computing in a business network. Wireless operation is supported since WinTPC has full wireless stack integration, but wireless operation {{may not be as}} good as the operation on a wired connection.|$|E

40|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>client</b> {{computing}} trades {{local processing}} for network bandwidth consumption by offloading application logic to remote servers. User input and display updates are exchanged between client and server through a <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> protocol. This <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> protocol traffic {{can lead to}} a significantly higher power consumption of the radio interface of the wireless device. In this contribution, we present a cross-layer algorithm that exploits <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> protocol layer information to determine intervals where no traffic from the server is expected. During these intervals, the wireless network interface card (WNIC) is instructed to enter the energy conserving sleep mode. Using this algorithm for a remote text editor, WNIC energy consumption reductions of 21 - 52 % can be achieved...|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{approach to}} limiting {{the consequences of}} laptop theft is to issue <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> devices to field employees instead of conventional laptops, so that all data will reside on the server and therefore may be less liable to loss or compromise. If a <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> is lost or stolen, it can easily and inexpensively be replaced. However, a <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> depends on network access to the server, which is not available aboard airliners or any other location without network access.|$|R
25|$|Like all <b>thin</b> <b>clients,</b> {{when using}} X across a network, {{bandwidth}} limitations can impede {{the use of}} bitmap-intensive applications that require rapidly updating large portions of the screen with low latency, such as 3D animation or photo editing. Even a relatively small uncompressed 640x480x24bit 30fps video stream can easily outstrip the bandwidth of a 100Mbit/s network for a single client. In contrast, modern versions of X generally have extensions such as MESA allowing local display of a local program's graphics to be optimized to bypass the network model and directly control the video card, for use of full-screen video, rendered 3D applications, and other such applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{guaranteed}} {{cycle count}} may {{apply only to}} block zero (as {{is the case with}} TSOPNAND devices), or to all blocks (as in NOR). This effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors; this technique is called wear leveling. Another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure, a technique called bad block management (BBM). For portable consumer devices, these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications. For high reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use flash memory that would {{have to go through a}} large number of programming cycles. This limitation is meaningless for 'read-only' applications such as <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> and routers, which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes.|$|E
2500|$|The lab also {{supported}} {{a number of}} Sun Microsystems <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> for use by students enrolled in AP Computer Science. In 2008, the school received a grant from Sun Microsystems for $388,048, which was student-written. The Syslab was given 7 Sun workstations, 12 Sun servers, and 145 Sun Rays for distribution throughout the school. These {{were placed in the}} existing AP Computer Science Lab and the science classrooms, support backend services, and serve as kiosks placed around the school for guests, students, and faculty. However, the Sun Rays were taken out of the AP Computer Science Lab due to teachers' objections. By 2014, the Sun Ray clients were decommissioned, and [...] replaced with Linux-based <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> running LTSP.|$|E

40|$|In a <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> {{computing}} environment, applications run on server {{farms and}} are accessed through <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> protocols like Remote Frame Buffer (RFB), or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Although they {{work well in}} high and stable bandwidth networks, <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> protocols require some modifications {{to adapt to the}} varying characteristics of wireless networks and to reduce the energy consumption of <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> mobile devices. In this paper we present both upstream and downstream adaptive protocol optimizations. In the upstream direction, user events are buffered to reduce packetization overhead. In the downstream direction an adaptive scheduling-based transmission pattern is adopted. Our solution shows we can reduce the bandwidth consumption while preserving the Quality of Experience. Those adaptive mechanisms were developed as part of MobiThin FP 7 -funded European project...|$|R

50|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>clients</b> {{have their}} roots in {{multi-user}} systems, traditionally mainframes accessed by some sort of terminal computer. As computer graphics matured, these terminals transitioned from providing a command-line interface to a full graphical user interface, as is common on modern advanced <b>thin</b> <b>clients.</b> The prototypical multiuser environment along these lines, Unix, began to support fully graphical X terminals, i.e., devices running display server software, from about 1984. X terminals remained relatively popular even after the arrival of other <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> in the mid-late 1990s. Modern Unix derivatives like BSD and Linux continue {{the tradition of the}} multi-user, remote display/input session. Typically, X software is not made available on non-X-based <b>thin</b> <b>clients,</b> although no technical reason for this exclusion would prevent it.|$|E
