5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, <b>the</b> <b>infantry</b> attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until <b>the</b> <b>infantry</b> had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and <b>the</b> <b>infantry</b> moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from <b>the</b> <b>infantry.</b> It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>infantry</b> declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E

Thereafter, 'Abd el-Hamid ordered tank-hunting squads – groups of ten equipped with RPG-7 rockets and RPG-43 grenades – to deploy around al-Galaa' and destroy those tanks that broke through; he also sent a tank company to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>infantry</b> battalion.|$|E

5|$|As at Orsogna, the 18th Armoured Regiment {{was to play}} a {{supporting}} role in the forthcoming attack on Cassino, with <b>the</b> <b>infantry</b> of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} battle.

The regiment's tanks were first used at Cassino as artillery support for two weeks, each squadron being rotated in three-day stints to a position overlooking the town. Then in mid-April, one squadron was detached to remain on the Cassino front while the other two squadrons were withdrawn for training. The regiment remained fragmented into May, for once training was completed, another squadron was detached and sent into Cassino itself to man tanks which had been effectively set up as pillboxes.|$|E

Over the next week, some of the squadrons of the regiment became involved in small scale raid actions. On 24 March, the regiment moved into the area of Cassino controlled by the New Zealand infantry, and essentially became mobile pillboxes. The tanks were vulnerable to artillery and German patrols and the troops of the various squadrons of the regiment were rotated {{in and out of the}} town in two day shifts. While the New Zealand infantry had been relieved by the Guards Brigade in the early April, the 20th Armoured Regiment stayed in the line until the end of the month.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} performance of <b>the</b> <b>infantry,</b> both comitatenses and limitanei, is a recurrent feature of Ammianus' history.
