50|$|Canada's {{official}} diplomatic {{position in}} relation to the Vietnam War was that of a non-belligerent, which imposed a ban on the export of war-related items to the combat areas. Nonetheless, Canadian industry was also a major supplier of equipment and supplies to the American forces, not sending these directly to South Vietnam but to the United States. Sold goods included relatively benign items like boots, but also aircraft, munitions, napalm and commercial defoliants, the use of which was fiercely opposed by anti-war protesters at the time. In accordance with the 1958 Defence Production Sharing Agreement, Canadian industry sold $2.47 billion in materiel to the United States between 1965 and 1973. Many of the companies were owned by US parent firms, but all export sales over $100,000 US (and thus, the majority of contracts) were arranged through the Canadian Commercial Corporation, a crown corporation which acted as an intermediary between the United States Department of Defense and Canadian industry. In some cases Canadian defence contractors were even sent to the theatre of war to carry out company work such as when DeHavilland Aircraft of Canada sent mobile repair teams from the Downsview (Toronto) plant to carry out depot level repair on battle damaged DeHavilland Caribou aircraft that were owned and operated by the U.S. Army.

40|$|Due to the {{implementation}} of new legislation, such as REACh, a dramatic increase of animal use for toxicity testing is expected and the search for alternatives is timely. Cell-based in vitro assays are promising alternatives. However, the behavior of chemicals in these assays is still poorly understood. We set out to quantify the exposure and associated toxicity of chemicals with different physicochemical properties toward a fish gill cell line when different solvents and procedural steps are used to introduce test chemicals to cells. Three chemicals with a range of hydrophobicity and volatility were selected and delivered in three different solvents using two common dosing procedures. Toxicity tests were coupled with chemical analysis to quantify the chemical concentrations within culture wells. The impact of solvents and dosing procedure was greatest for the most volatile and hydrophobic <b>test</b> <b>chemical.</b> We show that certain combinations of the <b>test</b> <b>chemical,</b> solvent, and procedural steps can lead to inhomogeneous distribution of the <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> and thus differing degrees of bioavailability, resulting in quantitative differences in apparent toxicity...|$|E
40|$|A {{co-culture}} clonal survival assay {{was developed}} to measure the cytotoxicity of <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> treatments to BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells because the standard clonal survival assay using 200 wild type (WT) cells frequently overestimates chemical cytotoxicity when compared with identical treatment doses in high-density cultures. The assay used co-cultures of 3. 2 x 10 (4) WT cells, the same seeding density used in the transformation assay, and 200 ouabain resistant (OUAr) cells. After a 48 -hr <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> treatment, co-cultured cells were fed with culture medium containing 4 mM ouabain. The <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> was cytotoxic to an equal percentage of WT and OUAr cells. Ouabain treatments killed the remaining WT cells. Thus, OUAr cells surviving the <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> treatment measured the relative cloning efficiency (RCE) of all treated cells in the high-density cell co-culture. The co-culture assay succeeded because metabolic cooperation at the OUAr locus was not detected in BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells. Five chemicals induced comparable cytotoxic responses in both assays, including actinomycin D, 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine, N'-methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine, dimethyl sulfoxide and sodium chloride. In contrast, chemical cytotoxic responses detected in the standard and co-culture assays differed by > or = 10 -fold for 11 -aminoundecanoic acid, benzo[a]pyrene, cytosine arabinoside, and 3 -methyl-cholanthrene and differed by > 2 -fold for 2 -acetylaminofluorene and dimethylnitrosamine.

Appropriate selection of benchmark chemicals also allows pseudo-first-order rate constants for physical removal processes such as volatilization and sediment burial to be quantified.
