5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; he says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since {{the impact of the}} food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} {{could be}} deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in {{animals that are}} aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E

5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E
5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E

5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} the possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> {{is due to}} quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died {{in a similar fashion}} due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990).

If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E

However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, was convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could {{the density of the}} Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials.

It is also worth noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that while it is true <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned.
