500|$|The fourth devil, Toby (Wally Dalton), is {{convinced}} that Black really does {{know that they are}} demons. Toby also recounts his story, in which he begins to feel ennui at his failure to damn humans for some time. He meets and courts an aging stripper, Sally, who falls in love with him. [...] Their relationship blossomed, despite her having seen his true demonic form. One day Toby leads her to believe he is about to propose to her, before instead curtly insulting and breaking up with her. He later visited her home to find police investigating her suicide—a successful damnation. However, he also encounters Black, who sees his true nature. Instead of recoiling or reacting, Black simply tells Toby that he sees how lonely he must be. Toby's story affects all the gathered demons, who realize how lonely they really are. As <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to leave, Abum praises the shop's coffee and briefly reveals his true form to the waiter.|$|E
500|$|Doctor Who had {{previously}} aired two related specials for Comic Relief. The {{first was the}} 1999 spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, which was also written by Steven Moffat. The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] {{are considered to be}} canonical. The canonicity of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike Curse of the Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather [...] "a little miniature story" [...] {{in the style of the}} Children in Need mini-episodes. He described it as [...] "A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. But obviously life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened. As I'm sure it is every day when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and have their coffee..." [...] The concept of a TARDIS inside the TARDIS had been previously explored in The Time Monster (1972) and Logopolis (1980), though both times it was the TARDIS of the Master. Amy also repeats one of her lines from [...] "The Big Bang" [...] at the end of [...] "Space".|$|E

"And <b>they</b> came <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> as <b>they</b> are <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> <b>up</b> there; <b>they</b> wear {{something}} like an ornamented jacket, doublet, or long blouse, which they tie at their middle, their waist; there they place a katana of metal, which counts as their swords. ... They seem bold, not gentle and meek people, going about like eagles" [...] Chimalpahin diary, [...] "Annals of his time" [...] 16 December 1610, p171.|$|R

6000|$|... 'That {{would soon}} come. If <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> this tower ruling plannards {{together}} much longer, their plannards will soon rule them together, {{in my way}} o' thinking. If she've a disposition towards the knot, she can soon teach him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Looks better,” Clay agreed. “But when I {{have the}} fellows down, it seems prudent {{to see that}} <b>they</b> don’t <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again too soon.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's it," [...] Bruno assented. [...] "Sylvie {{tells me}} the words, and then, when I jump about, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> shooken <b>up</b> in my head-- till they're all froth!" ...|$|R
60|$|Before Tom could reply <b>they</b> heard Dick <b>getting</b> <b>up,</b> {{and also}} their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah, that's the plan!" [...] cried {{another of}} the party. [...] "They'll think we are over here, {{waiting for them to}} show up at ten o'clock to-morrow morning. Won't they be {{surprised}} when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and find the things minus!" ...|$|E
60|$|You don't {{know what}} an {{existence}} they lead down there. It is pure, unadulterated country life. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early {{because they have}} so much to do, and go to bed early because they have so little to think about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not particularly! I {{know very}} well that young men do get into trouble when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to London. If you want any--any advice, or that sort of thing, you may come to me; for I knew your father well. Do you like shooting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] Reuben said, [...] "we {{must get}} to our feet, and pick off the blacks as they run. <b>They</b> will <b>get</b> <b>up</b> like a covey of partridge, as the {{horsemen}} come among them." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: At Dinorwig Quarry, {{workers from}} Anglesey were housed at the Anglesey barracks during the week. <b>They</b> would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> at 3 a.m. on Monday morning {{to walk to}} the ferry, and return home on Saturday afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will not, Major; one day {{is enough}} for me. If <b>they</b> would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a donkey race {{confined}} strictly to the subalterns of the station, I might take the trouble to go and look at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They will be {{here before}} the others, Jack; but I doubt if {{they will be in}} time. Water will be breast-high before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> and they may drop anchor down {{at the mouth of the}} Ray, and not see us. Our best chance is the shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Darry," [...] said Mrs. Fairfield. [...] "The colonel has {{to think}} up {{a great number of}} things whereby to {{interest}} his men. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> all sorts of contests, and concerts and theatricals, and go hunting when they can get the chance--anything to keep them from growing too dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, look, Aunt Wee! {{how they}} open, one by one, {{as the light}} shines on them! We shan't have to wait any longer; for <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> with the sun, as you do." [...] As she spoke, Daisy caught a half-open lily, and drew it up, {{fragrant}} and dripping, fresh from its sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "These yer knowin' boys is allers aggravatin' and sarcy," [...] said a coarse-looking fellow, {{from the}} other side of the room; [...] "that's why <b>they</b> <b>gets</b> cut <b>up</b> and marked so. If they behaved themselves, they wouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the crew}} {{are all on}} board. The boat is to be on shore for the captain at nine o'clock, and {{as there is a}} little breeze blowing, I expect <b>they</b> will <b>get</b> <b>up</b> sail and start at once." ...|$|R
60|$|The noise the {{two boys}} made in moving around the room aroused the others, and soon <b>they</b> too were <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{just where}} it is, sir. Those fellows {{do nothing but}} sleep all day, and then after dark <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and begin to prowl. They spy, some of 'em, on the young people courting, and follow 'em 'ome and {{blackmail}} 'em. They're a bad lot, sir. They wouldn't work {{if they could get}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Mr. Weller, 'the adwantage o' the plan's hobvious. At {{six o'clock}} every mornin' they let's go the ropes at one end, and down falls the lodgers. Consequence is, that being {{thoroughly}} waked, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> wery quietly, and walk away! Beg your pardon, sir,' said Sam, suddenly breaking {{off in his}} loquacious discourse. 'Is this Bury St. Edmunds?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, boys," [...] called Ladd, as he {{crouched}} down to reload his rifle. [...] "Save your shells. The greasers are spreadin' on us, some goin' down below Yaqui, others movin' {{up for that}} high ridge. When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> there I'm damned if it won't be hot for us. There ain't room {{for all of us}} to hide here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all talk, Andy. <b>They</b> couldn't <b>get</b> <b>up</b> such a party around here. Folks {{know better}} than to bother me. Besides, they know I am a good spender, and they like to help, not hinder, me," [...] and the ranch owner winked.|$|R
60|$|They {{swung around}} and {{commenced}} their journey. Quest {{stood with his}} watch in his hand. <b>They</b> were <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> the anchor of the Durham, and from higher up the river came the screech of steamers beginning to move on their outward way.|$|R
6000|$|... "We will <b>get</b> <b>up</b> too, {{and give}} the knight his coffee," [...] said Nora. <b>They</b> did <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> and saw him off; and when Mr. Glascock and Caroline parted with a lover's embrace, Nora stood by as a sister might have done. Let us hope that she remembered that her own time was coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've heard him," [...] said Gordon dryly. [...] "He's {{from the}} desolate Bush back East, {{and nobody has}} taught him to express himself clearly. The men of that kind are handiest with the axe and drill, but it has always {{seemed to me that}} the nations are going to sit round and listen when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and speak their mind some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They make {{frequent}} visits, {{send out}} invitations, and organise picnics. In the town <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> charity concerts, balls, sports, and horse-races. It {{is a curious}} thing that the English, {{even when they are}} at war, cannot live without their usual sports, and the conquered do not show the slightest repugnance to joining the victors in their games or to mixing in society with them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Each man {{come for}} his ration before he sits down," [...] he said. [...] "It {{would be better}} if you did not sit down at all, for I know well enough that when my countrymen sit down to a meal it is a long time before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again, {{and we have to be}} in the forest again in three-quarters of an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Surajah, you {{can take}} a shot from the window of that side. The others will be here in a minute, and it is just as well to let them know where we are, before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> close <b>up</b> to our door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you move}} forward with the men here, Parucchi. Knock down the fellows on deck, and rush into the {{forecastle}} and overpower them there, before <b>they</b> can <b>get</b> <b>up</b> their arms. I will summon the rest in a body, and we will overpower the officers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect <b>they</b> are <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> steam {{on board}} the 'Falcon,'" [...] Hawtry said, [...] "and no doubt there is a nice row over our being missing. I'd give a good sum, if I had it to give, {{to be back on}} her decks again." ...|$|R
