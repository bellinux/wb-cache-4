5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
5|$|San José y Las Animas found Cofresí, {{and mounted}} a {{surprise}} attack. The sailors aboard hid while Cofresí, recognizing the ship {{as a local}} merchant vessel, gave the order to attack it. When Anne was within range, the crew of San José y las Animas opened fire. Startled, the pirates countered with cannon and musket fire while attempting to outrun the sloop. Unable <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> San José y las Animas and having lost two members of his crew, Cofresí grounded Anne and fled inland. Although a third pirate fell during the landing, most scattered throughout rural Guayama and adjacent areas. Cofresí, injured, was accompanied by two crew members. Half his crew was captured shortly afterwards, but the captain remained at large until the following day. At midnight a local trooper, Juan Candido Garay, and two {{other members of the}} Puerto Rican militia spotted Cofresí. The trio ambushed the pirate, who was hit by blunderbuss fire while he was fleeing. Despite his injury, Cofresí fought back with a knife until he was subdued by militia machetes.|$|E

5|$|To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in {{addition}} to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos. His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80million. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength {{in order to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 {{plans were}} {{announced}} <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> an area's 'mill town' image and rejuvenate the town over a 10–15-year period {{to appeal to}} a younger generation. The plan involves creating new retail, business and community spaces, demolishing 300 flats and houses and replacing them with 1,000 new homes.|$|E
25|$|Politically, {{this area}} {{was one of the}} first in Alabama <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> its Democratic roots. It was one of five {{district}}s to swing Republican in 1964, when Barry Goldwater swept the state; the GOP has held the district in every House election since then. However, conservative Democrats continued to hold most state and local offices well into the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Zarbienus; early mid-1st century BC: A king of Corduene {{who made}} overtures to Appius Claudius when {{the latter was}} staying at Antiocheia, wishing <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the yoke of Tigranes.

When Lucullus arrived he celebrated his funeral rites with great pomp, setting fire to the funeral pile with his own hand, and had a sumptuous monument erected to him.|$|E
25|$|With Thomas Bromley, the Solicitor General from 1569, Gerard had {{to settle}} many {{problems}} of jurisdiction. One {{of the most important}} concerned an attempt in 1576 by Worcester and Worcestershire <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the authority of the Council of Wales and the Marches - a bid which Gerard and Bromley turned down. Gerard must have been disappointed that it was Bromley, about a decade younger than himself, who was appointed Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1579, although he was rewarded with a knighthood in that year.|$|E
25|$|In Great Britain, MMA {{failed to}} {{capitalise}} on this momentum {{and has not}} seen anywhere near the popularity levels MMA has received in USA. It is hard to pinpoint the main reason why exactly this has happened. The failure of MMA promoters to secure a substantial and locked TV deal until late last year. The reluctance of broadcasting powerhouses BBC and Sky Sports to fully support the sport? The stereotype of extreme violence {{that they have been}} unable <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off?</b> All of these are valid reasons why MMA failed to capture the public’s imagination.|$|E

25|$|The Mali Empire {{has enjoyed}} {{virtually}} no military reverses {{in its first}} century of existence and had grown at a terrific rate in both size and wealth by the time Ibn Battuta arrived there. However this wealth and power {{may have been the}} reason behind more aggressive attacks by its neighbors as well as the complacency of some of the mansas in dealing with them. Subject peoples on the fringes of the empire slowly began <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the yoke of Mandinka hegemony. This happened slowly at first, but after 1450 the empire would begin to crumble very rapidly.|$|E
25|$|My beloved children, I do {{not know}} what you await <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E
25|$|The group {{now faces}} the {{additional}} burden {{of having to}} take care of a baby and a dog. They initially try to give Karli to another family on the island, but no-one is willing to take him in. As the group realize they have no choice but to take Karli with them, Sigurd finally catches up after having chased them for 16 days. Thorfinn distracts Sigurd by lying to him that Gudrid already died at sea. However, as he is lamenting his failure, Sigurd spots Gudrid and Full-Eyes climbing up a hill. Enraged, Sigurd gives chase but Gudrid and Full-Eyes escape by jumping from the cliff into the sea and swimming to the ship. In order <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> Sigurd, Leif decides to sail further north.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, {{since the}} {{usurpation}} by Emir Muhammad in Kilwa back in 1495, sheikh Isuf had been charting an independent course for his community in Sofala. The Portuguese, with their powerful ships, seemed {{to offer the}} key <b>to</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>off</b> Kilwa's authority. At any rate, the elderly sheikh Isuf realized {{it would be better}} to make allies rather than enemies out of the Portuguese, and so agreed to Aguiar's proposals and signed a treaty of commercial and political alliance with the Kingdom of Portugal.|$|R

25|$|Hagler's next {{challenger}} was Sugar Ray Leonard, who {{was returning}} to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years.) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler {{a larger share of}} the purse Leonard obtained several conditions which would be crucial to his strategy; a 22x22ft ring, 12oz gloves and the fight was to be over 12—not 15—rounds. Leonard was 2 years younger, had half as many fights, and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' fights behind closed doors (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no head gear) in order <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> his ring rust. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the betting favorite.|$|E
25|$|Wells contemplates {{the ideas}} of nature and nurture and {{questions}} humanity in books such as The Island of Doctor Moreau. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a dystopian novel, When the Sleeper Wakes (1899, rewritten as The Sleeper Awakes, 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have {{become more and more}} separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers. The Island of Doctor Moreau is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.|$|E
25|$|The {{emancipation}} was {{not merely}} a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation. Alexander {{had to choose between}} the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> serfdom. The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother Konstantin, Yakov Rostovtsev, and Nikolay Milyutin. On 3 March 1861, six years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.|$|E

25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|Led by four {{companies}} of Grenzers under Beaulieu's son-in-law Captain Gustave Maelcamp and the 250 volunteers, Pittoni's column began pressing the 75th Line near Pegli at 3:00 PM. They captured two hills near Pegli in a bayonet attack. Under Chef de brigade Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin, the 75th Line held {{out in the}} Pegli area until around 6:00 PM when they withdrew to avoid being cut off. Four companies were briefly surrounded but {{they were able to}} break out. By 7:00 PM the bulk of the 75th Line was able <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> Austrian pursuit and fall back along the coast. In the sector facing the Turchino Pass, the French defenders fell back to a fortification at Mele around 5:00 PM. Cervoni evacuated Mele when Vukassovich threatened to turn his left flank.|$|E
25|$|Male M. drewseni only spend 4.8 days in {{the nest}} after they emerge and {{spend the rest of}} their lives outside of the nest. Once they leave the nest, males tend to {{circulate}} where specific females are because of feeding and foraging opportunities. On their circuits, males seek out nectar from flowers and also seek out mates. Observations have shown that if a male sees a female nearby, he will alter his flight path and pounce on the female to attempt copulation. In most cases, the female is able <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>off</b> the male and fly away. If two males come in contact with the same female, they will usually attack each other and the male that first found the female will try to bite the second male.|$|E
