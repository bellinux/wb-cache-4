Its threshold temperature Tth can be programmed {{by adjusting the}} ratios of width and length of the transistors. The operating principles of the <b>temperature</b> <b>switch</b> circuit is theoretically explained.

40|$|The Karnik-Mendel {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} compute the centroid of interval type- 2 fuzzy sets, determining the <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> needed for the lower and upper bounds of the centroid, through an iterative process. It is commonly acknowledged {{that there is no}} closed-form solution for determining such <b>switch</b> <b>points.</b> Many enhanced algorithms have been proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the Karnik-Mendel algorithm. However, all of these algorithms are still based on iterative procedures. In this paper, a direct approach based on derivatives for determining the <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> without multiple iterations has been proposed, together with mathematical proof that these <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> are correctly determining the lower and upper bounds of the centroid. Experimental simulations show that the direct approach obtains the same <b>switch</b> <b>points,</b> but is more computationally efficient than any of the existing (iterative) algorithms. Thus, we propose that this algorithm should be used in any application of interval type- 2 fuzzy sets in which the centroid is required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Adaptive {{switching}} between multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission schemes like {{diversity and}} spatial multiplexing yields significantly higher capacity gains over fixed transmission schemes. Previous work {{has shown the}} impact of channel correlation and SNR on the switching between different schemes like beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper explores the influence of antenna geometry on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> between these transmission schemes. Closed-form expressions for the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> for a two element uniform linear array (ULA) {{as a function of}} antenna geometry and channel statistics are derived. The impact of the channel parameters and antenna geometry on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> is also shown by simulations. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the impact of varying antenna array configurations on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> between beamforming and spatial multiplexing. I...|$|R

This paper addresses a related question: Can these same <b>switch</b> <b>points,</b> found empirically in a multitasking context, be inferred solely from single-task data? We investigate this question and propose an approach that analyzes a particular behavioral signature in single-task data—outliers in the distributions of time between task actions—to infer multitasking breakpoints.

40|$|In eusocial insects, {{inclusive}} fitness theory predicts potential queen–worker {{conflict over}} {{the timing of}} events in colony life history. Whether queens or workers control the timing of these events is poorly understood. In the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris, queens exhibit a ‘switch point’ in which they switch from laying diploid eggs yielding females (workers and new queens) to laying haploid eggs yielding males. By rearing foundress queens whose worker offspring were removed as pupae and sexing their eggs using microsatellite genotyping, we found that queens kept in the complete absence of adult workers still exhibit a <b>switch</b> <b>point.</b> Moreover, the timing of their <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> relative {{to the start of}} egg-laying did not differ significantly from that of queens allowed to produce normal colonies. The finding that bumble-bee queens can express the <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> in the absence of workers experimentally demonstrates queen control of a key life-history event in eusocial insects. In addition, we found no evidence that workers affect the timing of the <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> either directly or indirectly via providing cues to queens, suggesting that workers do not fully express their interests in queen–worker conflicts over colony life history...|$|R
