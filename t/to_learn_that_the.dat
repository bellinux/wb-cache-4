5|$|Megan Mullally was {{originally}} {{going to provide}} {{a voice in the}} film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show Will & Grace was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.|$|E

Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> network had put his son on the air.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E

5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots {{in a few months}} in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|Brian {{begins to}} search for a way {{to get back to the}} United States, but Stewie refuses to leave with him and insists they travel to London. Brian and Stewie search for a camel to use as transportation, and they perform a musical number as a {{diversion}} in order to steal one. They begin their journey, but the camel dies in the middle of the desert. They soon find a nearby Comfort Inn, however, in which to stay. They steal a hot air balloon from the hotel premises and make their way to the Vatican City, embarrassing the Pope upon landing, then traveling by train from Switzerland to Munich, and end up in Amsterdam. Upon finally arriving at the BBC Television Centre, Stewie is horrified <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely tired out, disinterested actors. Enraged, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in her shoes. This ordeal also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him perhaps too old to hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E

5|$|Džakula and Ećimović were sacked {{from their}} {{government}} positions, {{and from the}} positions of regional authority in the RSK-held western Slavonia.

On 21 September, Džakula and Ećimović were arrested, and taken to Knin prison and then to Glina while the investigation was in progress. On 3 December, they were released only <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arrest of the two, and Kulić, was ordered days later.

5|$|Müllerian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Fritz Müller. When a distasteful animal comes {{to resemble a}} more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism for {{this was one of}} the first uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> black and yellow colours mean a stinging insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of them also. But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.|$|E

Moments later, the servant rushes into the room attracted by cries to see Jack bending over the wounded baron with a knife in hand. Both the aunt and the baron accuse him of the stabbing as well as the servant and a policeman, who also saw Jack with the knife. In court, the jury finds it to be a clear case and Jack is sentenced to ten years in prison.|$|E

5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gibraltar Police were handling the police {{investigation into the}} shootings, having been closely involved in the {{events leading up to}} them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
5|$|At Tina's scan, Tina's {{pregnancy}} paternity results uncover Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) is the baby's father, not {{her boyfriend}} and Jacqui convinces {{her to keep}} quiet. Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) attacks Tina upon discovering she is considering adoption. Tina gives birth to a boy, Max McQueen (Brayden Haynes-Mawdsley) naming him after Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) and then has to have an emergency hysterectomy. Tina then decides to keep Max. Niall holds all the McQueens' hostage in a church and when Myra arrives, she soon learns that Niall is her son.

Myra comes to a tough decision and chooses Jacqui and Carmel to die. Jacqui is devastated and Niall detonates the explosives and blows up the church and Tina dies. Jacqui confronts Mercedes and Tony, only <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> baby Mercedes aborted, was in fact Tony's. This pushes her over the edge. She takes Max from Michaela and refuses to forgive Tony, Mercedes or Myra. Jacqui begins to spend Tony's money and does anything to hurt him, even by sleeping with Mark Gascoyne (Craig Russell). Jacqui and Tony separate and she realises she needs to forgive Myra. Jacqui's cousin Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) arrives and has sex with Tony.

5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
