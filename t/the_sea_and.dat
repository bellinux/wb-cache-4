50|$|The 1997 treaty {{essentially}} {{separates the}} sovereignty of <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> water column in the area between the water column boundary <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> boundary, whereby Australia has sovereignty over <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> its resources, while Indonesia has sovereignty over the water column and the resources which live in it.|$|R
5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E

5|$|Various human {{cultures}} have depicted pinnipeds for millennia. The anthropologist, A. Asbjørn Jøn, has analysed {{beliefs of the}} Celts of Orkney and Hebrides who believed in selkies—seals that could change into humans and walk on land. Seals are also of great importance {{in the culture of}} the Inuit. In Inuit mythology, the goddess Sedna rules over <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> marine animals. She is depicted as a mermaid, occasionally with a seal's lower body. In one legend, seals, whales and other marine mammals were formed from her severed fingers. One of the earliest Ancient Greek coins depicts the head of a seal, and the animals were mentioned by Homer and Aristotle. The Greeks believed that seals loved both <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods Poseidon and Apollo. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> its animals, and often depicted sea lions in their art. In modern popular culture, pinnipeds are often depicted as playful and comical figures based on their performances in zoos, circuses and marine mammal parks.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> <b>and</b> therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|According to {{linguistic}} sources, the Baltic tribes precursors appeared first inland, in {{the forest}} zone regions far from <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> <b>and</b> only later settled the near Baltic Sea areas, extending from the northeastern part of the Vistula basin to the Daugava River basin. This westbound expansion resulted {{in the establishment of}} the two main Baltic branches: The Western Balts, represented by the extinct Old Prussians and Yotvingians, and the Eastern Balts including the modern nations of Lithuanians and Latvians.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>and</b> again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E

This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E

Similar updates to <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> Army Cadet programs rationalize the connectivity between the three programs and more efficiently provides the training that is common to all three elements.|$|E
40|$|A coupled {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} dynamic interaction between an offshore pile, a porous <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> seawater when subjected to the pseudo-Stoneley wave along <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater interface. <b>The</b> pile <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> are treated as the porous medium governed by Biot's theory, while the seawater is considered as an acoustic medium and is described by the conventional Helmholtz equation. The free field solution of the incident pseudo-Stoneley wave is obtained using Biot's theory and the potential method. Based on the boundary element method (BEM) for the porous medium and the acoustic medium, three BEM formulations are constructed for <b>the</b> pile, <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater, respectively, which are combined together using the continuity conditions between <b>the</b> pile, <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater to formulate the coupled model for the system. As shown in numerical examples, when the system is subjected to the pseudo-Stoneley wave, the maximum pore pressure of <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> usually occurs at the region near the interfaces between <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater.
