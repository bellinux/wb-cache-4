[...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> the sense of superiority you get.

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> that in a week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave {{her a chance to}} have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|Their Child is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film begins with Ellen Stokes whose extravagant lifestyle is outside {{the means of the}} family. While their only son is hosting a birthday party, the husband informs Ellen that they are financially ruined because of her. Ellen attempts to get money from her uncle, who refuses, and a friend of the family soon comes to her aid with a loan. Ellen is deceptive in telling who provided the money and her jealous husband soon learns the truth. In anger, he takes the child and leaves. The child soon returns to Ellen and she whisks him away to a new home where she fails to obtain gainful employment. The son decides to sell newspapers for some money and in <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> recognized by his father, soon the family is reunited. Marie Eline played the role of [...] "their child" [...] and was likely so well disguised that the reviewer for The Nickelodeon believed her to be a boy. The film was released on October 21, 1910, and was met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

[...] Keeping <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> a condition of Angel's parole; even so, it's doubtful that the ever-shifty Angel would be capable of doing so, except that his brother-in-law owns the paper.

2500|$|The novel lacks a clear {{narrative}} and frequently delves into the surreal, never quite distinguishing {{between what is}} real and what is only imagined by the characters. The basic synopsis revolves around journalist Raoul Duke (Hunter S.

However, <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> repeatedly obstructed by their constant use of a variety of recreational drugs, including LSD, ether, cocaine, alcohol, mescaline, and cannabis. This leads to a series of bizarre hallucinogenic experiences, during which they destroy hotel rooms, wreck cars, and have visions of anthropomorphic desert animals, all the while ruminating on the decline of both the [...] "American Dream" [...] and the '60s counterculture in a city of greed.|$|E

Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with statements related to their perceived encouragement {{of participation}} within the organization on a 5 -point scale (1 [*]=[*]strongly disagree, 5 [*]=[*]strongly agree). The items are: “Employees in <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>are</b> often asked by their supervisor to participate in decisions”; “Individuals in <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>are</b> allowed to make decisions”; “Employees are provided the opportunity to suggest improvements in the way things are done”; and “Supervisors keep open communications with employees in this job”.

The sun will rise--the days will be long and pleasant--you can work--do something. You can fish the streams in summer and climb the hills in autumn. You can enjoy. Bah! don't tell me one shallow girl means the world. If Margie hasn't courage enough to run off and marry you--let her go! But you can never tell. Maybe Margie will stick to you. I'll help you.

6000|$|I must {{write you}} again before I {{leave this place}} (which I do {{tomorrow}} noon;) if only to still a little the unrest of my having condemned myself, all too awkwardly, to be so long without hearing from you. I haven't all this while--that is these several days--had the letters which I am believing you will have forwarded to Monterey sent down to me here. This I have abstained from mainly because, having stopped over here these eight or nine days to write, in extreme urgency, an article, and wishing to finish it at any price, I have felt that I should go to pieces as an author if a mass of arrears of postal matter should come tumbling in upon me--and particularly if any of it should be troublous. However, I devoutly hope none {{of it has been}} troublous--and I have done my best to let you know (in any need of wiring etc.) where I have been. Also the letterless state has added itself to the deliciously simplified social state to make me taste the charming sweetness and comfort of this spot. California, on these terms, when all is said (Southern C. at least--which, however, the real C., I believe, much repudiates,) has completely bowled me over--such a delicious difference {{from the rest of the}} U.S. do I find in it. (I speak of course all of nature and climate, fruits and flowers; for there is absolutely nothing else, and the sense of the shining social and human inane is utter.) The days have been mostly here of heavenly beauty, and the flowers, the wild flowers just now in particular, which fairly rage, with radiance, over the land, are worthy of some purer planet than this. I live on oranges and olives, fresh from the tree, and I lie awake nights to listen, on purpose, to the languid list of the Pacific, which my windows overhang. I wish poor heroic Harry could be here--the thought of whose privations, while I wallow unworthy, makes me (tell him with all my love) miserably sick and poisons much of my profit. I go back to Los Angeles to-morrow, to (as I wrote you last) re-utter my (now loathly) Lecture to a female culture club of 900 members (whom I make pay me through the nose,) and on Saturday p.m. 8th, I shall be at Monterey (Hotel del Monte.) But my stay there is now condemned to bitterest brevity and my margin of time for all the rest of <b>this</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> so rapidly shrinking that I see myself brûlant mes étapes, alas, without exception, and cutting down my famous visit to Seattle to a couple of days. It breaks my heart to have so stinted myself here--but it was inevitable, and no one had given me the least inkling that I should find California so sympathetic. It is strange and inconvenient, how little impression of anything any one ever takes the trouble to give one beforehand. I should like to stay here all April and May. But I am writing more than my time permits--my article is still to finish. I ask you no questions--you will have told me everything. I live in the hope that the news from Wm. will have been good. At least at Monterey, may there be some.... But good night--with great and distributed tenderness. Yours, dearest Alice, always and ever, ...|$|E
