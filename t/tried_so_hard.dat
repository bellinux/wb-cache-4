25|$|Thanks to {{some poor}} weather and some {{resolute}} Australian batting {{on the last}} day the Test was a draw, leaving the teams 0–0. Even though the first two Tests had been drawn the press were optimistic about the series. Lindsay Hassett said it wasn't the best team England had sent to Australia, but no other <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to make cricket interesting.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to come. I felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard...</b> It took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I really tried to forget... But of course I was never able to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There {{are certain}} movies {{that serve as}} a {{standard}} bearer for a genre – a high water mark that filmmakers always try to hit, but seem to always come up short. To me, I think Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas is that type of film for the gangster genre. In the 21 years since the film was released, so many filmmakers have <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to copy Goodfellas success, and so few have gotten even close to capturing the magic that Scorsese did {{in one of his}} very best films. The 21 years have been littered with a bunch of pale imitations. To that list, you can add Jonathan Hensleigh’s Kill the Irishman, which wants so desperately to be Goodfellas, and comes up so very, very short." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did." [...] At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her [...] "he felt that someone {{was going to try to}} kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate" [...] and named some names she didn't want to say in the interview.|$|E

[...] This FACA panel's report gave a generally favorable review while providing many specific areas where improvements were needed. [...] The advisory committee's greatest concern was that the report <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to be evenhanded and not overstate what we know, that it came close to leaving the impression that we know little in cases where a lot is known. [...] EPA revised the report to satisfy those concerns and published a response to each of the comments. [...] While not taking issue with the report's findings, the Government Accountability Project complained that EPA delayed releasing the report three months so that its results could be excluded from a regulatory finding about whether greenhouse gases threaten public health.|$|E
