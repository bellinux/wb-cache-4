5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals.

5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was {{inspired}} by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

Additional studies were carried out on fish exposed <b>to</b> <b>lubricating</b> oil, gasoline and diesel oil. Two methods were used to measure the levels of these PAHs: determination of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver extracts, and fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) of PAH in bile. Optimal excitation wavelengths for FF analyses were determined to 290, 260 and 341 nm for naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene, respectively. The optimal emission wavelengths were 335, 380 and 383 nm, respectively. EROD activity and fluorescence intensity increased with increasing PAH concentrations and increasing exposure times. Similar results were obtained after exposure <b>to</b> <b>lubricating</b> oil, gasoline, or diesel oil. There was a high and significant correlation between the two methods. In view of its higher accuracy, lower cost, and convenience FF offered better possibilities than EROD determination to monitor PAH contamination in fish...|$|R

25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E

25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a {{water-based}} paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of scrotal cancer detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Ugine Séjournet, of France, {{invented a}} process which uses glass as a {{lubricant}} for extruding steel. The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the platinum-iridium alloy used to make kilogram mass standards. The process starts by heating the materials to the extruding temperature and then rolling it in glass powder. The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 mils (0.5 to 0.75nbsp&mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls {{and allow it to}} act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18nbsp&mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.|$|E
25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used <b>to</b> <b>lubricate</b> the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E
