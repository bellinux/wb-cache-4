5|$|Entwistle's son, Christopher, gave a {{statement}} supporting the Who's decision to carry on. The US tour {{began at the}} Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino. Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle, and ended with a montage of pictures of him. The tour lasted until September. The loss of {{a founding member of}} the Who caused Townshend <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> his relationship with Daltrey, which had been strained over the band's career. He decided their friendship was important, and this ultimately led to writing and recording new material.|$|E
5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} the IAEA <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E
5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E
5|$|Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band, {{a similar}} series of games {{developed}} by Harmonix (who originally developed Guitar Hero), {{have altered the}} video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games {{to become one of}} the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry.|$|E
40|$|Transhumanists arc {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluating</b> {{the entire}} human condition and offering proposalsfor transcending mortality, principally by augmenting the human body with mechanical components or by transferring the human mind into intelligent hyper-computers. In this essay, the author≈õ methodology is to critique the culture oftranshumanism, arguing, with Barbour, that all technology is tool whose use {{is determined by the}} cultural and socialframeworks within which it is utilized. Transhumanism is characterized as morally ambiguous, extremely individualistic, fixated upon health, vitality, and power, ideological, reductionist, and self-deluded. Its proposed use of technology is, thus, highly suspect and deserves a robust theological response...|$|R

5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of managing adult patients with severe {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome and hypoxemia by means of systems using extracorporeal oxygenation has been questioned. A National Institutes of Health multicentre study, published in 1979, reported survival rates of 9. 5 % and 8. 3 % in extracorporeally and ventilator managed patients, respectively. Another recent study reports survival rates of 33 % and 42 % in ventilator and extracorporealy managed patients, respectively. None of these differences was statistically significant.

40|$|The 39 Ar- 40 Ar {{technique}} {{is often used}} to date the metamorphic evolution of basement rocks. The present review article examines systematic aspects of the K-Ar decay system in different mineral chronometers frequently found in mono- and polymetamorphic basements (amphibole, biotite, muscovite/phengite, K-feldspar). A key observation is that the measured dissolution rate of silicates in aqueous fluids is many orders of magnitude faster, and has a much lower activation energy, than the rate of Fickian diffusion of Ar. The effects of this inequality are patchy age zonations, very much like those observed in many U-Pb chronometers, unaccompanied by intra-crystalline bell¬¨shaped Ar loss profiles. Recognizing the importance of the respective rate constants in field situations leads <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluating</b> the ages and the interpretive paradigms in classic examples such as the Central Alpine "Lepontine" amphibolite event and the Western Alpine eclogitic event...|$|R

25|$|During the 1980s {{there were}} no notable tenure battles, but three were {{outstanding}} in the 1990s. In 1995, the Florida Board of Regents tried <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> academic tenure, but managed only to institute a weak, post-tenure performance review. Likewise, in 1996 the Arizona Board of Regents attempted <b>to</b> <b>re-evaluate</b> tenure, fearing that few full-time professors actually taught university undergraduate students, mainly because the processes of achieving academic tenure underweighted teaching. However, faculty and administrators defended themselves {{and the board of}} trustees dropped its review. Finally, the University of Minnesota Regents tried from 1995 to 1996 to enact 13 proposals, including these policy changes: to allow the regents to cut faculty base- salaries for reasons other than a university financial emergency including poor performance; to fire tenured professors when their programs were eliminated or restructured if the university were unable to retrain or reassign them. In the Minnesota system, 87 percent of university faculty were either tenured or on the tenure track, and the professors vehemently defended themselves. Eventually, the president of the system opposed these changes and weakened a compromise plan by the dean of the law school before it then failed. The board chairman resigned later that year.|$|E
