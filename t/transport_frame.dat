40|$|The {{historical}} {{origins of}} Fermi-Walker transport and Fermi coordinates {{and the construction}} of Fermi-Walker <b>transported</b> <b>frames</b> in black hole spacetimes are reviewed. For geodesics this transport reduces to parallel <b>transport</b> and these <b>frames</b> can be explicitly constructed using a Killing-Yano tensor as shown by Marck. For accelerated or geodesic circular orbits in such spacetimes, both parallel and Fermi-Walker <b>transported</b> <b>frames</b> can be given, and allow one to study circular holonomy and related clock and spin transport effects. In particular the total angle of rotation that a spin vector undergoes around a closed loop can be expressed in a factored form, where each factor is due to a different relativistic effect, in contrast with the usual sum of terms decomposition. Finally the Thomas precession frequency is shown to be a special case of the simple relationship between the parallel transport and Fermi-Walker transport frequencies for stationary circular orbits.

The direct switching of data by autonomous message 'packets' that are assembled by the source instrument on the spacecraft is discussed.

40|$|Freight rail {{is often}} the {{preferred}} method for transportation of dangerous goods. One particular application {{is the use of}} rail to convey radioactive material in purpose built packages. During transit, packages are secured to a rail wagon bed with a tie down system. The design of tie down systems vary considerably depending on package type and rail vehicle, for example shackles, turnbuckles, tie-rods, gravity wells or transport frames are all commonly used. There are also a large number of different packages in existence that all vary in size and mass; typically 1 - 7 m in length and 100 kg - 100 tonnes in mass. Despite the uniqueness of many transport configurations the design of tie down systems is always carried out using a limited set of design load cases as defined in the appropriate Codes of Practice and Standards. Many authors have suggested that the load cases within the standards need revision or question which load cases should apply to which scenario. In a previous experiment accelerations and strains have been measured on a freight wagon and <b>transport</b> <b>frame</b> of a heavy package during a routine rail journey. From these data new insight into the magnitude and nature of loading has been gained. In the present study the measured accelerations have been used as input to a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the <b>transport</b> <b>frame</b> and a method based on correlation between predicted and measured strains has been developed to determine an appropriate low pass filter cutoff frequency, fc, which separates quasi-static loading from raw dynamic data. The residual dynamic measurements have been assessed using signals processing techniques to understand their significance.
