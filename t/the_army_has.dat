5|$|<b>The</b> <b>army</b> <b>has</b> over 30,350 active {{personnel}} and 3,000,000 fit for military service. Military spending has fluctuated widely {{in recent history}} in response to local conditions, especially the 2005–2010 civil war and instability in neighboring countries. In 2009, while in civil war, Chad spent 4.2% of GDP on defense, which fell to 1.6% of GDP in 2011 before rising to 2.0% of GDP in 2013, when Chad began its military intervention in Northern Mali, as it worked with France and other African nations to bring back Mali's sovereignty over territory in the North.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{has used}} tanks from after the First World War, through the interwar period, the Second World War, the Cold War {{and to the}} present day. Throughout this period <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> {{primarily}} been a light infantry force, with its tanks mainly {{being used in the}} direct support role. The Australian Army's tanks have seen combat during the Second World War and the Vietnam War, where they proved successful despite some of the designs employed being considered obsolete. The first Australian tanks were a small number of British medium and light tanks which were operated mainly for training purposes during the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to handle huge {{stockpiles}} of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far {{in excess of}} <b>the</b> <b>Army's</b> needs and <b>had</b> to be disposed of. Hospitals still had to be run, although some were transferred to the Department of Repatriation. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to maintain its schools and training establishments. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>had</b> to field and maintain part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new Australian Regular Army that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.|$|R

5|$|With few modern tanks at {{the time}} of the Korean War, the Australian Army had to rely on British and US tank support. During the 1950s the Army {{standardised}} on the British Centurion tank, which saw action in Vietnam and remained in service until it was replaced with the German Leopard 1 in the mid-1970s. After an internal debate on whether the Army should continue to operate tanks as part of its force structure, the Australian Government replaced the Leopards with a small fleet of American M1A1 Abrams tanks in 2007, which are now the Army's only tanks. In addition to these types, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> operated small numbers of other tank designs for training and evaluation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
