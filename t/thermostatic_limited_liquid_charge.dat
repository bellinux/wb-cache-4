40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{experimental}} {{work in the}} field of evaluation the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> is described. Two different types of soil were analyzed – loam (intermediate plasticity) and sodium bentonite (high plasticity). Two basic methods were used for the evaluation of the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> – Casagrande percussion (cup) method and cone penetrometer method. Two approaches were applied to the evaluation of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> based on cone penetrometer test (30 °/ 80 g cone) – standard method assuming 20 mm penetration at <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> and new calibration line for cone penetrometer <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> - NCCLL (Mohajerani). Experimentally obtained calibration line assumes the influence of depth of cone penetration at <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> on undrained shear strength, which is not unique for all types of soils. The paper presents the comparison of results of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> based on the previously mentioned methods. Presented results of laboratory tests show, that bentonite <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> based on the standard cone penetration test (using 20 mm penetration) is significantly lower in comparison with Casagrande <b>liquid</b> <b>limit.</b> On the other hand was verified very significant consistency of Casagrande <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> and <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> based on NCCLL (evaluated depth of penetration 29 mm).

These limits are {{commonly referred to}} the Atterberg Limits and the <b>limits</b> are the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit,</b> plastic limit and shrinkage limit. Consistency limits is potentially useful as an index property for predicting the behaviour of clay soils. The <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> in particular is used in many correlations with engineering properties. It provides a good basis form predicting the soil properties such as deformability, expansion, hydraulic conductivity and strength. Therefore, <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> has strong links to underlying mechanical behaviour.

This study presents the investigation on the use of oedometer method as an alternative way to determine the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> of zeolite from saturated slurried condition by using a small consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa and 6 kPa. Thus by doing this, one can determine the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> by one point determination technique as the equilibrium water content reached from the consolidation will be equivalent or nearer to the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> of soil under the consolidation pressure either 0. 9 kPa or 6 kPa. The physical properties of zeolite were determined and the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> of zeolite was determined from cone penetration method. The test results shows that by using a consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa, the value of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> obtained from oedometer method is much nearer to the value of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> obtained from the cone penetration method and the difference between those values obtained is less than 1 %. Meanwhile, the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> value obtained by using consolidation pressure of 6 kPa does not tally and far away from the value of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> obtained from cone penetration method. Hence, by using consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa, oedometer method can be used to determine the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> of soil and for consolidation pressure of 6 kPa, other methods or different soil should be used and applied for determination of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> value...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Characterisation {{of marine}} clays is an {{important}} aspect of understanding their behaviour. Investigation showed that there is a good linear relationship between percent clay and <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> and plastic limit. Sand and silt fraction has only diluted the magnitude of <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> and plastic limit. The ratio of plastic <b>limit</b> to <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> is almost a constant irrespective of percent sand fraction and is a function of clay mineral type or mixture of clay minerals, associated cations and ion concentration. Marine clays of Japan around Ariake bay (Hachirogata, Ariake – Ushiya, Meguri, Okishin and Yamaashi) have shown good correlation between plastic and <b>liquid</b> <b>limits</b> and this ratio ranged between 0. 35 to 0. 50 as against 0. 07 (Li-montmorillonite) to 0. 88 (halloysite) of pure clay minerals. Cochin marine clay behaviour compares well with Ariake-Ushiya, although their geological history is entirely different.
