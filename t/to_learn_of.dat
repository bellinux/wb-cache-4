5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} of the coup attempt vary between historians. Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost.

However, the Aleutians campaign meant that fewer ships could be devoted to the Battle of Midway, a turning point during World War Two. The United States armed forces had broken the Japanese communications code, and were able <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese plan to attack the Aleutians by May 21, 1942.

5|$|Early in 1798, rumours reached Jervis, {{recently}} ennobled as Earl St Vincent, of a {{buildup of}} French forces around the Mediterranean seaport of Toulon under General Napoleon Bonaparte. Similar rumours had reached the Admiralty in London, and St Vincent therefore sent Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson and three ships of the line to observe French activity. Nelson arrived too late however, and the French fleet had already sailed, carrying over 30,000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean. Nelson, joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by St Vincent under Captain Thomas Troubridge, pursued the French, but failed <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>of</b> their destination before the French fleet captured Malta. Ten days later, Bonaparte sailed for Alexandria for {{the second stage of}} his operation and Nelson's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night, the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} learnability of several {{fundamental}} concept {{classes in the}} agnostic <b>learning</b> framework <b>of</b> Haussler [Hau 92] and Kearns et al. [KSS 94].

Together with the parity <b>learning</b> algorithm <b>of</b> Blum et al. [BKW 03], this gives the first nontrivial algorithm for agnostic <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> parities. We use similar techniques <b>to</b> reduce <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> two other fundamental concept classes under the uniform distribution <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> noisy parities.

After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.

5|$|Thus the consulship of Drusus was successful, {{but at the}} end of {{the year}} he fell ill.

He thought that he would be rewarded again, and so recited his elegy before an audience in preparation for Drusus' death. An unamused informer brought the matter before the Senate, and it was voted that he be executed. Hid execution was decreed and carried out without first consulting the emperor. This induced Tiberius to introduce a law where the Senate must wait 10 days after such condemnations before making such decrees public as to allow him <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>of</b> their decisions first.|$|E

Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>of</b> any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E

This is the cause of the island's Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, absorbing the contents of canisters and trying to claim Shaper powers as their own. The group have been unable to activate the Geneforge itself due to a Shaper being needed to activate the device.

Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell.
