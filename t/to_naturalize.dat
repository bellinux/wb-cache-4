5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E

25|$|Ghenadie held a de jure {{seat in the}} Senate of Romania, and was President of the Naturalization Commission, which mainly {{assessed}} requests made by non-emancipated Romanian Jews. He {{was thus}} involved in the controversy surrounding Lazăr Șăineanu (Lazare Sainéan), a Jewish scholar whose application was repeatedly rejected by the antisemitic lobby. Șăineanu {{was at the time}} still supported by his fellow linguist Hasdeu, and noted that the three of them spent a few days' vacation in Câmpina. Although the Ghenadie's Commission ruled in his favor (December 1893), the decision <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> Șăineanu was blocked out by National Liberal leaders such as Dimitrie Sturdza and V. A.

25|$|Tsarnaev {{was born}} in Kyrgyzstan. As a child, he emigrated {{with his family to}} Russia and then, when he was eight years old, to the United States under {{political}} asylum. The family settled in Cambridge and became U.S. permanent residents in March 2007. He became a U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012, while in college. His mother, Zubeidat, also became a U.S. citizen, {{but it is not clear}} if his father, Anzor, ever did. Tamerlan, his brother, was unable <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> expeditiously due to an investigation against him, which held up the citizenship process. At Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school, he was an avid wrestler, and a Greater Boston League winter all-star. He sometimes worked as a lifeguard at Harvard University.|$|E
25|$|A lawful {{permanent}} resident {{can apply for}} United States citizenship, or naturalization, {{after five years of}} residency. This period is shortened to three years if married to a U.S. citizen. Lawful {{permanent resident}}s may submit their applications for naturalization as early as 90 days before meeting the residency requirement. In the United States, 8.8 million lawful permanent residents are eligible <b>to</b> <b>naturalize.</b> Citizens are entitled to more rights (and obligations) than permanent residents (who are still classified as aliens in this respect). Lawful permanent residents generally do {{not have the right to}} vote, the right to be elected in federal and state elections (although even naturalized citizens cannot be elected President under Article II of the Constitution), the ability to bring family members to the United States (permanent residents are allowed to sponsor certain family members, but this is often not practical due to long approval delays), or eligibility for federal government jobs. Male permanent residents between the ages of 18 and 25 are subject to registering in the Selective Service System. Permanent residents who reside in the United States must pay taxes on their worldwide income (this includes filing annual U.S. income tax returns), like U.S. citizens.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig {{proved an}} enlightened {{patron of the}} arts and sciences, who {{transferred}} the University of Landshut to Munich, which, by his magnificent taste in building, he transformed {{into one of the most}} beautiful cities of the continent. The earlier years of his reign were marked by a liberal spirit and the reform, especially, of the financial administration; but the revolutions of 1830 frightened him into reaction, which was accentuated by the opposition of the parliament to his expenditure on building and works of art. In 1837, the Ultramontanes came into power with Karl von Abel (1788–1859) as prime minister. The Jesuits now gained the upper hand; one by one the liberal provisions of the constitution were modified or annulled; the Protestants were harried and oppressed; and a rigorous censorship forbade any free discussion of internal politics. The collapse of this régime was due, not to popular agitation, but to the resentment of Ludwig at the clerical opposition to the influence of his mistress, Lola Montez. On 17 February 1847, Abel was dismissed for publishing his memorandum against the proposal <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> Lola, who was an Irishwoman; and the Protestant Georg Ludwig von Maurer took his place. The new ministry granted the certificate of naturalisation; but riots, in which Ultramontane professors of the university took part, resulted. The professors were deprived, the parliament dissolved, and, on 27 November, the ministry dismissed. Lola Montez, created Countess Landsfeld, became supreme in the state; and the new minister, Prince Ludwig of Öttingen-Wallerstein (1791–1870), in spite of his efforts to enlist Liberal sympathy by appeals to pan-German patriotism, was powerless to form a stable government. His cabinet was known as the Lolaministerium; in February 1848, stimulated by the news from Paris (Revolution of 1848 in France), riots broke out against the countess; on 11 March the king dismissed Öttingen, and on 20 March, realizing the force of public opinion against him, abdicated in favour of his son, Maximilian II.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Salah Al Bandar, then {{an adviser}} to the Cabinet Affairs Ministry {{distributed}} a 240–page scandalous report, revealing an alleged Khawalid-led political conspiracy aiming to disenfranchise and marginalize the Shia majority, and to minimize the influence of [...] "reformers in the ruling family". One of the strategies of the alleged conspiracy was <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> Sunnis in order to re-shift the demographic balance. Other strategies included stroking sectarianism in the media, use of GONGOs and rigging the parliamentary election. The report named Ahmed bin Ateyatalla as head of the conspiracy by leading an [...] "underground network" [...] that aims [...] "to override the legal legitimacy, falsify popular will and vilify civil organizations". The latter was described as being an [...] "influential hardliner" [...] and a [...] "protégé" [...] of Khalid bin Ahmed.|$|E
500|$|Author Andrew Morton, in his {{biography}} on Madonna, {{commented that the}} video was America's first introduction to Madonna's sexual politics. Author Robert Clyde Allen in his book Channels of Discourse compared the video with that of [...] "Material Girl". According to him both the videos have an undermining ending, while employing a consistent series of puns and exhibiting a parodic amount of excess associated with Madonna's style. The discourses included in the video are those of sexuality and religion. Allen wrote that Madonna's image of kneeling and singing about 'burning in love' performed the traditional ideological work of using the subordination and powerlessness of women in Christianity <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> their equally submissive position in patriarchy. Author Georges-Claude Guilbert in his book Madonna as postmodern myth commented that {{the representation of the}} male character becomes irrelevant as Madonna destabilizes the fixing and categorization of male sexuality in the video. Her utterance of having [...] "no shame" [...] was interpreted by author James B. Twitchell, in his book For Shame, as an attempt to separate herself from contemporary female artists of that era.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a flurry}} of race hate {{messages}} sent <b>to</b> <b>naturalized</b> Bahrainis from developing countries after opposition political leaders alleged that immigration was tantamount to ‘cultural genocide’.

2500|$|The {{mention of}} the Tannins in the Genesis {{creation}} narrative (translated as [...] "great whales" [...] in the King James Version) and Leviathan in the Psalm do not describe them as harmful but as ocean creatures {{who are part of}} God's creation. The element of competition between God and the sea monster and the use of Leviathan to describe the powerful enemies of Israel may reflect the influence of the Mesopotamian and Canaanite legends or the contest in Egyptian mythology between the Apep snake and the sun god Horus. Alternatively, the removal of such competition may have reflected an attempt <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> Leviathan in a process that demoted it from deity to demon to monster.|$|E
2500|$|Under United States law {{during this}} period, {{particularly}} the Naturalization Act of 1790, only [...] "free white persons" [...] were eligible <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> as American citizens. Ineligibility for citizenship prevented Asian immigrants from accessing {{a variety of}} rights such as voting. In a pair of cases, Ozawa v. United States (1922) and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not [...] "white persons." [...] Second-generation Asian Americans, however, could become U.S. citizens due to the birthright citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898).|$|E

That is, the [...] "compromise solution" [...] that culture provided for Gramsci is not now one that pertains to the national level but to the local and transnational.

2500|$|In 1904, Grey {{became friends}} with a fellow Midwestern architect, Myron Hunt.

[...] Grey's health again failed {{during the early years of}} his partnership with Hunt, and he took a long trip to the South Sea Islands. [...] Yet, it was during his partnership with Hunt that Grey produced some of his finest work. [...] The two designed fine residences for the wealthy of Pasadena and also worked on larger projects, including schools, churches and hotels. [...] In 1905, The Architectural Record published articles on both Grey and Hunt, noting: [...] "Both Mr. Hunt and Mr. Grey stand for the attempt <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> in this country the best traditions of European architecture. [...] Mr. Grey, for instance, believes that a very genuine American style is in the process of making; but that as yet it is only in its infancy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 19th century saw {{the decline}} of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. [...] A small {{population}} of wealthy elite owned the farmlands in the country, and poor peasants found it difficult to survive. Koreans leaving the country in this period were obliged to move toward Russia, as the border with China was sealed by the Qing Dynasty. However, the first Koreans in the Russian Empire, 761 families totalling 5,310 people, had actually migrated to Qing territory; the land they had settled on was ceded to Russia by the Convention of Peking in 1860. Many peasants considered Siberia to be a land where they could lead better lives, and so they subsequently migrated there. As early as 1863, 13 Korean households were recorded near Novukorut Bay. These numbers rose dramatically, and by 1869 Koreans composed 20% {{of the population of the}} Maritime Province. Prior to the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway, Koreans outnumbered Russians in the Russian Far East; the local governors encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>naturalize.</b> The village of Blagoslovennoe was founded in 1870 by Korean migrants. The 1897 Russian Empire Census found 26,005 Korean speakers (16,225 men and 9,780 women) in the whole of Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Within the {{discipline}} of historical archaeology, specifically within the United States, landscape archaeology initially gained prominence with efforts to preserve the homes and gardens of prominent North American figures (see George Washington's Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello), the reconstruction of early colonial settlements (see Colonial Williamsburg) and the analysis of gardens (see Annapolis). Archaeologists studying the aforementioned, and other colonial sites throughout the United States, have excavated the gardens of wealthy {{men and women in}} order to reconstruct and ascertain the function of these gardens in colonial life. Scholars analyzing the colonial gardens have noticed that gardens were designed in a neat and orderly fashion, displaying symmetry and inspired by Baroque and Renaissance styles (this style is often described as indicative of a [...] "Georgian Worldview" [...] that became popular during the 17th and 18th centuries). Many interpretations have been advanced to explain the function of these gardens. Beginning in the mid-1700s, wealthy elites began to construct large, stately homes and neat, ordered gardens with the guise of mapping superiority and exclusive knowledge onto the landscape. [...] Although the Baroque and Renaissance styles were out of date by the time elites in the United States employed them, this was intentionally done to communicate a knowledge and appreciation of British history that few within the community would have access to. [...] Archaeologists have concluded that the symmetrical, geometric, designs of garden-scapes adopted by colonists in the mid eighteenth to nineteenth centuries made use of [...] "...converging and diverging lines of sight to manipulate the relationship between distance and focal point", making objects appear larger or further away than they really were. [...] These optical illusions functioned to transform the home into a readily identifiable status symbol, and to mark the owners and occupants of these homes as socially distinct from others within the colonial community. [...] Stately homes and gardens constructed by the colonial elite also served to assert authority and <b>to</b> <b>naturalize</b> a social hierarchy onto the colonial landscape. [...] Such analysis and interpretations are neo-marxist in its approach to the understanding and interpreting landscapes of the past.|$|E
