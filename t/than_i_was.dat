500|$|Jenner was a {{successful}} race car driver in the IMSA Camel GT series (International Motor Sports Association) in the 1980s. Jenner's first victory came in the 1986 12 hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTO class driving the 7-Eleven Roush Racing Ford Mustang with co-driver Scott Pruett. The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner's career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett. Jenner commented, [...] "I {{was a lot more}} badass runner <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a driver." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{young couple}} was given Rosneath {{by his father}} {{at the time of}} their marriage. Deeply religious, Elizabeth had been raised in the Anglican faith but {{converted}} to the Church of Scotland upon her marriage, taking her first communion in the faith later that year. Like many of her predecessors, Elizabeth was a strong supporter of the Scottish Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles. The couple possessed similar interest in liberal politics. Elizabeth was dignified and cultured, and Lorne found in his new wife [...] "more than all that had been told me by her numerous friends... On some subjects, excepting philosophy and the natural sciences, she was more widely read <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the time." ...|$|E

[...] He also accused the Egyptian authorities of establishing a system of rule dependent on [...] "1,001 spies" [...] and responsible for sowing division in the republic. Quwatli told the Syrian people they controlled their own destiny, saying [...] "Ranks and titles come and go, but you the people are immortal!" [...] He concluded his speech with self-criticism, stating [...] "I was able to serve your struggle as an ordinary citizen more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to serve you when I was president." ...|$|E

500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Terai Engineering {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} J2X-C at the 500 km of Suzuka in April 1992, but the car was far from ready, and did not attend. The J2X-C was first tested on 9 July 1992, with Costas Los selected to drive it at Pembrey Circuit. He said of the car; [...] "the J2X felt very different to a regular Group C car... Contrary to most Group C cars I had driven, {{it was a lot}} more tuneable <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> accustomed to." [...] However, he did state that the car's lack of power-assisted steering was a problem. The team struggled to find a buyer for the car, as the Group C era was drawing to a close by 1992 and 1993; the IMSA GTP Championship was on its last legs, and the World Sportscar Championship was beginning to shift away from the category.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December, the United States House of Representatives voted by 402 to 1 {{to congratulate}} Liu and honour his [...] "promotion of {{democratic}} reform in China, {{and the courage}} with which he has borne repeated imprisonment... and [...] on the government of China to cease censoring media and internet reporting of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo and to cease its campaign of defamation against Liu Xiaobo." [...] The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded by accusing US lawmakers of possessing an [...] "arrogant and unreasonable attitude" [...] and [...] "lacking respect for China's judicial sovereignty." [...] Ahead of the award ceremony, Barack Obama said [...] "Mr Liu Xiaobo is far more deserving of this award <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was...</b> reminds us that human dignity also depends upon the advance of democracy, open society, {{and the rule of}} law...

500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 months or so. He then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more people, I know so much more about the world, and I'm so much more relaxed <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> three or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{attended}} The Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills. He {{decided to}} become an actor after performing in a school play {{at the age of}} 16, becoming, at the expense of his academic studies, [...] "obsessed with acting." [...] Both of his parents loved all forms of show business, which further spurred him to become an actor. He studied drama at Tufts University from 1981 to 1985, where he met and befriended actor Oliver Platt and noted that [...] "Oliver was a better actor <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in college, and he really inspired me." [...] Together they both starred in various college stage productions, including The Merchant of Venice, before Azaria trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Although he did not expect the endeavor to be successful, Azaria {{decided to become}} a professional actor, so that later in his life, he would not regret not having tried. Azaria's first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was seventeen years old. He also worked as a busboy. Azaria originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor, and he and Platt set up their own company, named Big Theatre, although Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter was the only thing they ever performed. He decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity so, after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold, Azaria moved to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E
