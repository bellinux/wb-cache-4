Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. <b>They</b> <b>cite</b> reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, {{claim that}} some ex-Nazis, {{who survived the}} fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by {{organizations}} like ODESSA and Die Spinne, have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, corporatism, the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. <b>They</b> <b>cite</b> the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} no-till and related methods are {{impractical}} and {{too expensive for}} many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. <b>They</b> <b>cite</b> advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions.

25|$|Afrocentrists {{hold that}} Africans exhibit {{a range of}} types and {{physical}} characteristics, and that such elements as wavy hair or aquiline facial features {{are part of a}} continuum of African types that do not depend on admixture with Caucasian groups. <b>They</b> <b>cite</b> work by Hiernaux and Hassan that they believe demonstrates that populations could vary based on micro-evolutionary principles (climate adaptation, drift, selection), and that such variations existed in both living and fossil Africans.|$|E
25|$|Airport {{officials}} and city leaders say {{the merger of}} MCI's three terminals into one terminal is inevitable. <b>They</b> <b>cite</b> the expense of operating several security checkpoints within each terminal {{and the lack of}} concessions and retail space beyond security, as well as the operating costs of the airport itself as reasons for a new terminal.

The EFF also makes the argument that all the side effects of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act are negative for all parties except media companies. Therefore, it only helps the big media companies.|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. <b>They</b> <b>cite</b> the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells as small as a sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E
25|$|This {{particular}} {{model used}} an Out of Africa migration 100,000 years ago, which separated Africans from non-Africans, {{followed by a}} single admixture event 30,000 years ago leading to the formulation of the European population. The admixture event consisted of a source population that was 35% African and 65% East Asian. However, the study notes that a more realistic scenario would include several admixture events occurring over a sustained period. In particular, <b>they</b> <b>cite</b> the spread of farming from a source population in West Asia 5000–9000 years ago that {{may have played a}} role in the genetic relatedness of Africans and Europeans, since West Asia is sandwiched in between Africa and Central Asia.|$|E
