5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> the Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report.

5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|In late 1953, the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War.

5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> the Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but {{did not result in}} any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football.|$|E

5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital. Taylor, recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence, ordered the men home, {{and many of them}} complied. Still, two or three hundred remained, awaiting the election committee's findings. Others remained as witnesses set to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> the contest committee. Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by local police, who were mostly Goebel partisans. Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them, citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest. To avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, many of the Republican partisans began wearing their guns openly, adding to the tensions in the city, but effectively reducing the number of arrests by local police.|$|E
5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1961, {{differences}} in monetary policy led to open conflict with Bank of Canada Governor Coyne, who adhered to a tight money policy. Appointed by St. Laurent to a term expiring in December 1961, Coyne {{could only be}} dismissed before then by the passing of an Act of Parliament. Coyne defended his position by giving public speeches, {{to the dismay of}} the government. The Cabinet was also angered when it learned that Coyne and his board had passed amendments to the bank's pension scheme which greatly increased Coyne's pension, without publishing the amendments in the Canada Gazette as required by law. Negotiations between Minister of Finance Fleming and Coyne for the latter's resignation broke down, with the governor making the dispute public, and Diefenbaker sought to dismiss Coyne by legislation. Diefenbaker was able to get legislation to dismiss Coyne through the House, but the Liberal-controlled Senate invited Coyne to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> one of its committees. After giving the governor a platform against the government, the committee then chose to take no further action, adding its view that Coyne had done nothing wrong. Once he had the opportunity to testify (denied him in the Commons), Coyne resigned, keeping his increased pension, and the government was extensively criticized in the press.|$|E

5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used by}} the officials of various governments. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the United Nations. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few Republican controlled Congresses in many years. Republicans thus sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to erode the voting base of the Democratic party. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held a number of hearings, purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory {{documents were}} used in this process, and Carlos Castillo Armas became the first head of state to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> a US Congress committee (although he did so {{through the use of}} a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they did provide Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix. Sitting across the table were W. S. Van Dyke, Howard Hawks, and Briskin's friend, Frank Capra. In 1939, Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> the National Labor Relations Board, regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to <b>testify</b> <b>before</b> the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E
