40|$|Abstract During virus assembly, all retroviruses {{specifically}} encapsidate {{two copies}} of full-length viral genomic RNA {{in the form of}} a non-covalently linked RNA dimer. The absolute conservation of this unique genome structure within the Retroviridae family is strong evidence that a dimerized genome is of critical importance to the viral life cycle. An obvious hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> evolved to preferentially package {{two copies of}} genomic RNA, and that dimerization ensures the proper packaging specificity for such a genome. However, this implies that dimerization must be a prerequisite for genome encapsidation, a notion that has been debated for many years. In this article, we review retroviral RNA dimerization and packaging, highlighting the research that has attempted to dissect the intricate relationship between these two processes in the context of HIV- 1, and discuss the therapeutic potential of these putative antiretroviral targets. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conciliating {{biosafety}} with efficient {{gene transfer}} remains a constant {{concern in the}} development of retroviral vectors. Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicons allow important retroviral vector production with interesting features. It is noteworthy <b>that</b> <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> the ability to package Ψ+ and, to some extent, Ψ− cellular RNAs. Therefore, it was important to study the retroviral transfer of highly abundant SFV genomes expressing retroviral proteins. Here, we show that full-length SFV-vector replicons, with or without Ψ, are efficiently packaged into retrovirus particles. Mechanistically, our data suggest that SFV packaging is the sum of its retroviral nucleocapsid-dependent recruitment together with a passive hijacking of membrane-anchored SFV replicon. A direct consequence of this phenomenon is the formation of particles harboring autonomous replicative abilities and contaminating vector preparations. Importantly, we confirm that retroviral SFV mobilization is not an exclusive feature of murine gamma retroviruses, since it is also observed using lentivectors...|$|R
40|$|The tropism of retroviruses {{relies on}} their ability to exploit {{cellular}} factors for their replication as well as to avoid host-encoded inhibitory activities such as TRIM 5 α. N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) is sensitive to human TRIM 5 α restriction, whereas human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) escapes this antiviral factor. We showed previously that mutation of four critical amino acid residues within the capsid (CA) can render MLV resistant to huTRIM 5 α. Here, we exploit the high degree of conservation in the tertiary structure of retroviral capsids to map the corresponding positions on the HIV 1 capsid. We then demonstrate that, by introducing changes at some of these positions, HIV 1 becomes sensitive to huTRIM 5 α restriction, a phenomenon reinforced by additionally mutating the nearby cyclophilin A (CypA) -binding loop of the viral protein. These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> evolved similar mechanisms to escape TRIM 5 α restriction, via the interference of structurally homologous determinants in the viral capsid...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we found avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) gag genes in 19 {{species of birds}} in the order Galliformes including all grouse and ptarmigan (Tetraoninae) surveyed. Our data suggested <b>that</b> <b>retroviruses</b> <b>had</b> been transmitted horizontally among some host species. To further investigate these elements, we sequenced a replication-defective retrovirus, here named tetraonine endogenous retrovirus (TERV), from Bonasa umbellus (ruffed grouse). This is the first report of a complete, replication-defective ASLV provirus sequence from any bird other than the domestic chicken. We found a replication-defective proviral sequence consisting of putative Gag and Env proteins flanked by long terminal repeats. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that retroviral gag sequences closely related to TERV are transcribed, supporting the hypothesis that TERV is an active endogenous retrovirus. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that TERV may have arisen via recombination between different retroviral lineages infecting birds. Southern blotting using gag probes showed that TERV occurs in tetraonines but not in chickens or ducks, suggesting that integration occurred after the earliest phasianid divergences but prior to the radiation of tetraonine birds...|$|R
50|$|LTR retrotransposons {{have direct}} LTRs {{that range from}} ~100 bp to over 5 kb in size. LTR retrotransposons are further sub-classified into the Ty1-copia-like (Pseudoviridae), Ty3-gypsy-like (Metaviridae), and BEL-Pao-like groups based on both their degree of {{sequence}} similarity and the order of encoded gene products. Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy groups of retrotransposons are commonly found in high copy number (up to a few million copies per haploid nucleus) in animals, fungi, protista, and plants genomes. BEL-Pao like elements have so far only been found in animals. Although retroviruses are often classified separately, they share many features with LTR retrotransposons. A major difference with Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy retrotransposons is <b>that</b> <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> an Envelope protein (ENV). A retrovirus can be transformed into an LTR retrotransposon through inactivation or deletion of the domains that enable extracellular mobility. If such a retrovirus infects and subsequently inserts itself in the genome in germ line cells, it may become transmitted vertically and become an Endogenous Retrovirus (ERV). Endogenous retroviruses make up about 8% {{of the human genome}} and approximately 10% of the mouse genome.|$|R

We have {{determined}} {{whether and how}} the cytoplasmic domains of oncoretrovirus glycoproteins modulate their intracellular trafficking, by using chimeric proteins that combined the α-chain of the interleukin- 2 receptor with the glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains of five oncoretroviruses: human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). All of these proteins were synthesized and matured {{in the same way}} as a control protein with no retrovirus cytoplasmic domain. However, the amounts of all chimeric proteins at the cell surface were smaller than that of the control protein. The protein appearing at and leaving the cell surface and endocytosis were measured in stable transfectants expressing the chimera. We identified two groups of proteins which followed distinct intracellular pathways. Group 1 included chimeric proteins that reached the cell surface normally but were rapidly endocytosed afterwards. This group included the chimeric proteins with HTLV- 1, RSV, and BLV cytoplasmic domains. Group 2 included chimeric proteins that were not detected at the cell surface, despite normal intracellular concentrations, and were accumulated in the Golgi complex. This group included the chimeric proteins with MuLV and MPMV cytoplasmic domains. Finally, we verified that the MuLV envelope glycoproteins behaved {{in the same way as}} the corresponding chimeras. These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> evolved two distinct mechanisms to ensure a similar biological feature: low concentrations of their glycoproteins at the cell surface...|$|R

In an effort to address {{the extent to which}} these viruses have identical genetic information or there is divergence in their genomic sequences, we have compared the nine retrovirus isolates by the following criteria: (i) antigenic cross-reactivity by highly specific and sensitive competition radioimmunoassay for the major internal antigen; (ii) restriction site mapping analysis; and (iii) immunoblot analysis and metabolic labeling of viral structural proteins and their analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The data indicate <b>that</b> individual <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> significant restriction site polymorphism in their genome even though they were isolated from patients residing at one geographic location.

40|$|Receptor {{recognition}} by avian retroviruses {{is thought to}} involve the interaction of two regions of the SU protein, hr 1 and hr 2, with the host cell surface receptor. These regions exhibit considerable variation, concordant with differences in receptor usage among the many avian leukosis virus subgroups. We hypothesize <b>that</b> some <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> altered receptor usage in response to selective pressures imposed by receptor polymorphisms in their hosts. To test this hypothesis, we passaged td-Pr-RSV-B on cocultured permissive chicken (C/E) and nonpermissive quail (QT 6 /BD) cells. A variant virus with an expanded host range was identified at passage 29 and ultimately shown to be identical in sequence to td-Pr-RSV-B, except for changes at codons 155 and 156 of SU amino acid corresponding to two amino acid changes within hr 1. Superinfection resistance {{studies suggest that the}} variant virus recognizes the subgroup B receptor on chicken cells and the subgroup E receptor on quail cells. These findings indicate that altered receptor usage can be conferred by small changes in env and may point to a key region for receptor interaction. Further, they demonstrate the evolutionary potential of retroviral env genes to alter receptor usage in response to appropriate selective pressure...|$|R

We here report that markers in two TRIMs, TRIM 5 and TRIM 22 and a marker in BST 2, associated statistically with the risk of getting MS, while markers in or near APOBEC 3 s and TREXs showed little or no effect.

40|$|To {{identify}} genes {{involved in}} etoposide drug response, we used promoter trap mutagenesis to isolate an etoposide-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. This resistant CHO-K 1 line, named E 91, showed cross-resistance to C 2 -ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine). The promoter trap retrovirus was found integrated into intron 1 – 2 of the Dlc- 2 (Stard 13) RhoGap gene. The E 91 cells showed elevated guanosine triphosphate (GTP) -bound RhoA levels {{compared with the}} parental line, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>retrovirus</b> integration <b>had</b> inactivated one of the Dlc- 2 RhoGap alleles. To test whether E 91 cells were impaired in an intracellular ceramide-regulated process {{not directly related to}} cell killing, we measured mitochondrial phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) synthase and phospholipase A 2 enzyme activities in cells after C 2 -ceramide addition. Parental cells showed elevated enzyme activities after treatment with C 2 -ceramide or tumor necrosis factor α, but not the E 91 cells. These results suggested that intracellular ceramide signaling was defective in E 91 cells due to increased levels of active GTP-bound RhoA. RNA knockdown experiments of the Dlc 2 RhoGap resulted in increased GTP-bound RhoA and reduced induction of PGP synthase after C 2 -ceramide addition compared with controls. Expression of a dominant-negative RhoA in the E 91 cell line allowed induction of PGP synthase by ceramide. The RNA interference knockdown cell line also showed increased etoposide resistance.

In our study, the transduction of helper-free pseudotyped retrovirus, which showed a broad host range, in human hepatoma cells was performed under 2 conditions, that is, in the presence of polymerized human serum albumin (pHSA) and in the absence of pHSA. The transduction ability in the presence of pHSA was higher than in the absence of pHSA. Moreover, HBsAg and HBeAg levels after transductions with pHSA were significantly lower than those in the absence of pHSA, thus indicating <b>that</b> the recombinant <b>retrovirus</b> <b>had</b> HBV-specific cleavage activity and targeted HepG 2215 cells.

40|$|It is {{now known}} <b>that</b> all human <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> a {{non-human}} primate counterpart. It {{has been reported that}} the presence of these retroviruses in humans is the result of interspecies transmission. Several authors have described the passage of a simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from primates to humans. To better understand this retroviral “zoonosis” in natural settings, we evaluated the presence of SFV in both captive and wild non-human primates and in humans at high risk, such as hunters and people bitten by a non-human primate, in Gabon, central Africa. A high prevalence of SFV was found in blood samples from non-human primates and in bush meat collected across the country. Mandrills were found to be highly infected with two distinct strains of SFV, depending on their geographical location. Furthermore, samples collected from hunters and non-human primate laboratory workers showed clear, extensive cross-species transmission of SFV. People who had been bitten by mandrills, gorillas and chimpanzees had persistent SFV infection with low genetic drift. Thus, SFV is presumed to be transmitted from non-human primates mainly through severe bites, involving contact between infected saliva and blood.

40|$|Integration of {{retroviral}} cDNA {{into the}} host cell genome {{is a process}} central to the replication cycle of retroviruses and is mediated by the virally-encoded integrase protein. While any DNA sequence can be a target for integration, retroviruses do not integrate randomly into the host cell chromosomes. Recent studies <b>have</b> found <b>that</b> different <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> distinct target site selection preferences for various genomic features. We have sequenced integration sites from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV) and three HIV-MLV chimeras and determined that both integrase and the viral Gag proteins act together to determine virus-specific integration site selection preferences. Once integrated, the provirus is transcribed by the host cell machinery into messenger RNA and the viral RNA genome. A number of factors are thought {{to contribute to the}} level of proviral gene expression. For HIV, these include the activation state of the host cell, CpG methylation, nucleosome organization, and mutations in the viral transactivator, tat, or transcription factor binding sites in the viral promoter and enhancer. Factors that negatively influence HIV gene expression are of interest because of the phenomenon of viral latency, where HIV persists in the genome of host cells undetected {{due to a lack of}} expression. We set out to determine the extent to which integration site influences expression of the HIV provirus. In this study, we infected Jurkat T cells with an HIV-based vector transducing GFP and separated cells into GFP-expressing and non-expressing populations. We then sequenced integration sites from these two populations. Low proviral expression correlated with integration into (1) gene deserts, (2) centromeric heterochromatin, and (3) very highly expressed host cell genes.

Here we generated nonintegrating foamy virus (NIFV) vectors by introducing point mutations into the highly conserved DD 35 E catalytic core motif of the foamy virus integrase sequence. NIFV vectors produced high-titer stocks, transduced dividing cells, {{and did not}} integrate. Cells infected with NIFV vectors contained episomal vector genomes that consisted of linear, 1 -long-terminal-repeat (1 -LTR), and 2 -LTR circular DNAs. These episomes expressed transgenes, were stable, and became progressively diluted in the dividing cell population. 1 -LTR circles but not 2 -LTR circles were found in all vector stocks prior to infection. Residual integration of NIFV vectors occurred at a frequency 4 logs {{lower than that of}} integrase-proficient FV vectors. Cre recombinase expressed from a NIFV vector mediated excision of both an integrated, floxed FV vector and a gene-targeted neo expression cassette, demonstrating the utility of these episomal vectors. The broad host range and large packaging capacity of NIFV vectors should make them useful for a variety of applications requiring transient gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Retroelements {{constitute}} {{a large portion}} of our genomes. One class of these elements, the human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), is comprised of remnants of ancient exogenous <b>retroviruses</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> gained access to the germ line. After integration, most proviruses {{have been the subject of}} numerous amplifications and have suffered extensive deletions and mutations. Nevertheless, HERV-derived transcripts and proteins have been detected in healthy and diseased human tissues, and HERV-K, the youngest, most conserved family, is able to form virus-like particles. Although it is generally accepted that the integration of retroelements can cause significant harm by disrupting or disregulating essential genes, the role of HERV expression in the etiology of malignancies and autoimmune and neurologic diseases remains controversial. In recent years, striking evidence has accumulated indicating that some proviral sequences and HERV proteins might even serve the needs of the host and are therefore under positive selection. The remarkable progress in the analysis of host genomes has brought to light the significant impact of HERVs and other retroelements on genetic variation, genome evolution, and gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|Both Mill Hill 2 and E 26 <b>retroviruses</b> <b>have</b> transduced two {{cellular}} genes [...] c-myc and c-mil/mht (Mill Hill 2) and c-myb and c-ets (E 26). We localized {{the genes}} transduced by these viruses to different chromosomes: c-myc and c-myb to relatively large chromosomes and c-mil/mht and c-ets to microchromosomes. Thus, like avian erythroblastosis virus, {{each of these}} <b>retroviruses</b> <b>has</b> transduced two cellular genes unlinked in the chicken genome...|$|R
