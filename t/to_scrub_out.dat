60|$|I {{was anxious}} {{to see what was}} {{happening}} in the town and what people were talking of; but I thought it prudent not to venture out, for my disguise might be seen through, and if I were discovered I knew well what to expect. So I sat at home twiddling my thumbs and chattering with Andrea. At last, getting tired of doing nothing, and seeing the good woman about <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> her courtyard, I volunteered to do it for her. I got a broom and a pail of water and began sweeping away vigorously, while Andrea stood in the doorway scoffing. For a little while I forgot the terrible scene in the piazza.|$|E

50|$|Smoking pipe {{cleaners}} normally {{use some}} absorbent material, usually cotton or sometimes viscose. Bristles of stiffer material, normally monofilament nylon or polypropylene are sometimes added <b>to</b> better <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> {{what is being}} cleaned. Microfilament polyester is used in some technical pipe cleaners because polyester wicks liquid away rather than absorbing it as cotton does. Some smoking pipe cleaners are made conical or tapered so that one end is thick and one end thin. The thin end is for cleaning the small bore of the pipe stem and then the thick end for the bowl or the wider part of the stem. When used for cleaning purposes, pipe cleaners are normally discarded after one or two uses.|$|R
50|$|The kiln {{connects with}} a {{material}} exit hood {{at the lower}} end and to ducts for waste gases. This requires gas-tight seals {{at either end of the}} kiln. The exhaust gas may go to waste, or may enter a preheater which further exchanges heat with the entering feed. The gases must be drawn through the kiln, and the preheater if fitted, by a fan situated at the exhaust end. In preheater installations which may have a high pressure-drop, a lot of fan power may be needed, and the fan is often then largest drive in the kiln system. Exhaust gases contain dust and there may be undesirable constituents such as sulfur dioxide or hydrogen chloride. Equipment is installed <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> these <b>out</b> before the exhaust gases pass to atmosphere.|$|R

The Surgeon brought corporate contractors into the Garden of Ancestral Memory, who murdered the entities living there and later supervised {{the creation of a}} corporate religion called [...] "Religimon". The Surgeon was later killed by Midnighter and Jeroen instantly recovered his powers.|$|E
50|$|The United States Department of Homeland Security {{initially}} {{supported the}} bill, with Jeh Johnson, {{the secretary of}} the DHS, calling for the bill to move forward on September 15. However, in an August 3 letter to senator Al Franken (D-MN), the deputy secretary of the DHS, Alejandro Mayorkas, expressed a desire to have all connections be brokered by the DHS, given the Department's charter to protect the executive branch networks. In the letter, the DHS found issue with the direct sharing of information with all government agencies, advocating instead that the DHS be the sole recipient of cyberthreat information, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> private information. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has published a Privacy Impact Assessment detailing its internal review of the proposed system for handling incoming indicators from Industry.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the article}} by Curbed New York, she also cites the {{formation}} of the Prospect Park Alliance and its successful efforts at cleaning up the park and the surrounding area as a tipping point for Brooklyn's gentrification. [...] "Nobody wants to be chased up five flights of stairs screaming, 'Open the door' because you're about to be jumped. but why can't there be some kind of common ground that respects the elderly and longtime residents that do not have the wherewithal or desire to relocate? How is it right to tell a family, 'Well now that the neighborhood's safer, and the park is clean and the schools are better, you don't get to live here anymore.'" [...] In her observations of this transformation, Carlo questions the motives of those who led the effort to make this area [...] "the beautiful oasis it is today." [...] In cleaning up the area surrounding Prospect Park, did such groups also hope <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> long-time residents and racial minorities, as well as the unique culture they had created? Overall, reflections on the past in There Goes the Neighborhood and Carlo's other works provide more than just moments of nostalgia for New York natives. They chronicle the evolution of an entire city, and how these changes affect entire groups of people and the Latinx community as a whole.|$|E
50|$|A B-double (B-train) {{consists}} of a prime mover towing a specialised lead trailer that has a fifth-wheel mounted on the rear towing another semi-trailer, resulting in two articulation points. Around container ports in Australia there may also have {{what is known as}} a super B-double, i.e. a B-double with a quad axle lead trailer capable of holding one 40-foot shipping container or two 20-foot shipping containers, and the rear trailer being capable of the same with either a tri or quad rear axle set. However, because of their length and low accessibility into narrow streets, these vehicles are restricted in where they can go and are generally used for terminal-to-terminal work, i.e. wharf to container holding park or wharf-to-wharf. The rear axle on each trailer can also pivot slightly while turning <b>to</b> prevent <b>scrubbing</b> <b>out</b> the edges of the tyres due to the heavy loads placed on them.|$|R

50|$|The {{show was}} put into {{syndication}} in September 2007, to be offered by local television stations on a weekday basis in the United States by Litton Entertainment. However, the Litton versions of the program were severely edited and changed. Any references <b>to</b> MTV were <b>scrubbed</b> <b>out,</b> and the program received a new logo referring to it as just Cribs, while all music that was played in the original episodes was replaced by production music to avoid royalty fees. Although Lewis and Pak were still listed in the episode credits as narrators, all narration was stripped in the re-edited episodes, and 'coming up' segments were either silent or voiced by an uncredited announcer. The syndicated version was unsuccessful and offered in barter form, mainly on the lower-rated stations in many markets in abysmal timeslots, and was removed in September 2008 from the market.|$|R
50|$|The bullet must tightly fit {{the bore}} {{to seal the}} high {{pressure}} of the burning gunpowder. This tight fit results in a large frictional force. The friction of the bullet in the bore does have a slight impact on the final velocity, but that is generally {{not much of a}} concern. Of greater concern is the heat that is generated due to the friction. At velocities of about 300 m/s, lead begins to melt, and deposit in the bore. This lead build-up constricts the bore, increasing the pressure and decreasing the accuracy of subsequent rounds, and is difficult <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> without damaging the bore. Rounds, used at velocities up to 460 m/s, can use wax lubricants on the bullet to reduce lead build-up. At velocities over 460 m/s, nearly all bullets are jacketed in copper, or a similar alloy that is soft enough not to wear on the barrel, but melts at a high enough temperature to reduce build-up in the bore. Copper build-up does begin to occur in rounds that exceed 760 m/s, and a common solution is to impregnate the surface of the bullet with molybdenum disulfide lubricant. This reduces copper build-up in the bore, and results in better long-term accuracy. Large caliber projectiles also employ copper driving bands for rifled barrels for spin-stabilized projectiles; however, fin-stabilized projectiles fired from both rifle and smoothbore barrels, such as the APFSDS anti-armor projectiles, employ nylon obturation rings that are sufficient to seal high pressure propellant gasses and also minimize in-bore friction, providing a small boost to muzzle velocity.|$|E
40|$|Amultifaceted {{approach}} to condenser design was applied tothe Gilroy Foods Cogeneration Plant {{in order to}} optimize oxygen control. This unique design incorporated the following components: • A vacuum deaerator to remove noncondensible gases from the makeup water. The deaerator {{is connected to the}} con-denser through steam piping and a return line to the hotwell • A segregated condensate reheat hotwell to further deaerate the water from both the condenser and the vacuum deaera-tor. Steam injected into the hotwell reheats the condensate and acts <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> any reabsorbed gases; • An enhanced venting system ensuring that whatever noncon-densible gases are released will be removed and which maintains a low air partial pressure within the condenser...|$|E
40|$|At {{space vehicle}} launch {{sites such as}} Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), toxic vapors and {{hazardous}} liquid wastes result from the handling of commodities (hypergolic fuels and oxidizers), most notably from transfer operations where fuel and oxidizer are transferred from bulk storage tanks or transfer tankers to space launch vehicles. During commodity transfer at CCAFS and KSC, wet chemical scrubbers (typically containing four scrubbing towers) are used to neutralize fuel saturated vapors from vent systems on tanks and tanker trailers. For fuel vapors, a citric acid solution is used <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>out</b> most of the hydrazine. Operation of both the hypergolic fuel and oxidizer vapor scrubbers generates waste scrubber liquor. Currently, scrubber liquor from the fuel vapor scrubber is considered non-hazardous. The scrubber liquor is defined as spent citric acid scrubber solution; the solution contains complexed hydrazine I methylhydrazine and is used to neutralize nonspecification hypergolic fuel generated by CCAFS and KSC. This project is a collaborative effort between Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Space and Missile Center (SMC), the CCAFS, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to evaluate microwave destruction technology {{for the treatment of}} non-specification hypergolic fuel generated at CCAFS and KSC. The project will capitalize on knowledge gained from microwave treatment work being accomplished by AFSPC and SMC at V AFB. This report focuses on the costs associated with the current non-specification hypergolic fuel neutralization process (Section 2. 0) as well as the estimated costs of operating a mobile microwave unit to treat non-specification hypergolic fuel (Section 3. 0), and compares the costs for each (Section 4. 0). The purpose of this document is to assess the costs associated with waste hypergolic fuel. This document will report the costs associated with the current fuel neutralization process and also examine the costs of an alternative technology, microwave destruction of waste hypergolic fuel. The microwave destruction system is being designed as a mobile unit to treat non-specification hypergolic fuel at CCAFS and KSC...|$|E
30|$|Total {{organic carbon}} (TOC) {{includes}} biodegradable sugars, protein, and fat {{content of a}} material but does not include inorganic carbonate fractions such as calcium and magnesium carbonates. The TOC of milk dust powder was measured {{in accordance with the}} TMECC method 04.01 -A (2002), using a carbon analyzer (Model Vario MAX CN, Elementar Americas). Samples were briefly subjected to combustion in an oxygen-rich atmosphere in a resistance furnace at 1, 370 °C. The CO 2 produced was passed through an oxygen stream in anhydrone tubes <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> water vapor <b>out</b> of the stream. The dehydrated CO 2 stream was then channeled into an infrared detector, which generates a signal proportionate to the amount of CO 2 detected. The resulting values are reported as percentage of TOC content (dry wt., w/w) in dried samples.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} an original robot architecture for in-pipe inspection. The robot {{consists of two}} parts articulated with a universal joint. One part is guided along the pipe {{by a set of}} wheels moving parallel to the axis of the pipe, while the other part is forced to follow an helical motion thanks to tilted wheels rotating about the axis of the pipe. A single motor is placed between the two bodies to produce the motion. All the wheels are mounted on a suspension to accommodate for changing tube diameter and curves in the pipe. The robot is autonomous and carries its own batteries and radio link. Four different prototypes have been constructed for pipe diameters of 170, 70 and 40 mm, respectively. For smaller diameters, the batteries and the radio receiver may be placed on an additional body attached to the others. The autonomy of the prototypes is about 2 hours. This architecture is very simple and the rotary motion can be exploited <b>to</b> carry <b>out</b> <b>scrubbing</b> or inspection tasks...|$|R
