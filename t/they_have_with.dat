25|$|In short, {{identity}} fusion theory {{posits that}} fused people project feelings of relational ties <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> known group members onto unknown group members. The projection of relational ties explains why fused individuals are sometimes {{willing to make}} sacrifices for members of large heterogeneous groups {{that most people would}} make only for small, tight-knit groups. Through the process of projection, they psychologically transform genetically unrelated individuals into kin.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} with A-T develop deformities {{of the feet}} that compound the difficulty <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> walking due to impaired coordination. Early treatment may slow progression of this deformity. Bracing or surgical correction sometimes improves stability at the ankle sufficient to enable an individual to walk with support, or bear weight during assisted standing transfers from one seat to another. Severe scoliosis is relatively uncommon, but probably does occur more often than in those without A-T. Spinal fusion is only rarely indicated.|$|E

25|$|However {{the power}} that a prime {{minister}} has over his or her cabinet colleagues is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} support that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Also when a party is divided into factions a Prime Minister may be forced to include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The Prime Minister's personal power is also curtailed if their party is in a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).|$|E
25|$|Sex is a {{basic form}} of {{communication}} in bonobos’ life. It seems to infuse everything from simple expressions of affection {{to the establishment of}} dominance. Female bonobos have been observed to engage in sexual activities to create bonds with dominant bonobos. Having created this bond with the male, they will share food with each other and not compete with each other. All members of the group are potential sex partners, males participate in sexual activity with other males, as do females with other females. These bonds made between females are for protection against male bonobos. If a male bonobo attempts to harass a female bonobo, the other females will help the female defend herself because of the strong bonds <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> each other.|$|E

They are entitled to live in Ireland without any restrictions or conditions. <b>They</b> <b>have,</b> <b>with</b> limited exceptions, never been treated as foreigners under Irish law, having never been subject to the Aliens Act 1935 or to any orders made under that Act. British citizens can thus move to Ireland to live, work or retire and unlike other EU citizens, they are not required to demonstrate having sufficient resources or have private health insurance in order to retire. This is due to the fact that British citizens are also entitled to use Irish public services on the same basis as Irish citizens in Ireland.|$|E

500|$|The novel's {{tone and}} {{structure}} place {{it within the}} serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming. For example, the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S. Byatt's Possession (1990) and the intermingling of academia and the occult suggests Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas (1993). Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code (2003), Kostova has said her book [...] "is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action...the only overlap is this idea of people searching for something in history. I'm still surprised when people make this comparison, I'm very grateful my publisher has never pushed it." [...] Moreover, the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad Țepeș and she changed the name of some locations [...] "fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Brown's novels".|$|E
500|$|Samus {{has been}} well {{received}} by the video game community. In 2001, IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters. She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website's users, the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie, especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates. Among their list of voted characters, IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that [...] "could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage {{to live up to}} the source material." [...] Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs [...] "Character Battle" [...] contests, winning the [...] "Character Battle V" [...] in 2006. In 2009, GameSpot featured her in their poll [...] "All-Time Greatest Game Hero", in which she lost to Mario in the semi-finals. Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity. The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the character is by being her through gameplay, while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, [...] "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," [...] referring to the revelation that she is a woman. MMA and actress Ronda Rousey told GameSpot in a 2016 interview that she [...] "always wanted to be Samus" [...] if a live-action Metroid film is made.|$|E

500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E

The researcher believed that the way clinical examinations were conducted influenced how a child’s inner realities surfaced. Children would likely respond according to the way the research is conducted, the questions asked, or the familiarity <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the environment. The clinical examination conducted for his third book provides a thorough investigation into a child’s thinking process. An example of a question used to research such process was: [...] "Can you see a thought?" [...] (Mayer, 2005, p.372).|$|E

Recognizing Chris and Snoop in the darkness Bodie and Poot realize that the pair have arrived to kill Bodie. Poot urges him to flee but Bodie refuses to run from his own territory. Spider runs while Bodie fires into the darkness. Poot makes a final plea and then takes flight himself. Bodie, refusing to back down from Marlo and the Stanfield Organization any longer, stands his ground and fires at Chris and Snoop, yelling to them that he isn't running away from them and that they won't put his body in an empty row house as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> their other victims. As Bodie is distracted by Chris and Snoop, O-Dog steps from a doorway and shoots him {{in the back of the}} head.

2500|$|The {{wealth of}} foreign-minted coins {{could not have}} escaped Trott. He must have known that the ship's crew were not merely {{unlicensed}} slavers, likely noting the patched-up battle damage on the Fancy. When word eventually reached that the Royal Navy and East India Company were hunting for the Fancy and that [...] "Captain Bridgeman" [...] was Every himself, Trott denied ever knowing anything about the pirates' history other than what they told him, adamant that the island's population [...] "saw no reason to disbelieve them." [...] This he argued {{despite the fact that}} the proclamation for the pirates' capture specifically warned that Every's crew could [...] "probably be known and discovered by the great quantities of Gold and Silver of forreign Coines which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] In the meantime, however, Every's men were free to frequent the town's pubs. Nevertheless, the crew soon found themselves disappointed with the Bahamas; the islands were sparsely populated, meaning that there was virtually no place to spend the money they had pirated. For the next several months the pirates spent most of their time living in relative boredom. By now Trott had stripped the Fancy of everything valuable, and it was lost after being violently driven against some rocks, perhaps deliberately on the orders of Trott who was eager to rid himself of a key piece of evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Both Citigroup and the Mets {{maintain}} that the naming rights deal is secure, despite Citigroup's economic troubles. This deal has been criticized {{in light of the}} late-2000s financial crisis and the $45 billion of taxpayer funds allocated to Citigroup by the U.S. federal government in two separate rescue packages, prompting New York City Council members Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo to suggest that the new ballpark be called [...] "Citi/Taxpayer Field." [...] Radio talk show host Brian Lehrer suggested the name [...] "Debits Field" [...] which combines baseball history with public outrage over the Citi bailout. [...] Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who serves on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated in regards to the Citi Field naming rights deal, [...] "This type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroup's new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer.... I strongly urge Citigroup {{to find a way out}} of this contract and instead spend that $400 million on retaining its employees and restoring confidence in its operations." [...] On January 29, 2009, congressmen Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Ted Poe of Texas sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner urging him to scrap Citigroup's $400 million naming rights deal. [...] "We request that you intervene and demand that Citigroup dissolve the agreement <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the New York Mets," [...] reads the letter. [...] "Absent this outcome, we feel strongly that you should compel Citigroup to return immediately all federal monies received to date, as well as cancel all loan guarantees." [...] However, Geithner rejected congressional demands to cancel the naming rights deal.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish Inquisition {{had been}} {{established}} in part to prevent conversos from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, {{they were supposed to}} have given up. However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of conversos was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for formally expelling all Jews from Spain was the [...] "great harm suffered by Christians (i.e., conversos) from the contact, intercourse and communication which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith". The Alhambra Decree, issued in January 1492, ordered the expulsion. Historic accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain have been vastly exaggerated by early accounts and historians: Juan de Mariana speaks of 800,000 people, and Don Isaac Abravanel of 300,000. Modern estimates, based on careful examination of official documents and population estimates of communities, are much lower: Henry Kamen estimates that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 conversos, about 40,000 chose emigration. The Jews of the kingdom of Castile emigrated mainly to Portugal (whence they were expelled in 1497) and to North Africa. However, according to Kamen, the Jews of the kingdom of Aragon went [...] "to adjacent Christian lands, mainly to Italy", rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed. Although the vast majority of conversos simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present {{as a result of the}} Alhambra Decree.|$|E
