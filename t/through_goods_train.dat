50|$|December 1890. A pick-up {{goods train}} was being shunted from the up line across the down line into the yard to bring out some laden trucks, when another goods train, coming from Abergavenny and bound for Newport, dashed into it and cut it in two. The {{accident}} {{was due to the}} steep gradient and' the inability of the driver of the <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to pull up in time to avert the mischief.|$|E
50|$|A Durchgangsgüterzug (abbreviation: Dg, literally: <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train)</b> is a {{category}} of German train that describes a goods train that runs directly to its destination with the same train formation. No shunting takes place at intermediate stations and it is usually a unit train. In addition to transporting freight between marshalling yards, these trains are also used to move large quantities of bulk goods on set routes (e.g. coal and ore) from ports to power stations and steelworks.|$|E

50|$|A Nahgüterzug (abbreviation: Ng) is {{the name}} given to a {{category}} of local goods train in German-speaking countries. It describes a type of goods train that, unlike the Durchgangsgüterzug (<b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train)</b> - does not stay together for its entire journey; instead wagons can be added or dropped off at intermediate stations en route. And unlike the Übergabegüterzug (goods exchange train) Nahgüterzüge run from one railway hub to another, usually between two marshalling yards. Along the way various groups of wagons are detached or collected at the intermediate stations.|$|E
5000|$|An Übergabegüterzug (abbreviated to: Üg or Übergabe, {{literally}} <b>goods</b> exchange <b>train)</b> is a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{that moves}} individual goods wagons {{on the first}} or last stage of their journey i.e. from the start to the first railway hub or from the final railway hub to its destination. Between hubs the wagons are hauled by Nahgüterzüge (Ng), i.e. local <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> or Durchgangsgüterzüge (<b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains).</b> These trains generally cover relatively short distances and {{only have a few}} wagons that are delivered to and collected from industrial or loading sidings, either individually or in so-called wagon groups.|$|R
50|$|Beyond Platform 8 are two tracks, {{known as}} Park Sidings, {{which are used}} for {{stabling}} trains between services, but most trains are nowadays kept on the platform tracks between arrival and departure. There are some more sidings adjacent to platform 1. There is an extra track between platforms 4 and 5 for <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> and shunting manoeuvres.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{used the}} line, {{especially}} between Market Harborough and Newark. Local traffic was mainly derived from ironstone workings near Waltham-on-the-Wolds. These working were {{served by a}} GNR branch line from Scalford opened on 5 April 1883. Waltham also had a station {{but it was only}} used for race specials and never had a regular service.|$|R

50|$|At {{this period}} the Dundee and Perth (DP&AR) trains were {{arriving}} {{to the south}} of the station and reversing into it. In 1861 separate platforms outside the main station and at right angles to it, were opened; they were referred to as the Dundee Dock. <b>Through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> to the north were diverted to tracks {{on the west side of}} the station itself, but there were still complaints about congestion.|$|R

50|$|There was {{a decline}} in usage of local railway {{stations}} from about 1930 as the quality of rural roads improved, and motor lorries and buses became available; inevitably {{this led to a}} loss of railway business, and on 9 June 1958, the majority of stations on the NA&HR main line were closed. The Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny line had already closed to <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> in 1954 and to passengers on 6 January 1958. This was followed by complete closure of the MT&AR on 5 April 1971.|$|R
25|$|Whilst under construction, the TVR {{was bought}} by the London and Birmingham Railway (L) on 15 April 1846, the L itself amalgamating with other {{railways}} to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 16 July 1846. The Trent Valley line was opened to a limited service of local passenger <b>trains</b> and <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> on 15 September 1847, to local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> on 20 October 1847 (the delay due to the goods-handling facilities at the stations not being completed) and finally to all through traffic on 1 December 1847. It {{is now part of}} what is called the West Coast Main Line.|$|R
2500|$|Procedures {{to sustain}} staff during a round-the clock {{disaster}} recovery effort {{are included in}} any good disaster recovery plan. Procedures for the stocking of food and water, capabilities of administering CPR/first aid, and dealing with family emergencies are clearly written and tested. [...] This can generally be accomplished by the company <b>through</b> <b>good</b> <b>training</b> programs and a clear definition of job responsibilities. [...] A review of the readiness capacity of a plan often includes tasks such as inquires of personnel, direct physical observation, and examination of training records and any certifications.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the line}} had mainly been built with <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> in mind, the LNWR built four {{intermediate}} passenger stations on the line, all opening on 3 May 1886. The first out of Stalybridge was Staley and Millbrook; next was Micklehurst; the third station from Stalybridge was Friezland and the nearest to the junction at Diggle and the tunnel entrance was Uppermill. Passenger traffic in this sparsely populated Pennine valley was light. Micklehurst {{was closed to}} passengers on 1 May 1907; Staley and Millbrook on 1 November 1909; and Uppermill and Friezland stations on 1 January 1917.|$|R

50|$|The Gospel Oak to Barking line (sometimes unofficially {{called the}} GOBLIN) {{is part of}} the Network Rail network of railway lines. It carries both <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> and London Overground {{passenger}} trains, connecting Gospel Oak station in north London and Barking station in east London. The line is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 6, and is classified as a London and South East Commuter line. For much of its existence the line has played a minor role in London's transport system; however, it is now receiving significant investment to increase its capacity, which will include full 25 kV AC overhead electrification, due to be completed in Spring 2018.|$|R
5000|$|The first joint service, a <b>goods</b> <b>train,</b> ran on 13 April 1891. Services were {{worked by}} the Midland {{with its own}} engines but they proved too heavy for the track and so East and West Junction Railway {{locomotives}} were used between Olney and Broom after 8 December 1891. Olney became important as the terminus of SMJR freight operations from Broom and the west; the goods service consisted of <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> from Olney to [...] and local trains. Between Olney and Towcester, the line was only open at night, with three services departing Olney between 00.00 and 03.30 on Tuesdays to Saturdays; the first two {{went as far as}} Broom and the last terminated at Woodford West Junction. Three services terminated at Olney at around 03.00 on Tuesday and Saturday mornings and just before midnight on the other days; the first came from Towcester, and the other two from Broom. On Sundays there was an early <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to Broom.|$|R
50|$|With the {{build-up}} {{of holiday}} {{traffic in the}} 20th century, the route also proved a useful alternative to the congested Bournemouth line for summer Saturday trains to Weymouth and Swanage. <b>Through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> also continued regularly to use the line. The central section of the Southampton and Dorchester Railway from Lymington Junction (exclusive) to Broadstone Junction (exclusive) was closed to passengers on 4 May 1964, {{one of the first}} closures following the Beeching Report of March 1963. The line east of Ringwood was closed completely and the track lifted in 1965. However public goods services continued from the Poole direction until August 1967 and the track was shortly thereafter lifted back to the RAOC fuel depot at West Moors.|$|R

25|$|The biggest {{disaster}} {{in the history of}} the BVZ occurred in its jubilee year of 1991. On 18 April at 6.45 am, approximately 15 million cubic metres of rock broke away from the Wartfluh northwest of Randa and buried the Vispa and parts of the hamlet Lerc, along with 100 metres of railway track. No people were injured, as the hamlet Lerch was uninhabited and at the time of the landslide there was no train in the affected section of track. However, a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> heading for Zermatt was left standing a few hundred metres north of the incident site, after its traction failed due to damage to the overhead line and the resulting short circuit. Passenger and goods traffic was temporarily moved to the road, which was left undamaged. Between Herbriggen and Randa, omnibuses operated bustitution services, and between Randa and Zermatt the trains ran in a shuttle service. As from 22 April, it was again possible to operate <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> for which a diesel locomotive of type HGm 4/4 was hired from the Furka Oberalp Bahn. Passenger traffic initially remained suspended, as further landslides could not be ruled out.|$|R
50|$|The Midland Railway {{had been}} running <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> and mineral <b>trains</b> over the line between Broom and Olney for some time with its own engines, but the very light track on the SMJR line was {{experiencing}} serious damage, and from 8 December 1891 the Midland engines were taken off and the through traffic worked by SMJR engines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} opened on 20 October 1876; see Palmerston North Central railway station. Traffic increased {{with the opening}} of the line to Napier via Woodville in 1891, and the station was moved 30 chains (603m) south in March 1891. But it was still a bottleneck, and remained the longest-persisting bottleneck on the Main Trunk until the 1960s. Changes were recommended by Hiley in 1914, a commission in 1916 and the Fay-Raven commission in 1924-25. Construction of the Milson Deviation to shift the line and station northwest and away from the centre of Palmerston North started in May 1926, but was delayed by the depression and World War II, and objections from the local business quarter. Work by the Public Works Department (PWD) was stopped in 1929 by Minister of Works Alfred Ransom and restarted in 1938 by Bob Semple but halted by the war. Finally resumed in 1957 under John McAlpine, the first stage to Milson from the north-east was opened on 22 April 1954. The deviation was opened to Longburn for <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> on 27 July 1959. On 21 October 1963 the new station and yards were opened, and all rail traffic removed from the main street and square of Palmerston North. The old line was closed by mid-1965, and the Awapuni railway station south of the main station on the old route was also closed ...|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{bridge on}} {{this site was}} opened in 1871 and cost £20,000 to build. It is a six-span wrought-iron hog-back bridge on five {{cast-iron}} cylinder piers. It was set {{at an angle to}} the river so that trains could approach the bridge at speed, there being no sharp curve onto the bridge. It required strengthening in 1943. It was taken out of use permanently on 4 October 1982, when the trains on the N&CR were re-routed across the King Edward VII Bridge and <b>through</b> Dunston. <b>Goods</b> <b>trains</b> continued to use the line {{on the north side of}} the Tyne up until around 1990, taking coal to the Stella North Power Station and materials to the Ever Ready battery factory at Newburn.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to answer the {{following}} question: "Are school headmasters in different European countries comparable?" The author deals with the subject of further training of school headmasteres in the Czech Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany (Bavaria and North Rhine - Westphalia) and Scotland. With the help of selected research methods which were a questionnaire and interviews with headmasters he is trying to report on the opportunities of their further training in selected countries. The author finds out that further training of headmasters focuses primarily on managerial and vocational training. The necessity of further qualification of executives arises from the fact that nowadays headmasters have to meet a wide range of requirements in terms of their competence which they receive <b>through</b> <b>good</b> specialised <b>training.</b> The information obtained can serve as a model or methodological recommendation as in each country the managerial training follows different qualifying models.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to answer the {{following}} question: ‚Is it possible to compare qualification training and forms of further training of headmasters in different countries?' The author of this thesis deals with headmaster training in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia). He obtained information about education systems and education opportunities in these countries through selected research methods which were a questionnaire and interviews with school headmasters. The need for proper managerial qualification of headmasters necessary for them to meet requirements for discharge of the function is proved by the fact that today headmasters have to cope with demands made on their competency readiness which they can receive <b>through</b> <b>good</b> specialized <b>training.</b> The information obtained {{can be used as a}} pattern or methodical recommendations because in every country the managerial education follows different qualifying models.

5000|$|The {{availability}} of the Maindee East Loop coupled {{with the opening of}} the Severn Tunnel in 1886 vastly simplified the transfer of coal traffic to London and also to Portland and Southampton, where bunkering Royal Navy and ocean-going commercial shipping was experiencing considerable growth. As far as passenger services were concerned, as well as trains from Cardiff and Newport to the Hereford and Shrewsbury line, a developing traffic ran from Bristol and the West of England after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886 northwards from Maindee East Junction through Hereford. This enabled trains to reach the River Mersey (at Birkenhead) over track controlled solely or jointly by the GWR, whereas routing via Gloucester and Birmingham was dependent on the co-operation of competing companies. The route was marketed as [...] "The North and West Route", and use of the route for <b>through</b> <b>goods</b> and passenger <b>trains</b> became very heavy.|$|R

The objective of the present study is to evaluate knowledge and satisfaction of patients included in the Dader Program. Methods: We designed and distributed a anonymous questionnaire among patients under pharmacotherapy follow-up by the Dader method in Herreruela and Alcañizo community pharmacies between 1 st January and 15 th March 2004. Results: Questionnaire was answered by 89 % of patients. Average age is 65 years old. 91 % of patients did not know pharmacotherapy follow-up before it was offered. 26 % accepted follow-up looking for an improvement in their health status, while 74 % did it because of their confidence in the pharmacist. 89 % feels that it has produced an improvement in their status, and 83 % believe that pharmacist-patient-physician relationship has not been affected; even 4 % believe that this relationship has improved. More than 94 % considered that they had received a excellent personal and professional treat. 74 % states they are satisfied with the pharmacotherapy follow-up service, and 94 % believe that their illnesses are better treated. Conclusions: Patients under pharmacotherapy follow-up know and positively appreciate this service. Confidence in their pharmacist was the main reason to accept the service. Patients are quite satisfied with pharmacotherapy follow-up, and they recognize pharmacist professionalism and accessibility, and so health outcomes achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish a high level understanding of cyber defence capabilities across EDA 2 ̆ 7 s participating Member States (pMS) to support progress toward a more consistent level of cyber defence capability across the EU. Specifically, the study aimed to inform further action at the EU and national level. This stocktaking exercise included research into the different EU level organisations involved in cyber-defence activities in the context of common security and defence policy missions as well as data collection on cyber defence capabilities in each Member State. This was accomplished according to a common capability framework. The research was carried out via document review, semi-structured interviews and the development of a questionnaire distributed to those EU Member States participating in the EDA 2 ̆ 7 s Cyber Defence Project Team. EU-level recommendations stemming from this report include elements of enhancing EU network protection; strengthening intelligence capability; deepening incident response capabilities; creating a culture of cyber-security (<b>through</b> <b>good</b> practice, <b>training</b> and awareness-raising) and reinforcing links between NATO and the EU for cyber defence issues. For participating member states, the report recommends greater attention should be given to the development of cyber defence training and education initiatives; consideration should be given, to a certain extent, to sharing facilities and processes and information could be exchanged and developed to execute greater leadership in cyber defence.
