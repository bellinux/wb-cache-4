5|$|Purgatory is a {{temporary}} condition for the purification of souls who, although destined for Heaven, are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven immediately. In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> <b>of</b> the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints.|$|E

5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> <b>of</b> medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E

5|$|Each {{of these}} priests, either as secular clergy, or as previously, {{members of a}} {{religious}} order, is obligated to say the “Holy Office” every day. To this end, cathedrals normally {{have a number of}} small chapels used for private devotion or for small groups. In England there is a strong tradition that each chapel should face the east. For this reason the transepts of English cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries, and there is often a second transept, as at Salisbury. This arrangement permits a greater number of eastward-facing chapels. That part of the main interior which is furthest to the east and reserved for <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> <b>of</b> the clergy is the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> <b>of</b> the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E
5|$|Living a worldly {{life during}} the day, he {{reportedly}} spent his evenings in vigils and prayer, putting into practice {{the writings of}} two authors—Marcus Eremita and Diadochos of Photiki—that were {{given to him by}} his spiritual father. It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later in one of his Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> <b>of</b> Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct personal experience of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E

5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> <b>of</b> the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prayer</b> <b>of</b> Quiet {{is a term}} from Christian theology. It is {{regarded}} by writers on mystical theology {{as one of the}} degrees of contemplation or contemplative prayer, and must be distinguished therefore from meditation and from affective prayer. It holds an intermediary place between affective <b>prayer</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Prayer</b> <b>of</b> Union. As <b>the</b> name implies, <b>the</b> <b>Prayer</b> <b>of</b> Quiet is considered a state in which the soul experiences an extraordinary peace and rest, accompanied by delight or pleasure in contemplating God as present.|$|R
