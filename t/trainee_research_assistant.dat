40|$|Research {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of knowledge and, hence, wealth generation, so it is timely to consider a neglected category of the research workforce, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> The <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> has traditionally been part of the fabric, if not the structure, of university research efforts but despite the extent of the contribution, the breadth of skills and the depth of qualifications often brought to the position of <b>research</b> <b>assistant,</b> there is no overt professional pathway articulated for these research workers. Equally, there is an implicit, if not overt lack of recognition of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> role in processes of knowledge generation. This lack of recognition is reflected in the difficulty of defining the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> role and articulating how it differs across disciplines. This paper considers the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> in the current research landscape and culture of Australian universities, providing background to a wide-ranging empirical study of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> workforce exploring the experience of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> and the significance of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> role in knowledge generation. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that, in general, older professors are rated to have more passive-avoidant leadership styles than younger professors by their <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> The current study investigated professors 2 ̆ 7 age-related work concerns and <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> 2 ̆ 7 favorable age stereotypes as possible explanations for this finding. Data came from 128 university professors paired to one <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> each. Results show that professors 2 ̆ 7 age-related work concerns (decreased enthusiasm for research, growing humanism, development of exiting consciousness and increased follower empowerment) did not explain the relationships between professor age and <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> ratings of passive-avoidant and proactive leadership. However, <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> 2 ̆ 7 favorable age stereotypes influenced the relationships between professor age and <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> ratings of leadership, such that older professors were rated as more passive-avoidant and less proactive than younger professors by <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> with less favorable age stereotypes, but not by <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> with more favorable age stereotypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} science perceptions of the <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> as early career academics. For this aim the questionnaire composing three main parts was conducted to 347 <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> from a state university in Turkey. The findings of the study revealed that the <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> generally have strong interest to their academic fields. Another important finding was that <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> have a pragmatic approach toward the idea of science. Results also pointed out that majority of the <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> consider themselves as an intellectual on science. The results of this study are expected to enhance scientific culture at universities by revealing the current science perception among <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> © 2013 IOJES.

40|$|Science inevitably {{involves}} ethical {{discussions about}} how {{research should be}} implemented. However such discussions often neglect the potential unethical treatment of a third party: the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> Extensive anecdotal evidence suggests that <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> can experience unique physical, psychological, and social risks when implementing their typical responsibilities. Moreover, these <b>research</b> <b>assistants,</b> who perhaps engage in research experience to bolster their curricula vitae, may feel coerced {{to continue to work}} in unsafe environments out of fear of losing rapport with the research supervisor or letters of recommendation for their future endeavors. In the present article, we address two important issues regarding the ethical treatment of <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> First, we present evidence suggesting that <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> may experience substantive risk when implementing their assigned responsibilities. Second, we propose a document, the “Research Assistant’s Bill of Rights,” as a possible ethics code for people supervising <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> This document is independent from typical institutional review board processes, and {{it has the potential to}} maximize benefits to research supervisors and <b>research</b> <b>assistants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Please do not cite without {{permission}} of the author. Comments are welcome. To inform the ongoing debate over graduate student unionization, the author tests {{for the presence of}} unionrelated premiums among teaching and <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> stipends using data from The Chronicle of Higher Education’s survey of departments in six fields in 2000, 2001, and 2003. Ordinary least squares and instrumental variables methods reveal union and union threat premiums among teaching assistant stipends. There is little evidence of union-related premiums among <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> stipends. Specifications controlling for union composition or using employment weights reveal that the teaching assistant only union premium is positive for teaching assistant stipends and negative for <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> stipends. This suggests that collectively bargained contracts may yield benefits for teaching assistants at the expense of <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> when the latter are excluded from the bargaining unit. There is a positive premium to joint teaching and <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> unions for teaching assistant stipends and no effect for <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> stipends. 2...|$|R
50|$|A <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> is a {{researcher}} employed, often {{on a temporary}} contract, by a university or a research institute, {{for the purpose of}} assisting in academic <b>research.</b> <b>Research</b> <b>assistants</b> are not independent and not directly responsible for the outcome of the research and are responsible to a supervisor or principal investigator. <b>Research</b> <b>assistants</b> are often educated to degree level and might be enrolled in a postgraduate degree program and simultaneously teach.|$|R

30|$|The general {{procedure}} for performing the {{content analysis of}} annual reports is outlined below: the principal investigator and the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> performed the content analysis. Prior to the coding process, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> was given a detailed briefing on what constitutes a CSR disclosure, {{the use of the}} coding instrument and an explanation of the different categories and types of disclosure. During the briefing session, the principal investigator used several different annual reports that were not part of the actual sample used for the study to highlight different types of disclosures. At the end of the session, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> was then handed a few annual reports to attempt the coding. Upon completion of this preliminary round of coding, the principal investigator reviewed the coding and categorisations performed by the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> The principal investigator addressed specific issues in coding raised by the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> Following this initial round, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> and the principal investigator both were involved in the coding process of the annual reports and discussed any ambiguity of the items of disclosure, which were reviewed and resolved. This was carried out to ensure consistency and reliability in the content analysis procedure.|$|R

40|$|<b>Research</b> <b>assistants</b> play a {{vital role}} in the {{research}} process, often acting as more than just translators or interpreters. However, their contributions to and impacts on the research process and outcomes often remain unacknowledged or unaccounted for. We build on previous work that looks at the subjective relations between the researcher, <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> and <b>research</b> participant to explore this issue. In particular, drawing on a political economy approach, we look at how <b>research</b> <b>assistants,</b> through their objective position, mediate relations between researcher and participants, and also how power relations and different configurations of roles influence the research process and outcomes. Our analysis concludes that ignoring the role of <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> in empirical <b>research</b> will lead to flawed processes, biased data and possibly misleading results...|$|R
