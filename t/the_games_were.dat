5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Games</b> <b>were</b> {{the most}} watched Olympics in history, {{attracting}} 4.7 billion viewers worldwide {{and landed on}} Guinness World Records.

5|$|The Olympics were of {{fundamental}} religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias {{stood in his}} temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis. The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> <b>were</b> held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks {{as one of their}} units of time measurement. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> <b>were</b> part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{to hold an}} inter-continental {{sporting}} event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to Kuwait and <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> <b>were</b> proposed {{to be held in}} 1985. Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games. In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> <b>were</b> then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.|$|E
