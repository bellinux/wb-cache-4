Forced {{to work together to}} survive, they come <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> is no ordinary island.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} primary Upanishadic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for {{different}} purposes. In one case, for example, {{they go to}} Prajāpati, their father, {{to understand what is}} Self (Atman, soul) and how <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it.</b> The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} of Portal 2 initially envisioned it as a prequel to Portal {{set in the}} 1950s, long before GLaDOS took over the Aperture Science facility, with events set in motion when Aperture CEO Cave Johnson is put into a computer, only <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake. Johnson would have led an army of robots, which would battle against the player to rise to power within Aperture. In June 2008, based on information from a casting call website and leaked script samples, Kotaku reported that Valve was seeking voice actors to play Johnson, named him as an AI and identified the game as a prequel. Valve attributed this leak to an [...] "overeager agent". Following negative playtester feedback about the omission of Chell and GLaDOS, Portal 2 was re-conceived as a sequel. The team returned {{to the idea of}} exploring parts of the facility from Aperture's early days, and reincorporated Johnson through a series of recordings.|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally {{be able to talk to}} her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E

500|$|When it {{came time}} for a video for [...] "Jurassic Park", Yankovic opted to use stop-motion and claymation; he joked during a Q that this was because [...] "it's just too hard to find real live dinosaurs these days." [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was Yankovic's first video that was entirely animated—previous videos, such as [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] and [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] had {{featured}} elements of animation. The video was directed by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund. Yankovic initially heard of the duo from Bill Manspeaker, the lead singer of the comedy rock band Green Jellÿ. After being hired for the project, the two [...] "basically turned a private residence in Los Angeles into a clay animation studio." [...] The two worked between July and August 1993, and slept in shifts, so that the final project would be ready for its release in October 1993. One critic noted that the music video seems to have been done in the style of Will Vinton's Dinosaurs! – A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time! The video parodies scenes from, as well as the general plot of the 1993 movie, and contains a myriad of sight-gags—as is usual for Yankovic's videos—such as a claymation version of Steven Spielberg running from dinosaurs, Barney having his head ripped off, and a Velociraptor attempting to break down a door, only <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> has a key.|$|E

According to the yU+co's official website, the idea behind the sequence is, [...] "to evoke the show's quirky spirit and playful flouting of women's traditional role in society." [...] The images featured are taken from eight pieces of art, portraying domesticity and male–female relations through the ages.|$|E
2500|$|More importantly, {{however, the}} Frankfurt School {{attempted}} {{to define the}} fate of reason in the new historical period. While Marcuse did so through analysis of structural changes in the labor process under capitalism and inherent features of the methodology of science, Horkheimer and Adorno concentrated on a re-examination of the foundation of critical theory. This effort appears in systematized form in Adorno's Negative Dialectics, which tries to redefine dialectics for {{an era in which}} [...] "philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> was missed". Negative dialectics expresses the idea of critical thought so conceived that the apparatus of domination cannot co-opt it.|$|E

2500|$|By 1792, slave rebels {{controlled}} a {{third of}} the island. The success of the slave rebellion caused the newly elected Legislative Assembly in France <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> was facing an ominous situation. To protect France's economic interests, the Assembly granted civil and political rights to free men of color in the colonies [...] in March 1792. Countries throughout Europe as well as the United States were shocked by the decision, but the Assembly was determined to stop the revolt. Apart from granting rights to the free people of color, the Assembly dispatched 6,000 French soldiers to the island. The new governor sent by Paris, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax was a supporter of the French Revolution who abolished slavery in the Northern Province of Saint Domingue and had hostile relations with the planters, whom he saw as royalists.|$|E

2500|$|Strain theory, {{also known}} as Mertonian Anomie, {{advanced}} by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream, {{and it becomes a}} powerful cultural and psychological motivation. Merton also used the term anomie, but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. [...] Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve. [...] Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it.</b> Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (such as gang members, or what he calls [...] "hobos").|$|E

Mohiam says, [...] "I've said too much, {{but the fact remains}} that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us."

2500|$|Science fiction {{author and}} {{physicist}} Gregory Benford has declared that: [...] "SF {{is perhaps the}} defining genre of the twentieth century, although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels." [...] This sense of exclusion was articulated by Jonathan Lethem in an essay published in the Village Voice entitled [...] "Close Encounters: The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction." [...] Lethem suggests that the point in 1973 when Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow was nominated for the Nebula Award, and was passed over in favor of Arthur C.

2500|$|The {{concept for}} what would become Sakura Wars was created in 1990 when Oji Hiroi saw a Japanese stage {{production}} of the play Shanghai Rhapsody, and {{was impressed by the}} spectacle he saw from the acting troop on stage. Later in 1993, Hiroi and anime composer Kohei Tanaka worked together on an original video animation adaptation of the video game [...] Hiroi was highly impressed by Tanaka's music, {{to the point where he}} wanted to create a musical set to Tanaka's music. This concept evolved into the wish for Tanaka to score a video game which focused on theater. Beginning in 1993, a small team in the Planning Department of Red Company led by Hiroi began promoting his concept and planning the game's basic concepts. At this stage, the project was just titled [...] due to the wish to connect it with Japan, and was described as an [...] "example plan" [...] rather than a practical project. While distinct from the final Sakura Wars, the proposal shared an alternate historical setting with steampunk technology, a female lead, and mecha combat. In addition to Hiroi, the team included three young Red Company artists. Two of the artists — Ryoma Kaneko and Naoki Morita — would later work on Sakura Wars proper. While developing the [...] "Sakura" [...] proposal, Hiroi and his team created two tabletop role-playing games dubbed [...] "Sakura 1" [...] and [...] "Sakura 2", which resulted in the strategy elements almost overriding the other aspects. Inspired by the combination of tactical combat and story used in the Fire Emblem series, Hiroi steered the project more in that direction. Influences from contemporary anime were also added to bring depths to the story and characters. With the basic elements defined, the team continued to refine the project over between half a year and a year. Having confidence in the project's potential to become a video game, Hiroi presented [...] "Sakura" [...] to multiple game companies, but none of them had confidence in the project. With no-one interested, Hiroi put the project to one side, expecting that it would not enter production despite his continued determination <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
