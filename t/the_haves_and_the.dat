She discussed her incorporation of the android as a metaphor for a minority, whilst being the role of the story's protagonist also. In {{an interview}} for Blues & Soul, Monáe said [...] "she represents the MEDIATOR between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> have-nots, the minority and the majority. So in that way she’s very similar to Neo, the Archangel from The Matrix. And basically her return will mean freedom for the android community".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{was also}} {{reportedly}} seeking coalition with whites {{in order to}} approach what were considered racial problems as economic and class problems, [...] "When we change the race problem into a class fight between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> have-nots, then {{we are going to}} have a new ball game", he said. In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.|$|E

2500|$|The Telegraph {{published}} {{an interview with}} Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, [...] "I begin to worry {{for a moment that}} Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction nerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between James Brown, Judy Garland, André 3000 and Steve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." [...] She also compared Monáe to artists such as Annie Lennox, Lauryn Hill, and Corinne Bailey Rae. Her musical styles have been described as [...] "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz". The Guardian has noted some of her influences as: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Outkast, Erykah Badu, James Brown, Grace Jones, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Bernard Herrmann, Funkadelic and the Incredible String Band. Matthew Valnes likens her dancing style in the music video for [...] "Tightrope", to that of James Brown. In an opinion piece for The Quietus, John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the Afrofuturism movement, pointing out her similarities to Sun Ra and George Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has stated that she has an alter-ego named Cindi Mayweather who according to Monáe is from the year 2719. In [...] she gave her alter-ego a back-story stating that she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human named Anthony Greendown. Monáe explained about Cindi, saying [...] "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the Archangel in the Bible, and what Neo represents to the Matrix." [...] In her second album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to [...] "suppress freedom and love". Chris Champion of The Observer described Metropolis and The ArchAndroid as [...] "psychedelic soul with a sci-fi twist". Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where her android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of the 1960's through the 1980's is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. On the website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective, they assert [...] "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk." [...] Monáe has also referred to herself as a [...] "funkstress".|$|E
6000|$|The {{injustice}} {{of the existing}} set of rules simply appals the Radical. Yet oddly enough, this injustice itself appeals rather to the comparative looker-on than to the heavily-handicapped players in person. They, poor creatures, dragging their log in patience, have grown so accustomed to regarding the world as another man's oyster, that they put up uncomplainingly {{for the most part}} with the most patent inequalities. Perhaps 'tis their want of imagination that makes them unable to conceive any other state of things as even possible--like the dog who accepts kicking as the natural fate of doghood. At any rate, you will find, if you look about you, that the chief reformers are not, as a rule, the ill-used classes themselves, but the sensitive and thinking souls who hate and loathe the injustice with which others are treated. Most of the best Radicals I have known were men of gentle birth and breeding. Not all: others, just as earnest, just as eager, just as chivalrous, sprang from the masses. Yet the gently-reared preponderate. It is a common Tory taunt to say that the battle is one between <b>the</b> <b>Haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Have-nots. That is by no means true. It is between the selfish Haves, on one side, and the unselfish Haves, who wish to see something done for the Have-nots, on the other. As for the poor Have-nots themselves, they are mostly inarticulate. Indeed, the Tory almost admits as much when he alters his tone and describes the sympathising and active few as [...] "paid agitators." ...|$|E
