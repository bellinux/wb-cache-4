As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> limiting proliferation.|$|E

Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{functional}} equivalence among stimuli {{arose from the}} ”generic ” property of the discriminative stimulus (SD) defined by Skinner (1935). That is, a number of distinct stimuli, say A, B, C, each of which controls <b>the</b> <b>same</b> given response in an equivalent fashion, may constitute a stimulus class under certain historical and envi-ronmental conditions. If they do, the observed behaviors can be described consistently by the three-term contingency of Eq. (1). It is then said that A, B, and C are functionally equivalent {{in the sense that}} they have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> behav-ior. This relation should be differentiated from a set of contingencies each of which is learned in-dependently to one another as in Eq. (2). How can one differentiate the former functional equiva-lence class from the latter multiple contingencies? In both, A, B, and C have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> overt behavior. This situation may also be the case in Pavlovian conditioning, as I will briefly discuss later...|$|R
25|$|The {{influence}} of Roman governance and Roman technology on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion {{led to the}} adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by Historia Naturalis, an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by Pliny the Elder. Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen, established that today's medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin. Roman engineering had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> scientific terminology as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms.|$|E
25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{purchase}} of the Burlington by GN and NP, expansion continued. In 1908, the CB purchased both the Colorado & Southern and Fort Worth & Denver Railways, giving it access south to Dallas and the Gulf of Mexico ports in Houston and Galveston. It also extended its reach south in the Mississippi Valley region by opening up a new line from Concord, Illinois south to Paducah, Kentucky. It was during this period that the Burlington was at its largest, exceeding just over 12,000 route miles in 14 states by the 1920s. With the First World War having <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the railroad as on all other railroads, during the 1920s, the Burlington Route had an increasingly heavy amount of equipment flooding the yards. With the advent of the Great Depression, the CB held a good portion of this for scrap. Despite the decrease of passengers, it was during this time that the railroad introduced the famed Zephyrs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E

This is described in the oral tradition as a cyclic process, with Nyeeruna's right hand brightening and fading over time.|$|E

500|$|Clearmountain {{was said}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{recording}} engineers to hang tissue paper over the tweeters of the NS-10 to tame the over-bright treble.

[...] Recording engineer Bob Hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper. He found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering, where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. [...] Hodas derided the tissue practice as [...] "aberrant behaviour", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects. [...] He also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable. Newell et al. noted that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, where they are routinely removed, they would have had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{insanity}} in English law dates from 1324, when the Statute de Praerogativa Regis allowed the King {{to take the}} lands of idiots and lunatics. The early law used various words, including [...] "idiot", [...] "fool" [...] and [...] "sot" [...] to refer {{to those who had}} been insane since birth, and [...] "lunatic" [...] for those who had later become insane, or were insane with some lucid intervals. In the criminal law, insanity was used as a defence in a roughly identical way from this point until the late 16th century; if an insane person commits a crime, he was not punished {{in the same way that}} a sane felon who committed the same crime would be. This was for several reasons; firstly, the cruel punishment usually meted out to felons to set an example would not have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the insane. Secondly, as felonies required a mens rea, an insane person could not be guilty because they did not have the capacity to hold a mens rea. Thirdly, the phrase furiosus solo fitrere punitur was used; [...] "a lunatic was punished by his madness alone".|$|E
500|$|According to {{intersex}} {{activist and}} academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person's sexual attraction determines {{his or her}} gender. Cal's wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link between gender identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie [...] "denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality." [...] Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees {{with the belief that}} being attracted to females is [...] "masculine" [...] and thus it is [...] "more natural" [...] for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Review of Books argued that Callie {{does not have to be}} a male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, [...] "Breasts have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> me as on anyone with my testosterone level." [...] Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish [...] "Eugenides's (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership". Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie's erotic interest in girls is [...] "retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his 'true biological nature'." [...] Cal's gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal's inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth.|$|E
