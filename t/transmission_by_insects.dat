One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insects.</b> In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E

Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy {{to promote their}} <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insect</b> vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact <b>insects,</b> as demonstrated <b>by</b> the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG 8 -I to ATG 8 -II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3 -methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg 5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc 1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> its <b>insect</b> vector.

Current evidence suggests that the infection is transmitted through abraded skin or mild traumatic injuries after contact with contaminated water, soil, or vegetation; there is one unconfirmed preliminary report on possible <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insects.</b> The clinical picture ranges from a painless nodule to large, undermined ulcerative lesions that heal spontaneously but slowly.

Treatment is still primarily surgical, and includes excision, skin grafting, or both. Although BCG has a mild but significant protective effect, new vaccine developments directed at the toxins produced by M ulcerans are warranted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{expression}} of two small basic proteins (C and C′) encoded {{by a second}} open reading frame of the New Jersey serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) P gene was reported previously (Spiropoulou and Nichol,J. Virol., 67, 3103 – 3110, 1993). Here {{we found that the}} Indiana serotype virus also expressed C and C′ proteins from this reading frame. We eliminated C and C′ expression by making a single base change that introduced a stop codon in the C and C′ coding sequence, but left the P-protein sequence unchanged. This mutated P gene supported normal replication and packaging of VSV minigenomes encoding G and M proteins. The mutated P gene was also recombined into an infectious clone of VSV that was used to recover virus. The mutant virus no longer expressed the C and C′ proteins but showed growth kinetics identical to wild-type virus. The amounts of viral mRNAs and proteins synthesized were indistinguishable in mutant and wild-type virus infected cells as were the yields and composition of mutant and wild-type virus particles. The kinetics of host protein-synthesis shut-off were also identical for both viruses. Although the C and C′ proteins were dispensable for VSV growth in tissue culture, they are known to be conserved in all vesiculoviruses, and thus perhaps play a role in viral pathogenesis or <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insect</b> vectors...|$|R

Characterization of the genetic variation of viral populations provides relevant information on the processes involved in virus evolution and epidemiology and it is crucial for designing reliable diagnostic tools and developing efficient and durable disease control strategies. Here we performed an updated analysis of sequences available in Genbank and reviewed present knowledge on the genetic variability and evolutionary processes of viruses of the family Closteroviridae. Several factors have shaped the genetic structure and diversity of closteroviruses. I) A strong negative selection seems {{to be responsible for}} the high genetic stability in space and time for some viruses. II) Long distance migration, probably by human transport of infected propagative plant material, have caused that genetically similar virus isolates are found in distant geographical regions. III) Recombination between divergent sequence variants have generated new genotypes and plays an important role for the evolution of some viruses of the family Closteroviridae. IV) Interaction between virus strains or between different viruses in mixed infections may alter accumulation of certain strains. V) Host change or virus <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insect</b> vectors induced changes in the viral population structure due to positive selection of sequence variants with higher fitness for host-virus or vector-virus interaction (adaptation) or by genetic drift due to random selection of sequence variants during the population bottleneck associated to the transmission process...|$|R

The identification of rab 1 alleles in Amylostereum chailletii and Amylostereum areolatum populations revealed that this gene is more polymorphic than the other two regions, although the diversity of all three regions was lower than what has been observed in free-living Agaricomycetes. Our data suggest that suppressed recombination might be implicated in the diversification of rab 1, while no evidence of balancing selection was detected. We also detected positive selection at only two codons, suggesting that purifying selection is important for the evolution of rab 1.

Insects exposed to healthy plants whose roots were immersed in chlortetracycline were able to acquire AY agent from diseased plants the day after removal from the antibiotic-treated plants, but the latent period of the ensuing disease in the insects was prolonged. Chlortetracycline or tylosin tartrate blocked AY infection in nymphs injected with a mixture of antibiotic and the AY agent, but polymyxin, neomycin, vancomycin, penicillin, carbomycin, or chloramphenicol did not. All tetracyclines tested, methacycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline, produced a dramatic reduction in the ability of infected vectors to transmit AY agent. Tylosin tartrate also reduced transmission when injected into AY-transmitting vectors, but carbomycin, spectinomycin, cycloserine, penicillin, erythromycin, or kanamycin had no such effect. During the first 10 days after injection of tylosin tartrate or oxytetracycline into transmitting vectors, ability of the insects to transmit AY decayed rapidly. <b>Transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insects</b> injected with buffer alone, after decreasing the first day after injection, gradually returned to its normal level in less than 1 week.

We also set out to discover whether a correlation exists between the expression of ECERIFERUM (CER) genes involved in cuticular wax synthesis and the polarization of the light reflected from the leaf surfaces. It was found that the aphid-vectored viruses Potato virus Y and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) caused significant reductions in the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves of Nicotiana tabacum, whereas the non-insect-vectored viruses Tobacco mosaic virus and Pepino mosaic virus did not induce this effect. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there was little difference in the impacts of CMV and the non-insect-vectored Turnip vein clearing virus on polarization reflection, with both viruses increasing the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves. There was a trend towards increased accumulation of CER 6 transcripts in N. tabacum and A. thaliana when infected with aphid-vectored viruses. No significant effect of infection on trichome densities was found in A. thaliana, suggesting that alterations to the formation of cuticular waxes may be the more likely phenotypic change on the leaf surface contributing to the changes in polarization reflection.

The aim of this work is to understand {{the role of the}} genetic regulon of the rpf (regulation of pathogenicity factors) system in Xf and its role in disease transmission. In Xf, the rpf system likely regulates genes important for colonization of and transmission by insect vectors. The rpfF gene is one of the essential genes of the rpf cell-cell signaling system. Transcriptional control regulates genes by cell-cell signaling. The rpfF gene codes for the enzyme that synthesises the signaling molecule, DSF (diffusible signal factor). This system regulates the expression of a host of genes that are as yet unidentified in Xf. The rpf gene cluster of Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris is required for pathogenesis of this bacterium to plants (Dow et al. 2000). In a transmission experiment with the sharpshooter leafhopper Graphocephala atropunctata (BGSS), the Xf strain KLN 61 (an rpfF knockout mutant) could not perform cell-cell signaling. It was not retained by the insect vector and consequently not transmitted to the plants (Newman, 2004).

As {{an example of a}} pathosystem with metapopulation dynamics we investigated the impact of inbreeding in the host plant Silene alba on its interaction with the anther-smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum. Seeds from eight populations of S. alba were sampled, and five generations of sib mating resulted in 65 inbred lines, with inbreeding coefficients of f = 0, 0. 25, 0. 375, 0. 5, and 0. 59 per line. In a first experiment these lines were tested for active, biochemical resistance against fungal infection, by artificially inoculating individuals. The percentage of infected individuals differed significantly among populations, lines, and inbreeding levels, and both population-by-inbreeding level and line-by-inbreeding level interactions were significant. The most striking result was the strong variance in inbreeding effects among lines; inbreeding resulted in increased resistance in some lines and decreased resistance in others. In a second experiment for 12 inbred lines, originating from one population, active resistance and Rower traits associated with passive resistance (avoidance) to this insect- vectored, florally transmitted disease were measured. Significant inbreeding depression was demonstrated for petal size and nectar volume. Thus inbreeding might enhance avoidance of spore <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insects.</b> For both active resistance and all flower traits, significant line-by-inbreeding level interactions were found. The results indicate that the effect of inbreeding on the interaction between host and pathogen in this pathosystem is unpredictable at the local population level, because: (1) strong genotypic differences in inbreeding effect exist for both active and passive resistance, making the effect of inbreeding at the population level dependent on the genotypic composition of the (founder) population (2) effects of inbreeding on active and passive resistance were not correlated, making the net effect of inbreeding on field resistance unpredictable: and (3) in several lines, evidence for epistatic effects was round, making the effect of inbreeding dependent on the actual inbreeding level of the genotype.

40|$|The {{effective}} size {{of populations}} (Ne) determines whether selection or genetic drift is the predominant force shaping their genetic structure and evolution. Populations having high Ne adapt faster, as selection acts more intensely, than populations having low Ne, where random effects of genetic drift dominate. Estimating Ne for various steps of plant {{virus life cycle}} {{has been the focus}} of several studies in the last decade, but no estimates are available for the vertical transmission of plant viruses, although virus seed transmission is economically significant in at least 18 % of plant viruses in at least one plant species. Here we study the co-dynamics of two variants of Pea seedborne mosaic virus (PSbMV) colonizing leaves of pea plants (Pisum sativum L.) during the whole flowering period, and their subsequent transmission to plant progeny through seeds. Whereas classical estimators of Ne could be used for leaf infection at the systemic level, as virus variants were equally competitive, dedicated stochastic models were needed to estimate Ne during vertical transmission. Very little genetic drift was observed during the infection of apical leaves, with Ne values ranging from 59 to 216. In contrast, a very drastic genetic drift was observed during vertical transmission, with an average number of infectious virus particles contributing to the infection of a seedling from an infected mother plant close to one. A simple model of vertical transmission, assuming a cumulative action of virus infectious particles and a virus density threshold required for vertical transmission to occur fitted the experimental data very satisfactorily. This study reveals that vertically-transmitted viruses endure bottlenecks as narrow as those imposed by horizontal transmission. These bottlenecks are likely to slow down virus adaptation and could decrease virus fitness and virulence. [br/] [br/] Author Summary Short generation times and high mutation rates are the hallmarks of virus. They favor their fast adaptation as illustrated by their ability to overcome natural as well as man-made barriers such as host resistance or drug treatments. However, such a fast adaptation could be slowed down when genetic drift, which introduces random sampling effects in the evolution of virus populations, is important. Whether genetic drift or selection dominates depends on the effective size of populations (Ne). Ne has been estimated for several steps of plant virus infectious cycle, such as horizontal <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insects</b> and the colonization of plant cells and tissues. However, although economically important, no estimate of Ne during vertical transmission of viruses, i. e. the infection of plant progenies from parental plants, is available. Here, we report that Pea seedborne mosaic virus (PSbMV), a seed transmitted virus infecting pea crops, undergoes very drastic genetic drift during vertical transmission, with an average number of infectious virus particles contributing to the infection of a seedling from an infected mother plant close to one. Such bottlenecks, as narrow as those imposed by horizontal transmission, could slow down virus adaptation and should be taken into account to improve plant protection strategies...|$|E

The cer 5 mutant leaves were less polarizing than WT on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces; gl 1 leaves were more polarizing than WT on the adaxial surfaces. The cer 6 and cer 8 mutations did not significantly affect polarization reflection. The impacts of Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV) infection on the polarization of reflected light were significantly affected by cer 5 mutation, with the reflections from cer 5 mutants being higher than those from WT leaves, suggesting that changes in CER 5 expression following infection could influence the polarization of the reflections. There was, however, no significant effect of the gl 1 mutation on polarization following TVCV infection. The cer 5 and gl 1 mutations did not affect the changes in polarization following Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection. The accumulation of TVCV and CMV did not differ significantly between mutant and WT leaves, suggesting that altered expression of surface structure genes does not significantly affect viral titres, raising the possibility that if such regulatory changes have any adaptive value it may possibly be through impacts on viral transmission...|$|R
40|$|Wolbachia pipientis {{bacteria}} are common endosymbionts of insects that are {{best known for}} their ability to increase their prevalence in populations by manipulating host reproductive systems. However, there are examples of Wolbachia that exist in nature that seem to induce no reproductive parasitism trait and yet are able to invade populations. We demonstrate a fitness benefit for Wolbachia-infected insects that may explain this paradox. Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with Wolbachia are less susceptible to mortality induced by a range of RNA viruses. The antiviral protection associated with Wolbachia infection might be exploited in future strategies to reduce <b>transmission</b> of pathogens <b>by</b> <b>insects.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} (LSD) is an {{economically}} important and debilitating disease of cattle {{caused by the}} {{lumpy skin disease virus}} (LSDV), a poxvirus in the genus Capripoxvirus. The disease is of economic importance to farmers in endemic regions and is a major constraint to international trade in livestock and their products. It is characterised by fever, enlargement of superficial lymph nodes, loss of weight, inappetence, salivation, lachrymation and formation of eruptive circumscribed skin lesions. The quality of meat and milk are reduced; there is infertility due to reduced sperm quality, abortions and reduced calving rates. The hides are permanently scarred, thereby reducing their quality and trade may be affected following movement restrictions from affected areas. v Lumpy skin disease has the potential to become an emerging disease because of global climate change and changes in patterns of trade in animals and animal products. The disease has become endemic in Africa except in countries like Libya, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, where the disease has never been reported. It has also spread to the Middle East where outbreaks were first reported in Israel (1989), Kuwait (1991), Saudi Arabia (1990), Lebanon (1993), The United Arab Emirates (2000) and Oman (2010). In endemic areas, LSD outbreaks are common in summer. The persistence of LSDV between inter-epidemic periods has not been determined and there is no carrier state reported in either cattle or wild animals. Transmission of the disease has been associated with a high incidence of biting insects such as in wet conditions. The spread of LSD from Egypt to Israel e. g. was associated with movement of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans. The virus has been recovered from S. calcitrans and Biomya fasciata, caught while feeding on infected animals and <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> <b>insects</b> is suspected to be mechanical, which has been demonstrated in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. During the 1957 outbreak of LSD in Kenya, affected animals were observed to have high tick infestations, especially of Amblyomma species. In a pilot trial in 2008 at the University of Pretoria (UP), Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases (DVTD), Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. (B) decoloratus ticks were implicated in the transmission of LSDV. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the vector competence of three common sub-Saharan tick species (R. (B) decoloratus, R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum) and their potential roles in the epidemiology of LSD. This was achieved by testing for persistence of LSDV in ticks and its subsequent transmission to recipient animals following interrupted feeding, transstadial and transovarial development of the ticks. The over-wintering of LSDV was also investigated during transstadial passage in A. hebraeum and transovarial passage in R. (B) decoloratus. During the study, seven cattle were artificially infected with LSDV to serve as source (donors) of infection to ticks. To test for mechanical / intrastadial transmission and persistence in ticks, adult ticks (A. hebraeum and R. appendiculatus) were partially fed on donor animals and then transferred to recipient animals or collected for testing. To test for transstadial transmission/passage, nymphal stages of A. hebraeum and R. appendiculatus were fed on donor animals until they engorged and dropped. Engorged nymphs were incubated to moult to adults. The emergent adults were placed on recipient animals and also tested for the virus. To test for transovarial transmission and passage R. (B) decoloratus (one- host tick) larvae were fed on donor animals until engorged adults. For R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum (three-host ticks), adults were fed to repletion on the donor animals. Engorged females were collected and incubated to lay eggs and the eggs were allowed to hatch. The emergent larvae were placed to feed on recipient animals to test for transovarial transmission, while larvae were tested for the presence of the virus. Over-wintering of LSDV in ticks was tested by transstadial passage in A. hebraeum and transovarial passage in R. (B) decoloratus under fluctuating reduced temperatures, simulating wintery climatic conditions. Engorged A. hebraeum nymphs and R. (B) decoloratus females were infected by intracoelomic injection. The presence of the virus in LSDV- infected animals was tested by real-time PCR, virus isolation (VI), and the serum neutralisation test (SNT). Tick saliva was tested by real-time PCR and VI while ticks were tested by immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, VI and real-time PCR. Mechanical/intrastadial and transstadial transmission is reported in A. hebraeum and R. appendiculatus. Transovarial transmission was reported in A. hebraeum, R. appendiculatus and R. (B) decoloratus. The virus was demonstrated in saliva and tick organs of A. hebraeum and R. appendiculatus adults following both mechanical/intrastadial and transstadial persistence. Transovarial passage of LSDV was demonstrated in R. (B) decoloratus, R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum larvae. The virus also persisted through cold temperature exposure during transstadial passage in A. hebraeum and transovarial passage in R. appendiculatus. This study confirms the vector competency of A. hebraeum, R. appendiculatus and R. (B) decoloratus ticks for LSDV. It also shows the potential for LSDV to over-winter in ticks and demonstrates that LSDV may persist in ticks during inter-epidemic periods.

40|$|Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is {{transmitted}} from plant to plant through a seemingly simple interaction with insect vectors. This process involves an aphid receptor and two viral proteins, P 2 and P 3. P 2 binds to both the aphid receptor and P 3, itself tightly associated with the virus particle, with the ensemble forming a transmissible viral complex. Here, we describe the conformations of both unliganded CaMV P 3 protein and its virion-associated form. X-ray crystallography revealed that the N-terminal domain of unliganded P 3 is a tetrameric parallel coiled coil with a unique organization showing two successive four-stranded subdomains with opposite supercoiling handedness stabilized by a ring of interchain disulfide bridges. A structural model of virus-liganded P 3 proteins, folding as an antiparallel coiled-coil network coating the virus surface, was derived from molecular modeling. Our results highlight the structural and biological versatility of this coiled-coil structure and provide {{new insights into the}} molecular mechanisms involved in CaMV acquisition and <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> the <b>insect</b> vector...|$|R
40|$|Acquisition and <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> an <b>insect</b> vector {{is central}} to the {{infection}} cycle of the majority of plant pathogenic viruses. Plant viruses can interact with their insect host {{in a variety of ways}} including both non-persistent and circulative transmission, in some cases, the latter involves virus replication in cells of the insect host. Replicating viruses can also elicit both innate and specific defense responses in the insect host. A consistent feature is that the interaction of the virus with its insect host/vector requires specific molecular interactions between virus and host, commonly via proteins. Understanding the interactions between plant viruses and their insect host can underpin approaches to protect plants from infection by interfering with virus uptake and transmission. Here, we provide a perspective focused on identifying novel approaches and research directions to facilitate control of plant viruses by better understanding and targeting virus-insect molecular interactions. We also draw parallels with molecular interactions in insect vectors of animal viruses, and consider technical advances for their control that may be more broadly applicable to plant virus vectors...|$|R
40|$|The Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) is {{an incurable}} disease {{caused by a}} virus {{belonging}} to the genus of the AIDS virus (Lentivirus, family Retroviridae). EIA has a high prevalence in the Brazilian Pantanal and recently Borges at al. [1] have found highly distinct values for the disease prevalence in non-flooded and flooded farm areas, which are 0. 85 % and 42. 10 %, respectively. This phenomenon has been credited to a much higher population of the insect vector, the horseflies (Tabanus sp.), on wetlands when coupled with warm temperatures. Based on the literature we redefined {{the values of the}} model parameters presented in [2], emphasizing the probability of EIA <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> the <b>insect</b> vector. From simulation scenarios we showed that the high prevalence of the disease could not be attributed only to horseflies. In fact, we found that the insect vector has an almost negligible role in the disease transmission process and we concluded {{that it is necessary to}} examine carefully the management of animals in the flooded regions. 201...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma vivax is {{transmitted}} to domestic livestock by tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) after cyclical {{development in the}} vector (cyclical transmission) as well as directly (mechanical <b>transmission)</b> <b>by</b> other bloodsucking <b>insects</b> such as horse-flies and stable-flies (Hoare, 1947; Wells, 1972). Thus the distribution of T. vivax extends beyond that of tsetse flies in Africa, and it also occurs in Mauritius, West Indies, and Central and South America into which the parasite has been introduced from Africa with infected cattle (Hoare, 1972). By contrast, T. congolense and T. brucei brucei are endemic only in tsetse infested areas of Africa. Studies were therefore carried out to determine whether G. morsitans centralis can transmit mechanically T. vivax, T. congolense or T. b. brucei from infected to uninfected goats through interrupted feeds...|$|R
40|$|Brucella spp. are facultative {{intracellular}} Gram-negative coccobacilli {{responsible for}} brucellosis, a worldwide zoonosis. We observed that Brucella melitensis {{is able to}} persist for several weeks {{in the blood of}} intraperitoneally infected mice and that transferred blood at any time point tested is able to induce infection in naive recipient mice. Bacterial persistence in the blood is dramatically impaired by specific antibodies induced following Brucella vaccination. In contrast to Bartonella, the type IV secretion system and flagellar expression are not critically required for the persistence of Brucella in blood. ImageStream analysis of blood cells showed that following a brief extracellular phase, Brucella is associated mainly with the erythrocytes. Examination by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy formally demonstrated that B. melitensis is able to invade erythrocytes in vivo. The bacteria do not seem to multiply in erythrocytes and are found free in the cytoplasm. Our results open up new areas for investigation and should serve in the development of novel strategies for the treatment or prophylaxis of brucellosis. Invasion of erythrocytes could potentially protect the bacterial cells from the host's immune response and hamper antibiotic treatment and suggests possible Brucella <b>transmission</b> <b>by</b> bloodsucking <b>insects</b> in nature.
