5|$|The {{student body}} of Queen's is {{represented}} by two students' unions, the Alma Mater Society (AMS) for all undergraduate students and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students for graduate and professional students. The AMS of Queen's University is the oldest undergraduate student government in Canada. The AMS recognizes more than 200 student clubs and organizations. All accredited extracurricular organizations at Queen's fall {{under the jurisdiction of}} either the AMS, or the Society of Graduate and Professional Students. The organizations and clubs accredited at Queen's cover a wide range of interests including academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation. The oldest accredited club at Queen's is the Queen's Debating Union, which was formed in 1843 as <b>the</b> <b>Dialectic</b> Society. <b>The</b> <b>Dialectic</b> Society served as a form of student government, until the AMS was formed from <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> society in 1858. The Queen's Bands is a student marching band founded in 1905, which claims to be the largest and oldest student marching band in Canada. Fraternities and sororities have been banned at the university, since a ruling made by the AMS in 1933. The ruling was passed in response to the formation of two fraternities in the 1920s. No accredited sororities have ever existed at Queen's.|$|E
5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. <b>The</b> <b>dialectic</b> structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with <b>the</b> <b>dialectic,</b> Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
50|$|Losev wrote eight {{monograph}} volumes, {{beginning the}} work in 1923. The titles were: The Ancient Cosmos and Modern Science, The Philosophy of Name, <b>The</b> <b>Dialectics</b> of Artistic Form, <b>The</b> <b>Dialectics</b> of Number in Plotinus, Criticism of Platonism by Aristotle, Music as a Subject of Logic, Essays on Classical Symbolism and Mythology, and <b>The</b> <b>Dialectics</b> of Myth. <b>The</b> series was to conclude with a ninth volume but <b>The</b> <b>Dialectics</b> of Myth caused {{a great deal of}} controversy, and Losev never finished the final monograph.|$|R

5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence is a part of <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dialectic</b> Society, {{along with}} the Glasgow University Medico-Chirurgical Society and Glasgow University Athletic Club, {{was one of the}} {{founding}} societies of the Glasgow University Union in 1885, as well as being instrumental in establishing the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council the following year, and remains an active contributor to the activities of both organisations. The GUU was originally an all-male organisation, having been established before the admission of women to the University in 1892. At this time, women were educated at Queen Margaret College, and opportunities for women students to debate existed at the Queen Margaret Union. This activity largely ceased following the admission of women to the GUU in 1980, however <b>the</b> <b>Dialectic</b> Society has recently been involved in a number of events aimed at its revival.|$|E

25|$|Negative dialectics {{comprises}} {{a monument}} {{to the end of the}} tradition of the individual subject as the locus of criticism. Without a revolutionary working class, the Frankfurt School had no one to rely on but the individual subject.

25|$|The {{first and}} most famous Constructivist {{architectural}} project was the 1919 proposal for {{the headquarters of the}} Comintern in St Petersburg by the Futurist Vladimir Tatlin, often called Tatlin's Tower. Though it remained unbuilt, the materials—glass and steel—and its futuristic ethos and political slant (the movements of its internal volumes were meant to symbolise revolution and <b>the</b> <b>dialectic)</b> {{set the tone for the}} projects of the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Marx thus {{extensively}} {{relied on}} a form of dialectical analysis. This method—to know the truth by uncovering the contradictions in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations {{to which they are}} linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of <b>the</b> <b>dialectic</b> (i.e. class consciousness) of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.|$|E
