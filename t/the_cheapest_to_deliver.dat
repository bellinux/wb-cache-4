40|$|Intermittent {{preventive}} treatment for malaria in children (IPTc) involves {{the administration of}} a full course of an anti-malarial treatment to children under 5 years old at specified time points {{regardless of whether or}} not they are known to be infected, in areas where malaria transmission is seasonal. It is important to determine the costs associated with IPTc delivery via community based volunteers and also the potential savings to health care providers and caretakers due to malaria episodes averted as a consequence of IPTc. Two thousand four hundred and fifty-one children aged 3 - 59 months were randomly allocated to four groups to receive: three days of artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) monthly, three days of AS+AQ bimonthly, one dose of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) bi-monthly or placebo. This paper focuses on incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the three IPTc drug regimens as delivered by community based volunteers (CBV) in Hohoe, Ghana compared to current practice, i. e. case management in the absence of IPTc. Financial and economic costs from the publicly funded health system perspective are presented. Treatment costs borne by patients and their caretakers are also estimated to present societal costs. The costs and effects of IPTc during the intervention period were considered with and without a one year follow up. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for uncertainty. Economic costs per child receiving at least the first dose of each course of IPTc show SP bimonthly, at US$ 8. 19, is <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver,</b> followed by AS+AQ bimonthly at US$ 10. 67 and then by AS+AQ monthly at US$ 14. 79. Training, drug delivery and supervision accounted for approximately 20 - 30 % each of total unit costs. During the intervention period AS & AQ monthly was the most cost effective IPTc drug regimen at US$ 67. 77 (61. 71 - 74. 75, CI 95 %) per malaria case averted based on intervention costs only, US$ 64. 93 (58. 92 - 71. 92, CI 95 %) per malaria case averted once the provider cost savings are included and US$ 61. 00 (54. 98, 67. 99, CI 95 %) when direct household cost savings are also taken into account. SP bimonthly was US$ 105. 35 (75. 01 - 157. 31, CI 95 %) and AS & AQ bimonthly US$ 211. 80 (127. 05 - 399. 14, CI 95 %) per malaria case averted based on intervention costs only. The incidence of malaria in the post intervention period was higher in children who were < 1 year old when they received AS+AQ monthly compared to the placebo group leading to higher cost effectiveness ratios when one year follow up is included. The cost per child enrolled fell considerably when modelled to district level as compared to those encountered under trial conditions. We demonstrate how cost-effective IPTc is using three different drug regimens and the possibilities for reducing costs further if the intervention was to be scaled up to the district level. The need for effective training, drug delivery channels and supervision to support a strong network of community based volunteers is emphasised...|$|E

However, even pools with apparently identical characteristics often exhibit markedly different prepayment behavior. The sources of this heterogeneity may be unobservable, but we can infer information about a pool from its prepayment behavior over time.

Knowledge of these prices is important both for portfolio valuation and for determining <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> pool <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> when selling mortgage-backed securities.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that interest rate futures are not directly correlated with the market interest rates. When one enters into an interest rate futures contract (like a bond future), the trader has ability to eventually take delivery of the underlying asset. In the case of notes and bonds this means the trader could potentially take delivery of a bunch of bonds if the contract is not cash settled. The bonds which the seller can deliver vary depending on the futures contract. The seller can choose <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a variety of bonds to the buyer that fit the definitions laid out in the contract. The futures contract price takes this into account, therefore prices have less to do with current market interest rates, and more to do with what existing bonds in <b>the</b> market are <b>cheapest</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> buyer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a broad empirical {{examination of the}} interactions between cash and derivatives markets for government bonds in the core euro area countries (Germany, France and Italy) {{in the aftermath of}} the launch of the third stage of European monetary union (EMU). Since the launch of the euro, liquidity in derivatives markets has concentrated in a handful of capital market futures contracts, in particular those traded on Eurex. The tremendous level of activity in Eurex contracts has raised concerns about the risk of a shortage in <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bond <b>to</b> <b>deliver.</b> <b>The</b> paper assesses cash market-, repo market- and futures market-based approaches to preventing such shortages, and finds that a combination of approaches is preferable. The paper goes on to analyse how changes in liquidity and trading activity in government bond markets since the start of EMU have affected price formation. Based on the conceptual framework set out by the financial market microstructure and asset market equilibrium literature, econometric evidence on the determinants of yield spreads is presented. The results confirm that fluctuations in yield spreads across euro government bonds contain a significant transitory component, which could represent temporary deviations from fundamental values. This “mispricing ” component increased at the time of the Russian and LTCM financial crises and peaked around the launch of the euro. Based on the size of the estimated mispricing component in bond yields, liquidity in euro government bond markets returned to pre- 1998 levels during 2000. Moreover, liquidity conditions appeared to converge across the G 5 countries, although UK and US bond markets maintained a positive liquidity differential with respect to euro area markets. Among euro area government securities markets, prices appear to be least distorted, and liquidity closest to that of the UK and US markets, in Italy's cash market, perhaps reflecting the advantages of an advanced trading infrastructure. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{papers in}} this volume analyse recent changes in the world's major fixed income markets. The {{introduction}} of the euro, structural changes in governments' fiscal positions, traumatic {{events such as the}} global financial market crisis of 1998, and advances in the technology of trading platforms are reshaping fixed income markets in Europe, Japan and the United States. The first paper provides a broad overview of the changes under way, and the following four papers elaborate on {{some of the issues that}} emerge. These papers complement a report published by the Committee on the Global Financial System in March 2001 on the use of collateral in wholesale financial markets. Taken together, the papers {{in this volume}} highlight the growing importance of private sector debt instruments. Falling supply and shifts in the mix of investors holding government securities are draining liquidity from some government securities markets, in particular the US Treasury and UK gilt markets. In contrast, non-government markets have seen issuance volumes soar, a greater diversity of instruments made available, and liquidity conditions improve at least for the largest bond issues. The paper by Mastroeni describes the development of one of the fastest growing segments of non-government securities market: Pfandbrief-style products in the euro market. Investors have accommodated changes in the relative borrowing patterns of the government and non-government sectors by moving towards more diversified portfolios. A key challenge faced by portfolio managers is pricing and managing the credit risk that they thereby take on. The paper by Hattori, Koyama and Yonetani examines the pricing of credit risk in the yen corporate bond market. They find that default risk, the stability of the financial system and the level of new corporate bond issuance relative to government bond issuance are the most important determinants of credit spreads in Japan. Demand for fixed income instruments in recent years has also been affected by changes in hedging and arbitrage activity. The 1998 crisis led to a reassessment of risk management practices, one outcome of which was a switch away from the exclusive use of government bonds as hedging vehicles in favour of a wider array of instruments. Other traumatic events, such as squeezes in German government bond futures contracts, reinforced this search for alternative hedging vehicles. Schulte and Violi examine interactions between cash and derivatives markets in the euro area, and assess ways to alleviate the risk of a shortage in <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bond <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> into a futures contract. Each market participant who switches to using non-government instruments as hedges subtracts liquidity from the government market and adds it to other markets, in the process raising the incentive for other market participants to follow suit. As non-government instruments gain liquidity, they are increasingly being used to price and hedge other securities and perform other functions for which government securities tended to be used in the past. The paper by Cooper and Scholtes concludes that declining supplies of government paper have helped to depress US Treasury and UK gilt yields below risk-free interest rates and so diminished their usefulness as benchmarks. They then demonstrate that interest rate swaps appear to have become the de facto benchmark for pricing high-quality bonds. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} applies architectural {{ideas of}} mass-customised difference and repetition, and tests them within the engineering paradigm of very tall timber buildings – taller than {{have ever been}} erected {{in the history of}} architecture. According to Edward Glaeser’s book, Triumph of <b>the</b> City, <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> way <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> new housing (at least in the USA) is in theform of mass-produced two-storey homes, which typically cost only about $ 84 per square foot to erect. While building up is more costly, many of the costs – such as hiring a fancy, big-name architect – are fixed and won’t increase with the height of the building. In fact, once you’ve reached a height of about seven floors, building up has its own economic logic, since those fixed costs can be spread over more living units, writes Glaeser, before continuing: “The actual marginal cost of adding an extra square foot of living space at the topof a skyscraper in New York is typically less than $ 400 ”. If to this we add all the financial advantages of using stacked structures made from engineered timber – lower construction costs due to the simple geometry, and the speed oferection (four men built the nine stories of our primary precedent, the Stadthaus building in London, in nine weeks, reducing the entire building process from 72 weeks to 49); larger savings on the entire building (again, the Stadthaus came in at 15 percent less expensive than a concrete equivalent); and lower costs for transportation and foundations due to the lighterweight of the material – it soon becomes clear that timber developments make financial sense. Timber can also be precisely incorporated into different proprietary building systems: throughout this project, the systems of three Swedish manufacturers (Martinsons, Moelven, and Byggma) are used as structural frameworks. The trio of multi-storey timber buildings isbased on conceptual notions of stacking, cutting, and slotting, respectively. These simple formal ideas (a variation on Deleuze’s thoughts on difference and repetition) are interpreted to align with the fundamental material logic of wood, {{as well as with the}} specific ramifications of these existing timber building systems. Methodologically, these buildings utilise a primary organisational principle to inform its volumetric massing, circulatory planning, arrangement of living units, fenestration configuration, and so on, while allowing for other principles to guide further aspects so as to avoid what Reiser + Umemoto call The Abuse of the Diagram: “Any one organizational model has limits. The ambition to carry a diagram through all levels of a single architecturalproject is exhaustive and reductive. To have one model determine all aspects of design is to simplify what is in reality a richer, more heterogeneous complexity. A true multiplicity requires that many different models be coordinated. A single model relentlessly deployed at all scales emerges as merely formal. ”Having said that, an initial investigation into simple formal moves at the outset of a project often yields a plethora of potential trajectories created by the self-imposed constraints that are carried through by the limiting conceptual framework we choose to adopt. There appears to be a certain psychology of limitation that are highly beneficial for devising new ideas, be theyformal, spatial, or haptically driven. As neuroscience journalist Jonah Lehrer puts it in his book Imagine: How Creativity Works: “ [...] . the imagination is unleashed by constraints. You break out of the box by stepping into shackles”.
