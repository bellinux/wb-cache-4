More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E

25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

25|$|Moltmann relates {{his views}} on the trinity to three modes of human freedom. The first mode is the {{political}} meaning of freedom as supremacy. This mode is rejected by Moltmann, who sees it as corresponding to a God who rules over his creation, which exists merely to serve Him. It is a relation of a subject with an object, where {{the goal is to}} enhance the supremacy of the subject. The second mode of human freedom is the socio-historical and Hegelian meaning of freedom as communion, which implies the relation between two subjects. This relationship aims at love and solidarity, and corresponds to the perichoresis of the Father and Son, and through the Son the children of God, or humanity. This relationship is both liberating and loving, and is one Moltmann favors. The third mode of human freedom is the implicitly religious concept of freedom as the passion of the creature for his or her potential. This deals with the relationship between subjects and their common future project. This is the mode favored most by Moltmann, who correlates this relationship with the one humans share with God {{in the realm of the}} Holy Spirit. Here, an indwelling of the Spirit allows humans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> God. As you can see, the first mode of freedom is political, and focuses on The Father; the second is communal, focusing on the Son; and the third is religious, focusing on the Spirit.|$|E

25|$|While serving {{prison time}} {{together}} in 1990, Merlino met Ralph Natale. Natale {{was an older}} mobster who used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> deceased boss Angelo Bruno. It was in prison with Natale that Merlino first discussed taking over the Philadelphia family. The plan was for Merlino to start a war {{for control of the}} crime family, then have Natale named boss when he was released {{with the support of the}} Genovese crime family. When Merlino was released from prison, he recruited his best friend Michael Ciancaglini and his other childhood friends into the plan. Stanfa was aware of the divide in his family and tried to find a peaceful solution. He named Michael's older brother Joseph, Jr., as his new underboss. Stanfa hoped that this would appease the Merlino faction and bring them under his banner. However, tensions escalated and by 1992 another war for control of the Philadelphia crime family was underway. Merlino loyalists shot and incapacitated Joseph Ciancaglini, Jr. while Stanfa's faction killed Merlino's top lieutenant Michael Ciancaglini. They continued attacking each other for months, including a freeway ambush Stanfa survived and several failed attempts on Merlino's life. Being the boss of the Philadelphia crime family, Stanfa had a larger army at his command and also recruited a lot of outside hitmen to fight in the war. The Merlino/Natale faction was much smaller, but was just as ruthless. They allied with other Philadelphia criminal organizations including the Pagan's Motorcycle Club and the Junior Black Mafia while also convincing some members of the Philadelphia crime family to switch sides.|$|E

500|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Lusitania in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it {{difficult}} to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent. He again contacted Booth, who again claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> David Lloyd George and his secretary, Christopher Addison, and said that if Gruban put Booth on the Board of Directors he could [...] "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like". Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took £400 on expenses. He then claimed that this was not enough money for the work he did, and he should get a secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the [...] "Birmingham Contract". The contract was worth £6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have £580 or £600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the wastepaper basket. From that point onwards Booth worked {{as hard as he could}} to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.|$|E

500|$|A {{specialist}} in hematology and oncology, and clinical {{professor at the}} New York University Medical Center, {{she was one of}} the first in the United States to recognize the appearance of the AIDS epidemic. While working in private practice in New York City, she observed a sudden increase in the number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma—a rare cancer that would later be identified as an AIDS-defining illness—in young gay men with immune deficiencies. With Alvin Friedman-Kien, a dermatologist, she co-authored the first published article on the appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men. The first patient she diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, in 1979, was a gay man with a generalized rash and enlarged lymph nodes; two weeks later, a colleague asked her to see a second patient, another gay man, with the same disease. Both men turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> Gaëtan Dugas—often called the [...] "patient zero" [...] of HIV/AIDS in North America (though more recent studies suggest otherwise)—who the men told Laubenstein had a similar rash. In 1981, when Dugas, a Canadian, heard about Kaposi's sarcoma, he traveled to New York from Montreal to consult with Laubenstein and Friedman-Kien and visited their practice for monthly chemotherapy treatments. By 1982, Laubenstein had treated 62 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. She later left her university position to focus on treating AIDS patients in her private practice.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with...</b> She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E
