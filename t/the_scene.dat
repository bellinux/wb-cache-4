5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> where Donna and the Doctor {{investigate}} Adipose {{was difficult}} to film. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> took thirty shots to complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> was filmed in Picture Finance's call centre {{on the outskirts of}} Newport on an early Sunday morning, with the company's telephonists serving as extras.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> where Saul Tigh has {{the vision}} of {{shooting}} William Adama was not filmed in one shot, but was edited {{in such a way}} that the cut would only become noticeable if one looks at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> closely.

5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E
5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} The Argentine, Soderbergh depicts Guevara's {{derailment}} of {{a freight}} train during the Battle of Santa Clara. In filming the sequence, Soderbergh balked at the digital effects solution and managed to reallocate $500,000 from the overall $58 million budget to build a real set of tracks and a train powered by two V-8 car engines. To film <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> they had six rehearsals, and could only shoot <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> once.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin then cast Florence D. Lee as the Blind Girl's {{grandmother}} and shot scenes with Cherrill and Lee for five weeks. In late 1929, Chaplin re-shot the first Flower Shop scene with Cherrill. This time, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> {{was completed in}} six days and Chaplin was happy with Cherrill's performance. Chaplin had been shooting the film {{for a year and}} was only a little more than half way finished. From March to April 1930, Chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaire's house at the Town House on Wilshire Boulevard. He hired Joe Van Meter and Albert Austin, whom he had known since his days working for Fred Karno, as the burglars. In the late spring of 1930, Chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence: the boxing match. Chaplin hired Keystone actor Hank Mann to play the Tramp's opponent. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> required 100 extras and Chaplin took four days to rehearse and six to shoot <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and was shot between June 23 and 30. Chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras. Over 100 extras were present. Chaplin’s performance in <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth {{his opinion}} of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> when {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that the suspense might be ruined if <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
