5000|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies is the Greek marginated tortoise, <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> marginata. Three additional subspecies of marginated tortoises {{have been}} named: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> is also {{closely related}} to the Greek or spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (Testudo graeca). Both have very similar bodily characteristics—oblong carapaces, large scales on the front legs, large coverings for the head and cone-like scales on the upper thighs, undivided tail coverings, moveable stomach plates, and lack of tail spikes. Presumably, <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> diverged from ancestral Testudo graeca as a population more suited for life in the mountainous regions. Evidence in favor of this is the wide geographical region and the extremely large number of subspecies of Testudo graeca, including a subspecies in Turkey with strongly bent carapace tiles, like the marginated tortoise. <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> on the other hand, despite the two subspecies, presents a much more unified appearance, which points toward an earlier appearance in evolutionary history. In captivity, the two species often cross-breed, but this should be avoided.|$|R
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, animals from northeastern Turkey are very robust, such as Hermann's tortoise. The largest {{specimens}} come from Bulgaria. Specimens of 7 kg have been reported. In comparison, the Tunisian tortoise has a maximum weight of 0.7 kg (1.5 lb). Testudo graeca is also {{closely related to}} the marginated tortoise (<b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata).</b> The two species can interbreed, producing offspring capable of reproduction.|$|R
5000|$|The spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (or Greek tortoise) (Testudo graeca) {{is one of}} five species of Mediterranean tortoise (genus Testudo, family Testudinidae). The other four species are the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii), Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni), and marginated tortoise (<b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata).</b> The {{spur-thighed tortoise}} is a very long lived animal, achieving a lifespan of upwards of 125 years, with some unverified reports of up to 200 years.|$|R
50|$|Rare amphibians, {{found only}} on the island, are the Sardinian brook salamander, brown cave salamander, {{imperial}} cave salamander, Monte Albo cave salamander, Supramonte cave salamander and Sarrabus cave salamander (Speleomantes sarrabusensis); the Sardinian tree frog {{is also found in}} Corsica and in the Tuscan Archipelago. Among reptiles worthy of note are Bedriaga's rock lizard, the Tyrrhenian wall lizard and Fitzinger's algyroides, endemic species of Sardinia and Corsica. The island is inhabited by terrestrial tortoises and sea turtles like Hermann's tortoise, the spur-thighed tortoise, marginated tortoise (<b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> sarda), Nabeul tortoise, loggerhead sea turtle and green sea turtle. A new arachnid species, endemic to the island, has been recently found: the Nuragic spider.|$|R
50|$|The marginated {{tortoise}} (<b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata)</b> is {{a species of}} tortoise found in Greece, Italy and the Balkans in southern Europe. It is the largest European tortoise, reaching a weight of up to 5 kg and a length of 35 cm. Its shell is oblong and has a notable thickness around {{the middle of the}} body. The posterior end of the shell has a saw-like formation, flanged outward like a bell. The carapaces of adult specimens are almost completely black, with yellow highlights. The front sides of the limbs are covered with large scales. The tail is notable for a lengthwise marking and for an undivided carapace over the tail. The {{marginated tortoise}} is herbivorous, and hibernates for the winter.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{information}} {{about the presence of}} three allochthonous reptiles species in Calabria: <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata,</b> Trachemys scripta elegans and Chamaeleo chamaeleon. The first one was found in three sites located in the Catena Costiera Massif and in the Crati Valley (Northern Calabria). The slider turtle was found in seven different sites throughout all the region. It massively colonised the Angitola artificial lake: here, this turtle lives in natural conditions and its reproduction was confirmed by the presence of nests, eggs and hatchlings. C. chamaeleon is present in sandy coastal habitats near Palmi and Gioia Tauro (Southern Calabria). From a conservationistic point of view, serious damages to autochtonous species could be caused by the spreading of T. scripta elegans : this species has already determined the local extinction of Angitola’s Emys orbicularis populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904) infections {{were found}} in 14 % (n = 14) of Testudo graeca Lin-naeus, 1758 {{tortoises}} in Bulgaria and in 92 % (n = 26) of those in Turkey. Hemolivia mauritanica-like gametocytes {{were found in}} 81 % (n = 47) of wild <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> Schoepff, 1792 tortoises in Greece. Parasitaemia intensity (the percent-age of infected red blood cells found in approximately 104 cells) was 0. 03 – 22. 4 % in T. graeca and 0. 06 – 12. 27 % in T. marginata. On the other hand, all blood samples from 40 Bulgarian, 38 Greek, and 18 Croatian specimens of Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789 were negative. Little {{is known about the}} occurrence of Hemolivia mauri-tanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904) all over the wide range of its type host (Brumpt 1938), despite its century-old description from an Algerian specimen of the spur-thighed tortois...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidiosis is {{a disease}} caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium, which affect the {{gastrointestinal}} tract of humans and animals worldwide. In the present study, Cryptosporidium isolates from captive European tortoises (Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata)</b> in Italy were genetically characterised using gene/s encoding Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and/or the hypervariable segment internal to the SSU rDNA. Six isolates from T. graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata revealed 100 % sequence identity with the zoonotic Cryptosporidium pestis (Cryptosporidium parvum 'bovine genotype'), while a sequence from one T. marginata was a unique uncharacterised genotype (Cryptosporidium sp. ex T. marginata). The new genotype is phylogenetically characterised as belonging to the intestinal cryptosporidial lineage. The present study indicates that tortoises may disseminate Cryptosporidium oocysts in the captive environment. The identification of the zoonotic genotype in the faeces of captive European tortoises indicates a potential risk for humans within the household...|$|R
40|$|To test phylogenetic {{relationships}} within the genus Testudo (Testudines: Testudinidae), we have sequenced {{a fragment of}} the mitochondrial (mt) 12 S rRNA gene of 98 tortoise specimens belonging to the genera Testudo, Indotestudo, and Geochelone. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods identify two main clades of Mediterranean tortoises, one composed of the species <b>Testudo</b> graeca, <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata,</b> and <b>Testudo</b> kleinmanni and a second of Testudo hermanni, Testudo horsfieldii, and Indotestudo elongata. The first clade, but not the second, was also supported by maximum parsimony analysis. Together with the genus Geochelone, a star-like radiation of these clades was suggested, as a sister-group {{relationship between the two}} Testudo clades could not be confirmed. The intraspecies genetic variation was examined by sequencing the mt 12 S rRNA fragment from 28 specimens of T. graeca and 49 specimens of T. hermanni from various geographic locations. Haplotype diversity was found to be significantly larger in T. graeca compared with T. hermanni, suggestive of reduced genetic diversity in the latter species, perhaps due to Pleistocene glaciations affecting northern and middle Europe or other sources of lineage reduction. No ancient mt 12 S rRNA gene haplotypes were identified in T. graeca and/or T. hermanni originating from islands in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that these islands harbor tortoise populations introduced from the European and African mainland.

40|$|<b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata,</b> {{the largest}} European land tortoise, is {{suffering}} habitat degradation and destruction. Some populations, in markedly degraded habitats, {{are characterized by}} divergent morphotypes. However, the evolutionary significance of these morphotypes is of debate. Using 11 polymorphic microsatellites, we studied: (1) marginated tortoises from Sardinia that display a divergent morphotype this population was potentially introduced from Greece; and (2) an area in the southern Peloponnese that includes a small and degraded zone in which marginated tortoises are dwarf. Genetic analyses run without any a priori assignment clearly acknowledge the specimens sampled in {{the territory of the}} dwarf form as a single group whilst Sardinian specimens are clustered with other specimens from {{the northern part of the}} area sampled in Greece. Demographic analyses suggest that Sardinian tortoises originated recently from some of the populations sampled in the northern part of the area sampled in Greece. Over locations sampled in Greece, a landscape-genetic analysis allowed us to detect potential landscape features that may reduce gene flow between the dwarf form territory and surrounding areas. Our results suggest that the territory of the dwarf form is particularly propitious for marginated tortoises and that conservation regulations in Greece should be reinforced to protect this area from increasing impact of human activities changing from traditional agriculture to mechanization and extensive use of chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cryptosporidiosis {{affects the}} {{gastrointestinal}} and respiratory tract of humans {{as well as}} {{of a wide range of}} companion, farm, laboratory and wild animals. In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and likely circulating in other reptile species as well. A new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly detected and genetically characterized in a marginated tortoise in Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> CrIT- 20. The phylogenetic analysis of this isolate indicated that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal clade. These findings were later on confirmed by the detection of genetic homologies of isolates from a python and a chameleon from Spain and by recent research in the United States. The latter study presented both the occurrence of intestinal lesions in a pancake tortoise and a Russian tortoise and the genetic characterization of the isolates, together with the first pictures of the endogenous stages of Cryptosporidium CrIT- 20. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences representing small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) of these isolates confirmed the pathological findings because this Cryptosporidium was related to the intestinal group and supported previous results in T. marginata from Italy. The present scientific data on the Cryptosporidium CrIT- 20 support its classification as a new species of Cryptosporidium causing intestinal diseases in tortoises. Although further morphological (i. e. exogenous stages) and biological aspects (i. e. complete host range) are yet to be elucidated, it is proposed that this Cryptosporidium is designated Cryptosporidium ducismarci. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{seasonal}} activity of the European terrestrial turtles, which can be kept in captivity. The following species have been dealt with: Testudo hermanni, <b>Testudo</b> graeca, <b>Testudo</b> <b>marginata</b> and <b>Testudo</b> horsfieldii. The analysis was supposed to confirm the hypothesis that the species that lives that the turtle species living in the north is also the species with the least requirements {{when it comes to the}} microclimatic conditions. The first chapter deals with the characteristics of these species. Both their Czech and Latin name is listed, the most famous subspecies classified, so are the most famous subspecies, the area where they occur is described and their appearance, including the typical features, what they feed on, how they reproduce, what conditions they require if they are to be bred and how endangered they are. The next part deals with the seasonal rhythms of the turtles. The year is divided into several seasons or phases, i. e. the post-hibernation phase, spring, summer, pre-hibernation phase and hibernation. In each phase there is a description of both the active and passive behaviour of the turtle and of the way this behaviour is influenced by the time of sunshine, air temperature, rainfall or other factors. Examples of specific turtle behaviour that has been observed in different areas of the Mediterranean Sea, where they can be observed in the nature are given. What follows is a general characteristics of the hibernation and estivation and an explanation of the difference between the two. The next chapter deals with the conditions for the turtle hibernation as a part of the breeding process, such as the preparation of the turtles for the hibernation and the ways to help them do so safely in our country. Some of the turtle keepers' opinions on this important subject, the right way of hibernation can influence other important physiological processes of the turtles are mentioned. Then the recommended conditions for turtle breeding in our country are described. The final chapter is charted information about the chosen turtle species (the size of the shell, the height above the sea level in which they occurr, whether they hibernate or estivate and whether they are listed in the Red Book of Endangered Species and the CITES lists. The analysis of the informaton that has been collected shows that the hypothesis that was formulated in the beginning of the thesis can be almost confirmed and that the Testudo hermanni seems to be species that is the easiest to breed indeed...|$|R
