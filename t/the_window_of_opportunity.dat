The Konbaung armies seized the upper Tenasserim coast following the Burmese-Siamese War (1759–1760), and pushed out the Mon resistance farther down the coast. (Alaungpaya died in the war.) The resistance was driven out of Tenasserim in 1765 when Alaungpaya's son Hsinbyushin seized the lower coastline as part of the Burmese-Siamese War (1765–1767).|$|E

Even {{if she were}} to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E
25|$|After the {{surrender}} of the Batavian squadron on 30 August, the British fleet had become master not just of the North Sea, {{but also of the}} Zuider Zee. Remarkably, the British had not made use of this advantage (and of the psychological consequences of {{the surrender}} for Batavian morale) to force the issue, for instance by making an amphibious landing near Amsterdam. General Krayenhoff, who at the time was in charge of improvising the defences of that city, points out that for a few days Amsterdam lay quite defenseless against such an attack. In his opinion the campaign might have ended then and there. The British fleet had remained strangely passive. This changed {{in the days after the}} Battle of Bergen when the British belatedly occupied the undefended ports of Medemblik, Enkhuizen, and Hoorn, at the same time mastering the West Friesland region between these ports.

40|$|Based on a {{previous}} content analysis work, there is nowadays a need for assessing a list of strategies related to the management of supply chains and logistics discipline, such as postponement, customisation, centralisation/decentralisation, etc. The need for environmental assessment of these strategies stems from the challenging necessity for bridging two fields: logistics/supply chain management field, and the environmental field. Equally important, a cumulating experience from performing such assessments would hopefully enhance the ability of assessing complex issues such as E-commerce within a framework of a recent, novel model of assessment – ‘the horizontal assessment’. The ultimate {{purpose of this paper}} is to discuss <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> environmental assessment of these strategies.

Early in December plans were thrown into doubt as the government announced that it had 'delayed' the unitary bids for Ipswich and Exeter. In July 2008 the Boundary Committee announced its preferred option was for a unitary authority covering Ipswich and the south eastern corner of Suffolk, including Felixstowe.|$|E

However, in drylands, cumulative monthly or annual precipitation typically fails to predict decomposition. In these systems, <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> for decomposer activity may rather depend on the precipitation frequency and local factors affecting litter desiccation, such as soil-litter mixing. We used a full-factorial microcosm experiment to disentangle {{the relative importance of}} cumulative precipitation, pulse frequency, and soil-litter mixing on litter decomposition. Decomposition, measured as litter carbon loss, saturated with increasing cumulative precipitation when pulses were large and infrequent, suggesting that litter moisture no longer increased and/or microbial activity was no longer limited by water availability above a certain pulse size. More frequent precipitation pulses led to increased decomposition at high levels of cumulative precipitation. Soil-litter mixing consistently increased decomposition, with greatest relative increase (+ 194 %) under the driest conditions. Collectively, our results highlight the need to consider precipitation at finer temporal scale and incorporate soil-litter mixing as key driver of decomposition in drylands...|$|R
