5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> <b>her</b> way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

Too nervous to talk to her, the man, who had stolen some sausages for his deranged, sausage-obsessed father (Thompson), leaves <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> doorstep anonymously. Knowing he can never lead a normal life while caring for his gibbering idiot father, he resigns himself to loneliness.|$|E

May sketched birds, rode on donkeys and ponies, and, in addition to touring and camping, attended a performance of Aida at the Khedivial Opera House and roamed the gardens and rooms of Inji Hanimefendi's palace.|$|E

It was Varesco who planted <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

This was the first intimation she had of her danger, and she at once screamed out, and rolling herself on the ground, tried to put out the fire in that way.

2500|$|After {{several years}} of {{retirement}} from the fashion industry, French designer Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Knowles was attracted with {{his work at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, [...] "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" [...] (2008), where several of his haute couture pieces were on display. Knowles immediately {{fell in love with the}} costumes and wanted to use <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> tour after her mother and designer Tina Knowles influenced her decision. She met with Mugler in Paris in September and started exchanging ideas with him, further designing costumes which were inspired by her love of music and life. She hired him as the designer for the tour costumes in November, 2008. Speaking about her collaboration, Knowles said, [...] "The best part about this tour is I'm working with Thierry Mugler, who is an icon and a legend, and I've been a fan." [...] Mugler wanted to capture the duality between being a woman and a warrior and understand these two sides with [...] own perception of both aspects while creating the costumes for Knowles and using the words [...] "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" [...] as inspiration. He felt, [...] "Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality. On stage, there is Sasha Fierce and there is Beyoncé in her truest self." [...] He described the costumes as [...] "very elaborate" [...] and rooted in the songs' meanings. He conducted a 71-piece wardrobe for Knowles, her dancers and the band for the tour. For the shows, Knowles had ten different looks which were noted to be [...] "fierce" [...] as her onstage alter ego. She wore [...] "ferocious power-glam superheroine outfits for a one-two punch of femininity and fierceness". American fashion designer Chris March also collaborated with Knowles during the tour helping Mugler in the process of creating the costumes and making them usable for stage purposes as his expertise was execution of outfits. On July 23, 2009, March filled a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Knowles' look captured a duality of soft and hard, combining bows with metal and incorporating fishnets, mismatched gloves and power shoulders into costumes that mirror Knowles' lyrics about [...] "all the single women" [...] femme fatales and power brokers in a [...] "high-tech Blade Runner world" [...] as stated by Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the wardrobe designs consisted of a variety of gold sparkly leotards, all form-fitting, light-reflecting and leg-baring. Knowles also wore leopard-print pants and glow-in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body. Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times wrote that the singer donned a series of curve-hugging leotards and mile-high stilettos, which were revealing her legs.
