It has been observed that HenV defects with occupation from n = 2 He to n = 4 He bind helium equally strongly, but weaker than for HeV. For n ≥ 5 He the binding increases rapidly. The observed behaviour is attributed to helium induced trap mutation and agrees qualitatively with results of atomistic calculations in nickel for this case. Helium precipitation at near surface trapping sites is held responsible for the observed increase of helium release ternperatures with helium dose when an undamaged crystal is irradiated.

I suggest that the transition will be taken to occur when the ratio of the dynamical time scale to the the envelope thermal time scale, Q, reaches its maximum value. Time average values are used for the different quantities, as the criterion does not refer to the short time-scale variations occurring on the AGB and post-AGB, e. g., <b>thermal</b> pulses (<b>helium</b> shell flashes) and magnetic activity. Along the entire AGB the value of Q increases, even when the star starts to contract. Only when a rapid contraction starts does the value of Q start to decrease. This criterion captures the essence of the transition from the AGB to the post AGB phase, because Q is connected to the stellar effective temperature, reaching its maximum value at T~ 4000 - 6000 K, it is related to the mass loss properties, and it reaches its maximum value when rapid contraction starts and envelope mass is very low.

Control schemes for the sawtooth period have been published in the literature, but the systematic design of high-performance controllers (yielding accurate and fast convergent responses) has not been addressed. In this work, three control strategies for high-performance sawtooth control are presented using electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD). Both degrees of freedom of the ECCD actuator will be explored and combined with advanced controller designs. First, the ECCD deposition location is used as a control variable, for which a gain-scheduled feedback controller and static feedforward control is derived. Second, the use of the driven current as a control variable is explored, and a simple controller is designed based on the identified dynamics. In the third approach both control variables are joined in an overall controller design, which enables the combination of high-performance control of the sawtooth period and control of the gyrotron power.
