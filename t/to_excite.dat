5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster {{that can take}} a high polish, and which is so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> new and returning players and added more depth {{to do so and}} opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E

5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed <b>to</b> <b>excite</b> the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E

40|$|Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial License Two {{separate}} experimental {{searches for}} second-order weak nuclear decays <b>to</b> <b>excited</b> final states were conducted. Both experiments {{were carried out}} at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility to provide shielding from cosmic rays. The first search is for the 2 νββ decay of 96 Zr <b>to</b> <b>excited</b> final states of the daughter nucleus, 96 Mo. As a byproduct of this experiment, the β decay of 96 Zr was also investigated. Two coaxial high-purity germanium detectors were used in coincidence to detect γ rays produced by the daughter nucleus as it de-excited to the ground state. After collecting 1. 92 years of data with 17. 91 g of enriched 96 Zr, half-life limits {{at the level of}} 1020 yr were produced. Measurements of this decay are important to test 0 νββ-decay nuclear matrix element calculations, which are necessary to extract the neutrino mass from a measurement of the 0 νββ decay half-life.
