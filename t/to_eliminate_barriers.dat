From this perspective, the use of ICT – document and workflow management systems – is studied in four construction projects. The study shows that financial and interests' constraints, time constraints, knowledge constraints, and authority constraints impede actors in using ICT in the intended way. Most of the barriers to the intended use of interorganisational ICT can be traced back to the pre-usage phase. Based on the critical perspective, we formulate suggestions for change <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> these <b>barrier...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. CUDA is a data {{parallel}} programming model that supports several key abstractions- thread blocks, hierarchical memory and barrier synchronization- for writing applications. This model has proven effective in programming GPUs. In this paper we describe a framework called MCUDA, which allows CUDA programs {{to be executed}} efficiently on shared memory, multi-core CPUs. Our framework consists {{of a set of}} source-level compiler transformations and a runtime system for parallel execution. Preserving program semantics, the compiler transforms threaded SPMD functions into explicit loops, performs fission <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>barrier</b> synchronizations, and converts scalar references to threadlocal data to replicated vector references. We describe an implementation of this framework and demonstrate performance approaching that achievable from manually parallelized and optimized C code. With these results, we argue that CUDA can be an effective data-{{parallel programming}} model for more than just GPU architectures. ...|$|R
