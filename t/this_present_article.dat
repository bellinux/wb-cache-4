50|$|<b>This</b> <b>present</b> <b>article</b> {{is written}} from the {{viewpoint}} of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word adiabatic is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by Rankine. It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall. In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be adiabatic, though often far from isentropic, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall.|$|E
5000|$|They then {{proposed}} that [...] "it may {{be shown to}} follow that the condition for thermal equilibrium between several assemblies is the equality of a certain single-valued function of the thermodynamic states of the assemblies, which may be called the temperature t, {{any one of the}} assemblies being used as a [...] "thermometer" [...] reading the temperature t on a suitable scale. This postulate of the [...] "Existence of temperature" [...] could with advantage be known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics". The first sentence of <b>this</b> <b>present</b> <b>article</b> is a version of this statement. It is not explicitly evident in the existence statement of Fowler and Guggenheim that temperature refers to a unique attribute of a state of a system, such as is expressed in the idea of the hotness manifold.

5000|$|In {{the opinion}} of Schrödinger, [...] "It is now quite obvious in what manner you have to {{reformulate}} the law of entropy—or for that matter, all other irreversible statements—so that they be capable of being derived from reversible models. You must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two, which you may for the moment consider isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, but not always from each other." [...] The two systems are isolated from each other by the wall, until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation, as envisaged by the law. The thermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems. It is the cause of the irreversibility. The statement of the law in <b>this</b> <b>present</b> <b>article</b> complies with Schrödinger's advice. The cause-effect relation is logically prior to the second law, not derived from it.|$|E
