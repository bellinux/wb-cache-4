40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{analysis of}} possible use of alcohols for the feeding of self - ignition and spark-ignition engines {{operating in a}} dual- fuel mode, i. e. simultaneously combusting alcohol and diesel oil or alcohol and petrol. Issues associated with the requirements for application of bio-fuels were presented with taking into account National Index Targets, bio-ethanol production methods and dynamics of its production worldwide and in Poland. Te considerations are illustrated by results of the <b>tests</b> on spark- ignition and self- ignition engines fed with two fuels: petrol and methanol or diesel oil and methanol, respectively. <b>Te</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on a 1100 MPI Fiat four- cylinder engine with multi-point injection and a prototype collector fitted with additional injectors in each cylinder. <b>Te</b> other <b>tested</b> engine was a SW 680 six- cylinder direct- injection diesel engine. Influence of a methanol addition on basic operational parameters of the engines and exhaust gas toxicity were analyzed. <b>Te</b> <b>tests</b> showed a favourable influence of methanol on combustion process of traditional fuels and on some operational parameters of engines. An addition of methanol resulted in a distinct rise of total efficiency of both types of engines at maintained output parameters (maximum power and torque). In {{the same time a}} radical drop in content of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides in exhaust gas was observed at high shares of methanol in feeding dose of ZI (petrol) engine, and 2 - 3 fold lower smokiness in case of ZS (diesel) engine. Among unfavourable phenomena, a rather insignificant rise of CO and NOx content for ZI engine, and THC and NOx - for ZS engine, should be numbered. It requires to carry out further research on optimum control parameters of the engines. Conclusions drawn from this work may be used for implementation of bio-fuels to feeding the combustion engines...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of the {{therapeutic}} dissolution of urinary calculi it seems to be very necessary to clarify the organic components of them, the study of which has been scarcely reported. The organic components reported have been analyzed only by the methods of elementary analysis. Recently it's histochemical study has been also reported. The present paper reports the results of the qualitative analytical studies for the amorphous organic components of urinary calculi by the methods of biochemical analysis. 45 g of mixed powder of urinary calculi (from bladder 3, kidney 1 and mixed pieces of various calculi which were used for the previous experiments but the origin of them remains unknown) was extracted, each in a separated fraction, by agents in the following order successively: petroleum ether, ether, chloroform, alcohol, cold water, hot water, 1 % aqueous solution of HCl, 5 % that of NaOH and 5 % that of HC!. Then each of the extracts was treated by some chemical procedures such as distillation, vacaum distillation, neutralization, salting out and hydrolysis with HCI solution. All of these fractions were analyzed by usual biochemical qualitative methods as below. <b>Tests</b> for protein and amino acid: ninhydrin <b>test.</b> biuret <b>test.</b> Millon's <b>test.</b> Hopkis-Cole's <b>test.</b> Sakaguchi's <b>test.</b> Molisch's <b>test.</b> precipitation <b>test</b> by lead acetate, ferrocianide, picric acid, phosphotungustic acid, sulfosalicylic acid and alcohol. heat coagulation. saltion out by ammonium sulphate. <b>Tests</b> for carbohydrate: Benedict's <b>test.</b> Nylander's <b>test.</b> orcin-HCI <b>test.</b> diphenylamine <b>test.</b> Reduction <b>test</b> by Fehling's reagent. naphthoresorcin <b>test.</b> cysteine-H 2 S 04 <b>test.</b> <b>Tests</b> for lipoid: acrolein <b>test.</b> Salkowsky's <b>test.</b> precipitation <b>test</b> by cadmium chloride.
