Although having a fine service record, Sandford kept an informal atmosphere and sometimes lax discipline within his command. Units were also far below regimental quotas. Brigadier generals were late reporting for duty and he himself was very late organizing division formations on occasion. This often resulted in delays such as military parades being <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> overdue.

To represent the jungle {{of the alien}} planet, the soundstage was inundated with foliage. A Xindi landing pod was created to appear in those same scenes. Several of the main cast were required to undergo extended make-up sessions lasting <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> every day for six days of the shoot in order for their characters to appear {{in a number of}} different stages of mutation. The make-up on Jolene Blalock was not as extensive as that on Scott Bakula, Dominic Keating and Linda Park due to her character's Vulcan anatomy. Both Bakula and Keating had to wear bladders on their throats as a special effect which were inflated when they growled. Following the experience, Park praised John Billingsley, who in his role as Doctor Phlox has to undertake similar make-up regimes for every episode.|$|E

Despite the damage, he pushed ahead with the assault and shot {{down one of the}} bombers. Flames from the burning engine then began to sweep back, and Crombie ordered Moss to bail out.

Due to his efforts, the penultimate aircraft was [...] "so badly damaged... that it could not have reached its base". At this time, Crombie sought out the fourth and final machine.

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> a day.

About this time the commodore fairly fell astern; and he discovered that the other boot was too large.

2500|$|Gaines's Mill was {{an intense}} battle, {{the largest of}} the Seven Days and the only {{clear-cut}} Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign. Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured). Since the Confederate assault was conducted against {{only a small portion of}} the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. Lee's victory, his first of the war, could have been more complete if it were not for the mishaps of Stonewall Jackson. Historian Stephen W. Sears speculates that it were not for Jackson's misdirected march and his poor staff work, the major assault that Lee unleashed at 7 p.m. could have occurred <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> earlier. This would have put Porter in grave jeopardy, without any last-minute reinforcements and the cover of darkness.
