25|$|The New Theatre {{movement}} {{started in}} America {{in the late}} 1920s. It was motivated by the depressed economic climate which resulted in widespread unemployment, more people on welfare and evictions of {{those who could not}} pay their rent. Most of the pieces performed where agit prop which attempted to capture social reality. When New Theatre groups were formed in Australia (beginning mainly as Worker's arts groups) they continued using agit prop in their plays. They were also committed to developing the highest possible theatrical standards as well as to introduce it to the Australian people by infusing theatre into cultural groups in all industries, organisations and districts. Active participants in the groups were a mix of communists, members of the Labor Party and political unaligned who wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>actively</b> <b>involved</b> in the group.|$|E

To the younger members of the court the prince appeared increasingly distant—almost from a different era. Count Grammont described Rupert as [...] "brave and courageous even to rashness, but cross-grained and incorrigibly obstinate... he was polite, even to excess, unseasonably; but haughty, and even brutal, when he ought to have been gentle and courteous... his manners were ungracious: he had a dry hard-favoured visage, and a stern look, even when he wished to please; but, when he was out of humour, he was the true picture of reproof". Rupert's health during this period was also less robust; his head wound from his employment in France required a painful trepanning treatment, his leg wound continued to hurt and he still suffered from the malaria he had caught while in the Gambia.|$|E

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film a four star rating, and praised Kaufman's writing, stating [...] "Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on Being John Malkovich, in 1999." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek felt Meryl Streep had not [...] "been this much fun to watch in years", while Mike Clark of USA Today gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: [...] "Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot." ...|$|E

For Herschel Hardin, because of the remarkable hold of the siege mentality and the concern with survival, Canada in its essentials is [...] "a public enterprise country." [...] According to Hardin, the [...] "fundamental mode of Canadian life" [...] has always been, [...] "the un-American mechanism of redistribution as opposed to the mystic American mechanism of market rule."

2500|$|West End {{residents}} have been very active in shaping their neighbourhood and maintaining its liveability. In the 1970s, residents banded together to calm traffic that was using the neighbourhood as a shortcut between downtown Vancouver and the suburbs of the North Shore, across the Lions' Gate Bridge. They also staged a successful [...] "Shame the Johns" [...] campaign to rid the West End of the prostitution that was then prevalent in the neighbourhood. This campaign was aided by a 1984 injunction granted by then-B.C. Supreme Court Justice Allan McEachern which banned prostitutes from working west of Granville Street. This forced prostitutes away from the relative safety of Davie Street into Yaletown, then a warehouse district, and eventually into the Downtown Eastside, where already vulnerable prostitutes were even more open to violence and abuse.

Eno recalled in June 1993 that he wanted Dravs [...] "to look at the improvisations and see what he could make of them" [...] while he [...] and James carried on recording Laid. Each improvisation started with the band recording a jam session improvisation, and then Eno or Dravs would then select a [...] "promising" [...] part of the improvised music and mix it, but with only one take on each mix to keep in the improvisation spirit. According to Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club, each piece would be [...] "whisked away" [...] to Dravs [...] "straightaway" [...] for studio [...] "tinkering" [...] after the initial jamming process. Bassist Jim Glennie recalled that [...] "it {{was a bit of a}} production line: We’d jam, those would go over to Markus to start properly messing about with. I think Brian was happy for us <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>actively</b> <b>involved</b> in that process, to try and keep it away from the main studio."
