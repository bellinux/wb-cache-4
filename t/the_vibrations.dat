40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> {{performance of}} medium-speed mill-foundation coupled system, eight mills in five thermal power plants {{were tested in}} site. <b>The</b> <b>vibration</b> displacement and acceleration of upper and lower bedplates of foundations and equipment bodies were measured. According to the test results, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> safety of mills is evaluated. The study shows that <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> displacement of medium-speed mill with spring vibration-isolated foundation meets the code requirements, but <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> displacement of equipment body is larger. <b>The</b> <b>vibration</b> displacement of equipment body should be controlled by limiting <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> displacement of foundation platform in design...|$|R

5|$|Soon {{after the}} railway opened, {{complaints}} about vibrations from passing trains {{began to be}} made by occupiers of buildings along the route. <b>The</b> <b>vibrations</b> were caused by the heavy, largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44tons (44.7tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31tons (31.5tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> felt at the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee's report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR's choice of 100lb/yard (49.60kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to the vibration.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a {{voracious}} predator. Within a {{few minutes}} of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs {{on the sides of the}} two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
30|$|In Figure  8 (a), <b>the</b> maximum <b>vibration</b> {{amplitude}} 0.48  mm {{occurs in}} the velocity 2  m/s, which is the 5.3 times than the value in the velocity 0.2  m/s. <b>The</b> <b>vibration</b> balance position is over the horizontal plane when the value of velocity exceeds 2  m/s. Then, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude decreases with the increases in the velocity when the velocity exceeds 2  m/s. <b>The</b> minimum <b>vibration</b> amplitude 0.4  mm is obtained in the velocity 3  m/s, which is the 4.4 times than the value in the velocity 0.2  m/s. It is derived that the fluctuation 20 % occurs for <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude in <b>the</b> velocity range of 1 ‒ 3  m/s. For <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> frequency, <b>the</b> maximum <b>vibration</b> frequency 23.69  Hz {{occurs in the}} velocity 2.5  m/s and <b>the</b> minimum <b>vibration</b> frequency 23.33  Hz occurs in the velocity 1  m/s. Comprehensive analysis are conducted that the fluctuation 2 % occurs for <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> frequency in <b>the</b> velocity range of 1 ‒ 3  m/s. It means that <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> frequency exhibits independence on the inlet velocity. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude is more susceptible to the fluid velocity compared to <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> frequency.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>vibration</b> {{characteristics}} of inertial vibration feeders were analyzed. Combining active with passive <b>vibration</b> isolation, <b>the</b> hybrid <b>vibration</b> isolation of inertial vibration feeders was researched. Adopting <b>the</b> passive <b>vibration</b> isolation, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> transmissibility {{can be reduced}} effectively, but the work efficiency of <b>the</b> inertial <b>vibration</b> feeder is reduced too. By choosing right feedback variables and appropriate feedback gain, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> transmissibility and <b>the</b> work efficiency of <b>the</b> inertial <b>vibration</b> feeder can be improved markedly by <b>the</b> hybrid <b>vibration</b> isolation. When <b>the</b> velocity feedback gain {{is equal to the}} upper damping coefficient and the displacement feedback gain is equal to the upper spring stiffness, <b>the</b> inertial <b>vibration</b> feeder has <b>the</b> best work efficiency and <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> transmissibility approximates zero.

5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{vibration}} magnitude model [Wan 06] {{established for}} the PHANToM haptic device, we have investigated the usability of different modes within a line tracking task. Three key questions were evaluated: (1) does vibration aid in tracking visible lines? (2) Which of <b>the</b> key <b>vibration</b> modes is preferred, either <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> online mode where <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> decreases with <b>the</b> distance from the line, or <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> offline mode where <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> increases away from the line? (3) And is linear or model constrained mapping more beneficial to the task? The experiment results show that although <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> mode implemented on visible lines is actually more time-consuming than <b>the</b> mode without <b>vibration,</b> <b>the</b> time ratios spent in high accuracy areas with vibration are enhanced. In comparison with <b>the</b> online <b>vibration,</b> <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> offline mode provides the more accurate performance to both visible and invisible lines. In certain cases, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> magnitude model mapping mode is shown to give superior results, however generally it has the similar usability with the linear mapping mode...|$|R
30|$|Both <b>the</b> {{self-excited}} <b>vibration</b> of <b>the</b> wheel–rail {{system in}} the present paper and <b>the</b> traditional stick–slip <b>vibration</b> of <b>the</b> wheel–rail system fall {{into the category of}} <b>the</b> friction-induced <b>vibration,</b> but there is also some difference between them.

5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E
25|$|Damped vibration: When {{the energy}} of a {{vibrating}} system is gradually dissipated by friction and other resistances, <b>the</b> <b>vibrations</b> {{are said to be}} damped. <b>The</b> <b>vibrations</b> gradually reduce or change in frequency or intensity or cease and the system rests in its equilibrium position.Example of this type of vibration is the vehicular suspension dampened by the shock absorber.|$|E

40|$|A new {{research}} method based on <b>vibration</b> testing for <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue of FRP was proposed in this paper. Through the testing on a closed-loop controlled vibration fatigue test system, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue phenomenon of typical carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) cantilevered laminate specimens was carefully studied. Moreover, a method {{based on the}} frequency response function was proposed to monitor the fatigue damage accumulation of specimens. On the basis of that, the influence factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue life of CFRP were experimentally studied. The influence of amplitude probability distribution of <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> load spectrum on the fatigue life was deeply explored. Compared with Gaussian random <b>vibration,</b> <b>the</b> non-Gaussian random load has {{a significant impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue life of CFRP. The experimental results also showed that the magnitude of power spectral density (PSD) has a significant effect on <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue life of specimens. For Gaussian <b>vibration</b> load, <b>the</b> frequency bandwidth almost has no effects on <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue life of CFRP. However, for non-Gaussian vibration load, it has a great impact on the fatigue life. When PSD magnitude and frequency bandwidth are constant, the root mean square (RMS) is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> fatigue life of composites...|$|R
