40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis "Transformations of <b>tramping</b> movement after 1989 " investigates changes, {{which the}} <b>tramping</b> movement underwent {{after the fall}} of the Communist regime. <b>Tramps</b> were persecuted before 1989 and could freely express themselves only in very limited ways. The work attempts to answer the question, of how <b>tramps</b> have coped with the new freedom and how it changed the movement itself. The research was carried out by qualitative means, because current <b>tramping</b> is almost totally neglected in expert literature. The method of autobiographical narrative interview was followed throughout the data collection process. It allows one to analyze the changes mentioned by the informants in the context of their life story. The empirical part of the thesis presents the changes of <b>tramping,</b> their origins, and their evaluations from the narrators' perspectives. The part also investigates the impact of <b>tramping</b> itself on their lives and the changes of their perception of the movement throughout life. Despite <b>tramping</b> not being officially banned nowadays, <b>tramping</b> suffers significant hardship from state and national park rangers. It must also cope with a substantial loss in number of members, which the post-revolution generation of <b>tramps</b> cannot replenish.

5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little <b>Tramp</b> from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the <b>Tramp</b> would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the <b>Tramp</b> when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
