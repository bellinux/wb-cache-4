5|$|Because {{the land}} routes between <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> and Jin were {{controlled}} by the Liao, diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the Bohai Sea. Negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> wanted to acquire horses from the Khitans. Song diplomats traveled to the Jin court to meet Aguda in 1118, while Jurchen envoys arrived in <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> capital Kaifeng the next year. At the beginning the two sides agreed to keep whatever Liao territory they would seize in combat. In 1120, Aguda agreed to cede the Sixteen Prefectures to <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual tributary payments that <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> had been giving the Liao. By the end of 1120, however, the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital, and offered <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> only parts of the Sixteen Prefectures.

5|$|By 1127, Jin had conquered most of {{northern}} China and besieged <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong of <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> was captured. The Jurchens took him and <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> royal family to Manchuria as hostages. Members of <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, first in <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> southern capital (modern Shangqiu), {{and then in}} Hangzhou in 1129. The move of <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> capital south to Hangzhou signals {{the transition from the}} Northern Song era to the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127; he is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozong. The Jurchen general Wuzhu crossed the Yangtze River in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across the Yangtze, where he fought off a stronger Song fleet commanded by Han Shizhong.|$|E
