5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial {{should be on the}} road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E

25|$|Beauty {{contests}} {{have been}} criticised for reinforcing {{the idea that}} girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance. This is an especially sensitive issue for naturists as being contrary to the naturist philosophy of body-acceptance of all body types, and that women are not there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at.</b> Beauty contests are no longer as common {{as they were in}} the 1950s and 1960s in mainstream naturist venues.|$|E
25|$|The American {{psychologist}} James H. Leuba (1868–1946), in A Psychological Study of Religion, {{accounts for}} mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he {{considered to be}} necessary if religious psychology were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> scientifically. Shamans {{all over the world}} and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of drugs leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.|$|E
25|$|The {{inherent}} tendency test theoretically {{has a lower}} threshold {{than the}} real risk test, thereby causing persons who are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test {{as it had been}} set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt– that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court– while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates that the words in the impugned publication or speech are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.|$|E

[...] He stressed that the ban made the sport more dangerous. Several drivers, such as Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, joined him in his criticism. It transpired after the race that Rosberg had had the same problem, a couple of laps after it occurred on Hamilton's car, but was able to solve it faster than his teammate.|$|E

500|$|The Act is {{relatively}} short, divided into 5 sections, the fifth covering {{the extent of}} the Act and its commencement date. Section 1 covers the test to determine if something is obscene; an article is taken to be obscene if the entire article [...] "is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it". The test is based on [...] "persons"; DPP v Whyte [...] AC 849 established that it was not sufficient for an individual to be depraved or corrupted, it must be that a significant number of people likely to read it would become corrupt. [...] "article" [...] is defined within Section 1 as anything containing material that is read or looked at, any sound recordings and any film or other picture record. A publisher, as used in the Act, is also defined in Section 1; [...] "publisher" [...] is taken to mean anyone who [...] "distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire", or [...] "in the case of an article containing or embodying matter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> or a record, shows, plays or projects it". The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 amended this section to include the transmission of the article electronically.|$|E

2500|$|He {{moved to}} the hilltop of Vence in 1943, where he {{produced}} his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled Jazz. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for Jazz. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting [...] "An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success…" ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas built {{variants}} on the Linden Court design {{aimed at}} upper-middle income customers with the Château and Towers projects.

The elegant Château cooperative apartment complex was built in French Renaissance style. The twelve buildings surround a large common garden. [...] They have slate mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows, and diaperwork brick walls. The early gardens were designed only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at.</b> As {{the concept of the}} garden apartment evolved, and the garden areas became relatively larger compared to the built areas, the design of the shared gardens began to include paved spaces where people could meet or sit.
