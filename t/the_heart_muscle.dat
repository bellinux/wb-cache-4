5|$|Heart: {{cardiomyopathy}} (weakness of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle)</b> {{is a rare}} but recognized {{problem in}} Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is {{established}} by the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> to contract.|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Intracardiac {{injections}} are injections {{that are}} given directly into <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> or ventricles. They {{are used in}} emergencies.|$|R
50|$|A {{pacemaker}} (or artificial pacemaker, {{so as not}} to {{be confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>heart's</b> natural pacemaker) is a medical device which uses electrical impulses, delivered by electrodes contracting <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> to regulate <b>the</b> beating of <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) {{measures}} the electrical depolarization of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> using various electrodes placed near {{the chest and}} limbs. This measure of depolarization {{can be used to}} monitor heart rhythm.|$|R
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle).</b> This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} cone-shaped, with its base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The heart is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle,</b> similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E
50|$|Because IpTxi {{also works}} on the RyR {{channels}} of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> it could potentially {{be used as a}} drug against arrhythmia. This has not yet been proven, and must be studied in vivo first.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, US {{researchers}} {{reported that they}} injected a genetically modified virus into <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of guinea pigs. This virus inserted into <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> a gene called Tbx18 which enabled heartbeats. The researchers forecast that one day this technique {{could be used to}} restore the heartbeat in humans who would otherwise need electronic pacemakers.|$|R
25|$|Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) is {{the process}} of {{recording}} the electrical activity of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> {{over a period of time}} using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise from <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle's</b> electrophysiologic pattern of depolarizing and repolarizing during each heartbeat. It is a very commonly performed cardiology test.|$|R
5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle,</b> causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{warnings}} must {{be examined}} before melarsoprol treatment can be initiated. Prior to initiation, the following must be noted: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, kidney or liver disease, cardiac problems (high blood pressure, irregular beating of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> or arrhythmias, any damage to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles</b> and potential signs of heart failure), preexisting nervous system disorders, and {{any signs of}} leprosy.|$|R
50|$|Complications in {{the form}} of endocarditis, liver {{inflammation}}, inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>heart's</b> <b>muscle,</b> joint inflammation, keratoconjunctivitis (occasionally extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the lacrimal gland/orbit), and neurologic complications (brain inflammation) may occasionally occur. Severe pneumonia requiring intensive-care support may also occur. Fatal cases have been reported (less than 1% of cases).|$|R
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle's</b> relaxation or contraction.|$|R
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
50|$|ARVD {{is caused}} by genetic defects of <b>the</b> parts of <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> (also called {{myocardium}} or cardiac muscle) known as desmosomes, areas on <b>the</b> surface of <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> cells which link the cells together. The desmosomes are composed of several proteins, {{and many of those}} proteins can have harmful mutations.|$|R
50|$|Beta receptors {{are found}} on cells of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscles,</b> smooth muscles, airways, arteries, kidneys, and other tissues {{that are part}} of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system and lead to stress responses, especially when they are stimulated by epinephrine (adrenaline). Beta blockers interfere with the binding to the receptor of epinephrine and other stress hormones, and weaken the effects of stress hormones.|$|R
50|$|The T-box 1 protein {{appears to}} be {{necessary}} for the normal development of large arteries that carry blood out of <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>muscles</b> and bones of the face and neck, and glands such as the thymus and parathyroid. Although the T-box 1 protein acts as a transcription factor, {{it is not yet}} known which genes are regulated by the protein.|$|R
25|$|Angina, {{also known}} as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually due to not enough blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{coronary}} circulation system provides a blood supply to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> itself. The {{coronary circulation}} begins near {{the origin of}} the aorta by two coronary arteries: the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery. After nourishing <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle,</b> blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium. Back flow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.|$|E
25|$|Carditis: Inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> (myocarditis) {{which can}} {{manifest}} as {{congestive heart failure}} with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur.|$|E
50|$|Relaxin receptors {{have been}} found in <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> smooth <b>muscle,</b> <b>the</b> {{connective}} tissue, and central and autonomous nervous system.|$|R
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle's</b> ability to contract, {{which can lead}} to <b>heart</b> failure. <b>The</b> causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> Cardiomyopathy can cause <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|R
50|$|Nitroglycerin {{can be used}} {{immediately}} to widen the coronary arteries and help increase blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> In addition, nitroglycerin causes peripheral venous and artery dilation reducing cardiac preload and afterload. These reductions allow for decreased stress on <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and therefore lower the oxygen demand of <b>the</b> <b>heart's</b> <b>muscle</b> cells. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel can help reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation, as well as combining these with an anticoagulant such as a low molecular weight heparin.|$|R
25|$|In acute-onset AF {{associated}} with chest pain, cardiac troponins or other markers {{of damage to}} <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> may be ordered. Coagulation studies (INR/aPTT) are usually performed, as anticoagulant medication may be commenced.|$|E
25|$|This form is {{less common}} and affects puppies {{infected}} in the uterus or shortly after birth until about 8 weeks of age. The virus attacks <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> and the puppy often dies suddenly or {{after a brief}} period of breathing difficulty due to pulmonary edema. On the microscopic level, there are many points of necrosis of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> that are associated with mononuclear cellular infiltration. The formation of excess fibrous tissue (fibrosis) is often evident in surviving dogs. Myofibers are the site of viral replication within cells. The disease {{may or may not be}} accompanied with the signs and symptoms of the intestinal form. However, this form is now rarely seen due to widespread vaccination of breeding dogs.|$|E
25|$|At least 10% of treated {{cases of}} STEMI do not develop {{necrosis}} of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>muscle.</b> A successful restoration of blood flow {{is known as}} aborting the heart attack. About 25% of STEMIs can be aborted if treated within the hour of symptoms onset.|$|E
5000|$|During {{physical}} exertion or moderate intensity exercise lactate {{released from}} working muscle and other tissue beds {{is the primary}} fuel source for <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> exiting <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> through monocarboxylate transport protein (MCT). [...] This evidence is supported by an increased amount of MCT shuttle proteins in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and <b>muscle</b> {{in direct proportion to}} exertion as measured through muscular contraction.|$|R
40|$|Serum samples {{obtained}} from 15 astronauts {{before and after}} spaceflights were studied {{with the use of}} the indirect immunofluorescent method. In seven astronauts antibodies to different elements of <b>the</b> human <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> appeared after flights. Strong and very strong luminescence of <b>the</b> elements of <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue was detected in the astronauts after the third space flight. In a study of the sera on sections of bovine <b>heart</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>the</b> reactions of the sera taken before and after flight were found to show no essential differences...|$|R
5000|$|High {{expression}} {{has been}} found in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and skeletal <b>muscle,</b> as indicated through human expression profiling. Microarray expression of normal human tissues [...] also predict expression in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and skeletal <b>muscle,</b> a 95-97 percentile rank (amongst other tissues tested for normal human expression of TMEM143).|$|R
