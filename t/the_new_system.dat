The inspiration for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers.

5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>system,</b> known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This eliminates the need to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.|$|E

Amid nostalgia for the ancient Roman Republic, the theories of the Enlightenment were at their peak, and the devisers of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> looked to nature for their inspiration.

40|$|In 1996, both Japan and New Zealand adopted <b>new</b> electoral <b>systems</b> {{with strong}} similarities, though also {{significant}} differences.

The {{aims of the}} reform were less clear, and more party-driven, in Japan than in New Zealand. In japan {{there is no evidence}} as yet that 'money politics', or the importance of the individual candidate, have disappeared. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> have had an effect on the internal life of the parties, especi-ally on candidate selection. The change in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>system,</b> as could have been predicted, has led to a great increase in proportional-ity, but <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Japanese <b>system</b> is actually less proportional than the previous single non-transferable vote electoral system. The effect on <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand political <b>system</b> will be major, but the extent of the impact of electoral system change in japan is not yet clear. KEY WORDS _ candidate selection _ electoral reform _ electoral systems _ japan _ <b>New</b> Zealand <b>The</b> impact of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> electoral <b>systems</b> in Japan and New Zealand can be examined from a number of perspectives. Change in Japan came at a time of upheaval in the party system and it was hoped that it might lead to certain changes in political style. New Zealand also held its first election under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> rules in October 1996, after several decades with its previous system, and since there are certain similarities between <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> in Japan and New Zealand- though there is also a significant difference- we shall draw a number of comparisons between the two. ...|$|R
