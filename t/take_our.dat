25|$|I've {{studied the}} ideas of Confucius, Buddha, and Jesus; I respect them as saints, but even if there's a heaven made by them, it's not a nation created by our nation, and I will never <b>take</b> <b>our</b> nation there.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Pythia Peay first {{argued for}} the {{existence}} of a fourth wave of feminism, combining justice with religious spirituality. According to Jennifer Baumgardner in 2011, a fourth wave, incorporating online resources such as social media, may have begun in 2008, inspired partly by <b>Take</b> <b>Our</b> Daughters to Work Days. This fourth wave in turn has inspired or been associated with: the Doula Project for children's services; post-abortion talk lines; pursuit of reproductive justice; plus-size fashion support; transgenderism support; male feminism; sex work acceptance; and developing media including Feministing, Racialicious, blogs, and Twitter campaigns.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{announced}} his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999, in Nashua, New Hampshire, {{saying he was}} staging [...] "a fight to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> government back from the power brokers and special interests, {{and return it to}} the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve". The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment.|$|E
500|$|Following the Master of Reality {{world tour}} in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: [...] "The band started to become very {{fatigued}} and very tired. We'd {{been on the}} road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> time with the next album." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{practice}} of military deception predates Russia. The Art of War, written in 5th century BC and {{attributed to the}} ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tsu, describes a strategy of deception: [...] "I will force the enemy to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness". Early in Russia's history, in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, Prince Dmitry Donskoy defeated the armies of the Mongol Golden Horde using a surprise attack from a regiment hidden in forest. The tactics of that battle are still cited in Russian cadet schools.|$|E

500|$|McCain finally {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy on September 27, 1999 before {{a thousand people}} in Greeley Park in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying [...] "It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me that I am {{a candidate for president}} to the United States." [...] He further said he was staging [...] "a fight to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve." [...] As originally planned, he began his announcement day with a visit to the Naval Academy.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} week of January 2012, Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani left for an {{official}} five-day visit to China, a close ally of Pakistan, at the invitation of the Chinese leadership. According to military sources, the army chief was expected to meet the Chinese president and prime minister alongside top security officials, and a focal agenda of the meeting included discussions on the NATO incident, a briefing by Kayani on rewriting terms of engagement with the US, as well as security co-operation between China and Pakistan. Commenting on the occasion, a security official said: [...] "We want to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> relationship with China to the next level".|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, the Turkish {{force that}} would confront the New Zealanders was {{provided}} by the 19th Division, comprising the 57th, 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments, all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal. Kemal was noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the Gallipoli Campaign. How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and <b>take</b> <b>our</b> place." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ottoman {{defenders}} {{were too}} few {{to defeat the}} landing but inflicted many casualties and contained the attack close to the shore. By the morning of 25 April, out of ammunition and with nothing but bayonets to meet the attackers on the slopes leading up from the beach to the heights of Chunuk Bair, the 57th Infantry Regiment received orders from Kemal [...] "I do not order you to fight, I order you to die. In the time which passes until we die, other troops and commanders can come forward and <b>take</b> <b>our</b> places." [...] and every man of the regiment was either killed or wounded.|$|E
500|$|In Kiev, Inna Shevchenko, a topless feminist activist {{from the}} group FEMEN, used a {{chainsaw}} to destroy a four-meter wooden sculpture of Christ on the cross, on a hill overlooking the city center. The cross had been erected during the Orange Revolution of 2004–2005, to commemorate victims of Stalin's repression. The desecration of the cross was repudiated by Maria Alyokhina of Pussy Riot, who said [...] "Their surprise displays and protests against authoritarianism are similar to us, but we look at feminism differently, especially the form of speech. We wouldn't <b>take</b> <b>our</b> clothes off, and will not. Their latest action, the sawing of the cross, does not create a feeling of solidarity, unfortunately." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should <b>take</b> <b>our</b> time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cast members}} of the show took the news about the show ending well. Hayes said: [...] "I'm proud of {{being a part of}} {{something}} in history and I'm proud to have been given a platform to make people laugh." [...] McCormack added, [...] "We have never taken ourselves or this show too seriously but now that it's over I <b>take</b> <b>our</b> collective achievement very, very seriously." [...] The actors were satisfied with the episode and thought the viewers would find it satisfying as well. [...] "It's daring and ambitious and more far-reaching than most finales go. I think people will be quite surprised," [...] McCormack said. Messing added: [...] "I think Will & Grace fans will be satisfied. Ultimately, [...] was done beautifully and it ties up loose ends for all of the characters in a way that's wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{the dates}} for the show were announced, there was high demand for tickets. As sponsor of the North American Monster Ball Tour, Virgin Mobile {{customers}} had access to presale tickets. Bob Stohrer, VP of Marketing for Virgin Mobile USA said [...] "We are excited to <b>take</b> <b>our</b> partnership with Lady Gaga and The Monster Ball Tour to another level. [...] We'll also build on our partnership around combating youth homelessness and continue to enhance the tour experience for fans and our customers." [...] Shows in {{the first leg of}} the tour were sold-out completely, prompting Live Nation Inc. to announce that Gaga will return to the U.S. in February 2011 for another run of U.S. dates. The 2011 dates for the North American Monster Ball Tour were announced as starting from February 19 in Atlantic City, with ten arena dates confirmed through April 18. Additional shows were announced, and Semi Precious Weapons collaborated with Gaga until the tour ended. Live Nation Entertainment's global touring division, headed by chairman Arthur Fogel, held the reins as promoter/producer of the Monster Ball tour.|$|E
500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens {{who have come to}} <b>take</b> <b>our</b> jobs... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E
