To get CBC to adopt the series, Peyton showed the company a commercial with the CBC logo in blood, remarking that [...] "It's been way too long that you've waited to have your logo covered in blood." [...] He had also said that What It's Like Being Alone was meant to attract university {{and high school students}} as an audience, and he felt that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not ordinarily watch the CBC. [...] CBC itself was looking for original material, and was enthusiastic about the series because it seemed to stand out among Canadian television productions. [...] Peyton's co-producer was Fred Fuchs, who later rose in the CBC staff; one critic believed Fuchs' promotion to be a reason why CBC adopted the series.|$|E

He claims his generation had become intellectually aloof from religion, rebellious and disillusioned and in Chapter 2 explores further {{reasons for this}} disillusion, including the Suez Crisis and the Profumo Affair. In Chapter 3, Hitchens recounts how he embraced scientific inquiry and adopted liberal positions {{on issues such as}} marriage, abortion, homosexuality, and patriotism. Chapter 4 is a lament for the [...] "noble austerity" [...] of his childhood in Britain. Chapter 5 explores what Hitchens views as the pseudo-religion surrounding Churchill and World War II heroes – a [...] "great cult of noble, patriotic death" [...] whose only equivalent, he claims, was in the Soviet Union. Hitchens then asserts that, [...] "The Christian Church has been powerfully damaged by letting itself be confused with love of country and the making of great wars". In Chapter 6 Hitchens recalls being a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union and a trip to Mogadishu, and how these experiences convinced him that, [...] "his own civilisation was infinitely precious and utterly vulnerable". In Chapter 7 Hitchens charts his return to Christianity, and makes particular reference to the experience of seeing the Rogier van der Weyden painting The Last Judgement: [...] "I gaped, my mouth actually hanging open. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not appear remote or from the ancient past; they were my own generation ... I had absolutely no doubt I was among the damned". In Chapter 8 Hitchens examines the diminishing of Christianity in Britain and its potential causes.|$|E

2500|$|As of the 17th century, Tennessee was {{the middle}} ground for several {{different}} native peoples. Along the Mississippi River was the Chickasaw & Choctaw peoples, and inland of them were the Coushatta-- all three {{were part of the}} Muskogean language family. Before European contact, they were supposedly all a loose collection of Mississippian culture city-states with their own leaders, but upon contact with Europeans, they merged into larger nations, spread out and adopted a European lifestyle, earning many of them the title of the [...] "Civilized Tribes." [...] During the height of the Mississippians, hundreds of walled cities extended throughout the American south from Louisiana to the east coast, up the Mississippi into Wisconsin & a few fringe cities along larger rivers on the Great Plains. They had complex society & agriculture. They did not build with stone, but made plenty of examples of sculpture work in clay, stone & copper. Most of what remains of these cities, however, are large, pyramidal, earthen hills (upon which chiefs & upper-classmen would build their homes) and artful burial mounds. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not develop the Mississippian culture, however, but adopted it from the Caddo people west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} the Joint history project finds these Japanese views questionable: There is no {{evidence}} of Japan ever having been sophisticated enough to control any part of Korea during the time of Jingū. However, there is archaeological evidence of Koreans going to Japan during this time, According to the book [...] "Korea and Japan in East Asian History", and [...] "Paekche of Korea and the Origin of Yamato Japan" [...] such findings as horse sculptures, Shinju-kyo, painting and iron-ware made in Northern Wei China which do not match the dates of Emperor Ojin's reign.

Also significant is Emperor Ōjin's reign is off by more than a century with Geunchogo of Baekje in other words <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not exist in the same time period.

In those times, the principal saloons were always populous with river men; given fifty players present, thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from the river.

There, I admit that a bicycle is impossible. We can dismiss the idea. We turn to the country on the north. Here there lies a grove of trees, marked as the 'Ragged Shaw,' and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor, Lower Gill Moor, extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upward. Here, at one side of this wilderness, is Holdernesse Hall, ten miles by road, but only six across the moor. It is a peculiarly desolate plain. A few moor farmers have small holdings, where they rear sheep and cattle. Except these, the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the Chesterfield high road.

60|$|The country {{cousin was}} {{impressed}} at last. With staring eyes and opened mouth, {{he watched the}} man who had been sitting only a few tables away from them push back the plate on which lay his bill and rise to his feet. One of the chief maîtres d'hôtel handed him his straw hat and cane, two waiters stood behind his chair, the manager hurried forward to see that the way was clear for him. Yet there was nothing about the appearance of the man himself which seemed to suggest his demanding any of these things. He was of little over medium height, broad-shouldered, but with a body somewhat loosely built. He wore quiet grey clothes with a black tie, a pearl pin, and a neat coloured shirt. His complexion was a little pale, his features well-defined, his eyes dark and penetrating but hidden underneath rather bushy eyebrows. His deportment was quite unassuming, and he left the place as though entirely ignorant of the impression he created. The little cluster of chorus girls looked at him almost with awe. Only one of them ventured to laugh into his face as though anxious to attract his notice. Another dropped her veil significantly as he drew near. The millionaire seemed to become a smaller man as he glanced over his shoulder. The lady who had been recently divorced bent over her plate. A group of noisy young fellows talking together about a Stock Exchange deal, suddenly ceased their clamour of voices as he passed. A man sitting alone, with a drawn face, deliberately concealed himself behind a newspaper, and an aldermanic-looking gentleman who was entertaining a fluffy-haired young lady from a well-known typewriting office, looked for a moment like an errant school-boy. Not one of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> Sanford Quest seem to see. He passed out to the elevator, tipped the man who sycophantly took him the whole of the way down without a stop, walked through the crowded hall of the hotel and entered a closed motor-car without having exchanged greetings with a soul. Yet there was scarcely a person there who could feel absolutely sure that he had not been noticed.|$|E
60|$|There are, I say, a sort {{of people}} that tremble at the words of God, and that are afraid of doing ought that is {{contrary}} to them; but they are only such with whose souls and spirits the Word has had to do. For the rest, they are resolved to go on their course, let God say what he will. 'As for the word' of the Lord, said rebellious Israel to Jeremiah, 'that thou hast spoken unto us {{in the name of}} the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth' (Jer 44:16). But do you think that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> ever feel the power and majesty of the Word of God to break their hearts? No, verily; had that been so, they would have trembled at the words of God; they would have been afraid of the words of God. God may command some people what he will, they will do what they list. What care they for God? what care they for his Word? Neither threats nor promises, neither punishments or favours will make them obedient to the Word of God; and all because they have not felt the power of it, their hearts have not been broken with it. When king Josias did but read in God's Book what punishment God had threatened against rebellious Israel, though he himself was a holy and good man, he humbled himself, 'he rent his clothes,' and wept before the Lord, and was afraid of the judgment threatened (2 Kings 22; 2 Chron 34). For he knew what a dreadful thing the Word of God is. Some men, as I said before, dare do anything, let the Word of God be never so much against it; but they that tremble at the Word dare not do so. No, they must make the Word their rule for all they do; they must go to the Holy Bible, and there inquire what may or may not be done; for they tremble at the Word. This then is another sign, a true sign, that the heart has been broken, namely, 'When the heart is made afraid of, and trembleth at the Word' (Acts 9:4-6, 16:29,30). Trembling at the Word is caused by a belief of what is deserved, threatened, and of what will come, if not prevented by repentance; and therefore the heart melts, and breaks before the Lord.|$|E
