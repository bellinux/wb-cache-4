Sample was initially constituted by 60 patients, randomly divided into three groups: I- stabilization splints, II- repositioning splints and III- no treatment. The whole sample was evaluated by means of TMJ and muscle palpation, mandibular AROM, analysis of occlusal contacts, joint sounds inspection and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for one year; 52 patients composed the final sample. A significant (after 15 days) improvement in pain report (VAS) and palpation index was found for group II (p< 0. 01). The occurrence of occlusal alterations as posterior open bite or gross interferences after the splint therapy and increased muscle tenderness were not problems in this study. Similar results in joint noises reduction were observed for the entire sample. It was concluded that controlled <b>partial</b> <b>use</b> of repositioning splints is a beneficial tool in the management of intra-articular pain and dysfunction, with no risks of irreversible occlusal changes...|$|R
