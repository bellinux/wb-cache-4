5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> is now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> will be automatically separable.|$|E

5|$|A recent design, called Hy-Con, {{seeks to}} combine the {{strengths}} of single-hull and double-hull construction. Short for Hybrid Configuration, this design doubles the forward-most and rear-most holds and leaves the others single-hulled. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> increases the ship's solidity at key points, while reducing the overall tare weight.|$|E
5|$|Another method uses provenance: for instance, all {{denominations}} {{that ultimately}} trace their history {{back to the}} LDS Church in Utah are organized as one factional group. Divergent Paths of the Restoration—a reference work on this subject—follows <b>this</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} {{this is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates.

5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. <b>This</b> <b>approach,</b> almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E

5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock.
