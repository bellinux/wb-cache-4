2500|$|The British {{psychologist}} Charles Spearman in 1904 {{made the}} first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests.

Spearman named it g for [...] "general factor" [...] and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks s.

The scoring process is generalized {{with the help of}} correctness coefficient â€“ the new concept set up by the author. The paper describes complexly formalization of the scoring process, contextualizes the contemporary used methods to the general context and brings new methods as well. The scoring methods of sorting items and guessing penalty are described in detail. Observations described in this paper can help examiners with more accurate assessment of achievement test results. In the first part, the theoretical basics of the <b>test</b> <b>item</b> scoring are given. We are going to find out that whole scoring process depends on the teaching objectives, <b>test</b> <b>item</b> types, curriculum taxonomy and achievement test objectives. Then the theory of the <b>test</b> <b>item</b> types is described. After this theoretical introduction the concepts of the total achievement test score and correctness coefficient are set up. Letâ€™s emphasize that using of the correctness coefficient is the new contribution of the author. Than the correctness coefficient is used to express the measure of examineeâ€™s answer accuracy within the different <b>test</b> <b>item</b> types. Using the correctness coefficient for evaluation of closed multiple-choice items, injective and general relational items, narrow open items, joining items and sorting items are deeply examined and described. Various scoring method for these item types are discussed, especially for the sorting and joining items. Afterwards the theory of penalty guessing is expressed {{with the help of the}} correctness co efficient, which strengthens the ability and universality of theory being described. The main goal of this research paper is to provide the complex theoretical overview of the <b>test</b> <b>item</b> scoring problems, which can be useful for pedagogues, examiners and testing application (or e-learning system) developers to provide more accurate and clear evaluation process of the achievement test...|$|R

2500|$|The Rasch {{model is}} often {{considered}} to be the 1PL IRT model. [...] However, proponents of Rasch modeling prefer to view it as a completely different approach to conceptualizing the relationship between data and theory. [...] Like other statistical modeling approaches, IRT emphasizes the primacy of the fit of a model to observed data, while the Rasch model emphasizes the primacy of the requirements for fundamental measurement, with adequate data-model fit being an important but secondary requirement to be met before a test or research instrument can be claimed to measure a trait. [...] Operationally, this means that the IRT approaches include additional model parameters to reflect the patterns observed in the data (e.g., allowing items to vary in their correlation with the latent trait), whereas in the Rasch approach, claims regarding the presence of a latent trait can only be considered valid when both (a) the data fit the Rasch model, and (b) <b>test</b> <b>items</b> and examinees conform to the model. Therefore, under Rasch models, misfitting responses require diagnosis of the reason for the misfit, and may be excluded from the data set if one can explain substantively why they do not address the latent trait. Thus, the Rasch approach can be seen to be a confirmatory approach, as opposed to exploratory approaches that attempt to model the observed data.
