5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E

A legend grew around the fateful IBM-DRI meeting (encouraged by Gates and various journalists), suggesting that Kildall had irresponsibly taken the day off for a recreational flight, and he became tired of constantly having to refute <b>that</b> <b>story.</b> <b>In</b> later years, he had occasional private expressions of bitterness at being overshadowed by Microsoft.|$|E
500|$|Scott Feinberg {{wrote in}} The Hollywood Reporter about a September 22 New York Times article that [...] "dredged up and {{highlighted}} a 1985 essay by another scholar, James Olney, that questioned the 'literal truth' of specific incidents in Northup's account {{and suggested that}} David Wilson, the white amanuensis to whom Northup had dictated his story, had taken the liberty of sprucing it up to make it even more effective at rallying public opinion against slavery." [...] According to Olney, when abolitionists invited an ex-slave to share his experience in slavery at an antislavery convention, and when they subsequently funded the appearance of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> print, [...] "they had certain clear expectations, well understood by themselves and well understood by the ex-slave, too." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz three days after another script idea fell through. [...] Spotnitz noted that [...] "Darin Morgan had left the show but was going to {{contribute}} an episode. And we realized at the eleventh hour that it wasn't going to happen, and we were stuck with nothing. John, Vince and I broke <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> maybe two days. We split up the acts, wrote it in probably another two days, and gave the crew something to prep before Christmas break. That was the worst ever." [...] Carter ended up rewriting the script over the holiday. The initial cut ended up being too long, resulting in a scene introducing Scully's older brother Bill Scully, played by Pat Skipper, being removed. The character, still played by Skipper, would eventually make his first appearance in the fourth-season finale [...] "Gethsemane". The scene which would have established the character was intended to echo a similar scene in the second season episode [...] "One Breath", which featured Don S. Davis as Scully's father. Both scenes featured the actors standing over a supine Scully, wearing white United States Navy dress uniforms. Also deleted from the episode was a kiss between Mulder and Scully, {{which would have been}} the first in the series' run. This was an ad-lib on Anderson and Duchovny's part, and was removed from the episode as it was something Chris Carter felt he wanted to make use of in the series' film adaptation. Such a kiss was eventually deferred to season six's [...] "Triangle".|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] it {{was stated}} the {{regenerative}} cycle creates {{a large amount}} of residual regeneration energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body. As demonstrated by the Tenth Doctor {{for the first time in}} <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> <b>in</b> the first fifteen hours of regeneration this energy is enough to even rapidly regrow a severed hand. This is in keeping with earlier serials, such as Robot, where the newly regenerated Fourth Doctor splits a brick with his bare hand, and in the 1996 television movie, where the Doctor is depicted battering down a heavy steel door in a hospital morgue.|$|E
2500|$|To fulfil the {{scheduling}} requirement, Freiberger came up {{with the}} [...] "double-up script" [...] solution. During [...] "double-up" [...] instalments, two first-unit production teams would film two episodes simultaneously. Landau and some of the supporting cast would be given expanded roles and would film an episode on location or on sets constructed for <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> Pinewood's Soundstage [...] "M", while Bain and the remaining supporting cast (also in expanded roles) would film their episode in the standing Alpha sets on Soundstage [...] "L". Landau and Bain would then be given minor roles in the opposing episodes. This cost- and time-saving measure was used to complete eight stories as four pairs: [...] "The Rules of Luton" [...] and [...] "The Mark of Archanon"; [...] "The AB Chrysalis" [...] and [...] ""; [...] "A Matter of Balance" [...] and [...] ""; [...] "Devil's Planet" [...] and [...] "Dorzak". A ninth episode, [...] "", was intentionally scripted with only one day's worth of work for Landau and Bain to allow their planned holiday to the French Riviera not to delay the series' production; the four supporting cast members (Schell, Anholt, Tate and Merton) were the recipients of much greater than usual exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Whether or not Lexa {{should be}} paired with Clarke was also debated, {{especially}} by {{fans of the}} Bellamy and Clarke relationship ("Bellarke"), which is canon in the books. This resulted in a rivalry between the fanbases. [...] In 2015, Sydney Bucksbaum of E! Online stated with regard to season 2, [...] "People {{who want to see}} Bellamy (Bob Morley) and Clarke (Eliza Taylor) get together—ahem, {{in every sense of the}} word—have had to suffer through a full season in which they were actually separated for pretty much the entire time." [...] Rothenberg told Bucksbaum that he was not dismissing the pairing; rather the Bellamy and Clarke romance was not yet the focus. He said the show gives indications that Bellamy and Clarke care deeply for each other, and those wanting a romance at the time should read the books. [...] "We played with the Lexa/Clarke storyline [...] and that [...] still ongoing because both characters [...] still breathing," [...] stated Rothenberg. [...] "The journey is long, and eventually we'll be able to tell <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> all its glory." [...] He said when it came to whether or not the series would end with Clarke and Lexa as a couple, he would not comment on the matter and knew where he wanted the series to go, but he was always open to better ideas. Eliza Taylor also weighed in on the matter, stating that she loves that bisexuality on the show is portrayed as normal, and that she also likes the chemistry between Bellamy and Clarke.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a very}} rusty old thing, {{not more}} than a foot in length, and half as much in height and breadth; but most ponderously iron-bound, with bars, and corners, and all sorts of fortification; looking very much like an ancient alms-box, such as are to be seen in the older rural churches of England, and which seem to {{intimate}} great distrust of those to whom the funds are committed. Indeed, there might be a shrewd suspicion that some ancient church beadle among Septimius's forefathers, when emigrating from England, had taken the opportunity of bringing the poor-box along with him. On looking close, too, there were rude embellishments on the lid and sides of the box in long-rusted steel, designs such as the Middle Ages were rich in; a representation of Adam and Eve, or of Satan and a soul, nobody could tell which; but, at any rate, an illustration of great value and interest. Septimius looked at this ugly, rusty, ponderous old box, so worn and battered with time, and recollected with a scornful smile the legends of which it was the object; all of which he despised and discredited, just as much as he did <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "Arabian Nights," [...] where a demon comes out of a copper vase, in a cloud of smoke that covers the sea-shore; for he was singularly invulnerable to all modes of superstition, all nonsense, except his own. But that one mode was ever in full force and operation with him. He felt strongly convinced that inside the old box was something that appertained to his destiny; the key that he had taken from the dead man's breast, had that come down through time, and across the sea, and had a man died to bring and deliver it to him, merely for nothing? It could not be.|$|E

[...] He paused fondly over those last words. [...] "Neat!" [...] he thought. [...] "Argument and hard hitting both in one. I wonder where my knack of writing comes from?"

6000|$|My {{doubts about}} the house you speak of are twofold, First, I could not leave town so soon as May, having affairs to arrange for a sick sister.

This has set me thinking, sometimes of the Yorkshire coast, sometimes of Dover. I {{would not have the}} house at Bonchurch reserved for me, therefore. But if it should be empty, we will go and look at it in a body. I reserve the more serious part of my letter until the last, my dear White, because it comes {{from the bottom of my}} heart. None of your friends have thought and spoken oftener of you and Mrs. White than we have these many weeks past. I should have written to you, but was timid of intruding on your sorrow. What you say, and the manner in which you tell me I am connected with it in your recollection of your dear child, now among the angels of God, gives me courage to approach your grief--to say what sympathy we have felt with it, and how we have not been unimaginative of these deep sources of consolation to which you have had recourse. The traveller who journeyed in fancy from this world to the next was struck to the heart to find the child he had lost, many years before, building him a tower in heaven.
