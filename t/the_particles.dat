5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} the propelled motions of a Janus particle in a periodically phase-separating binary fluid mixture. In this study, {{the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> tail prefers one of the binary fluid components and <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> head is neutral in the wettability.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of the nano-sized SiO 2 particles on substrates (nitride and silicon) is investigated {{and the surface}} density of deposited particles {{is found to be}} proportional to <b>the</b> volume <b>particle</b> concentration in <b>the</b> contamination solution. <b>The</b> <b>particle</b> surface density is estimated based on this proportionality.

5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed {{in a different}} way, scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may be}} the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> back to the palps.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>particles</b> are sorted by {{yet another}} group of cilia, which send the smaller particles, mainly minerals, to the prostyle so {{eventually}} they are excreted, while the larger ones, mainly food, are sent to the stomach's cecum (a pouch with no other exit) to be digested. The sorting process {{is by no means}} perfect.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. <b>The</b> <b>particles</b> are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the {{interstices}} between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> move. With this interpretation, <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics.

The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
25|$|As a charged {{particle}} travels, it disrupts the local electromagnetic field in its medium. In particular, the medium becomes electrically polarized by <b>the</b> <b>particle's</b> electric field. If <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> travels slowly then the disturbance elastically relaxes back to mechanical equilibrium as <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> passes. When <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> is traveling fast enough, however, the limited response {{speed of the}} medium means that a disturbance is left {{in the wake of}} <b>the</b> <b>particle,</b> and <b>the</b> energy contained in this disturbance radiates as a coherent shockwave.|$|R
50|$|For a {{particle}} at rest no drag force will be exhibited, which causes <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> to accelerate {{due to the}} applied force.

As <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> increases in velocity eventually the drag force and the applied force will approximately equate, causing no further change in <b>the</b> <b>particle's</b> velocity. This velocity is known as the terminal velocity, settling velocity or fall velocity of <b>the</b> <b>particle.</b> This is readily measurable by examining the rate of fall of individual particles.|$|R

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E

Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment.

The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground.

He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E
