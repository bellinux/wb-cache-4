5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 {{and many}} Western observers expected {{the same in}} Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election. With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. <b>The</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E

25|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> assumed power, the {{hierarchy}} began to oppose <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> government. The Archbishop was a vocal source of domestic opposition. The hierarchy was {{alleged to be}} motivated by fear {{of the emergence of}} the 'popular church' which challenged their centralized authority. The hierarchy also opposed social reforms implemented by <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> to aid the poor, allegedly because they saw it as a threat to their traditionally privileged position within society. In response to this perceived opposition, <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> shut down the church-run Radio Católica radio station on multiple occasions.|$|E
25|$|In the Nicaraguan general election, 1990, a {{coalition}} of anti-Sandinista parties (from {{the left and right}} of the political spectrum) led by Violeta Chamorro, the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, defeated <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas.</b> The defeat shocked <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> who had expected to win. Commentators such as Noam Chomsky and Brian Willson attributed the outcome to the U.S.-Contra threats to continue the war if <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> retained power, the general war-weariness of the Nicaraguan population, and the abysmal Nicaraguan economic situation.|$|E
25|$|A major {{turning point}} was the December 1972 Managua {{earthquake}} that killed over 10,000 people and left 500,000 homeless. A {{great deal of}} international relief {{was sent to the}} nation. Violent opposition to the government, especially to its widespread corruption, was then renewed with <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> being revived. <b>The</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> received some support from Cuba and the Soviet Union.|$|E

Many of these individuals were part of <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> National Liberation Front (FSLN). There was much hostility between <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government, which came into power in 1979, and the Jews.

50|$|During the Sandinista/Indian {{conflict}} in Nicaragua of the mid-1980s, Russell Means sided with Miskito Indians opposing <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government. <b>The</b> Miskito charged {{the government with}} forcing relocations {{of as many as}} 8,500 Miskito. This position lost AIM some support from certain leftwing and Central American solidarity organizations in the U.S. who opposed Contra activities and supported <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> movement. <b>The</b> complex situation included Contra insurgents' recruiting among Nicaraguan Indian groups, including some Miskitos. Means recognized the difference between opposition to <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government by <b>the</b> Miskito, Sumo, and Rama on one hand, and the Reagan administration's support of the Contras, dedicated to the overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> regime.|$|R

25|$|They {{engaged in}} a {{systematic}} campaign of terror amongst the rural Nicaraguan population to disrupt the social reform projects of <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas.</b> Several historians have criticized the contra campaign and the Reagan administration's support for it, citing the brutality and numerous human rights violations of the contras. LaRamee and Polakoff, for example, describe the destruction of health centers, schools, and cooperatives {{at the hands of}} the rebels, and others have contended that murder, rape, and torture occurred on a large scale in contra-dominated areas. The United States also carried out a campaign of economic sabotage, and disrupted shipping by planting underwater mines in Nicaragua's port of Corinto, an action condemned by the International Court of Justice as illegal. The U.S. also sought to place economic pressure on <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> and the Reagan administration imposed a full trade embargo. <b>The</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> were also accused of human rights abuses.|$|E

25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> {{encouraged}} grassroots pluralism, {{they were}} perhaps less enthusiastic about national elections. They argued that popular support was {{expressed in the}} insurrection and that further appeals to popular support {{would be a waste}} of scarce resources. International pressure and domestic opposition eventually pressed the government toward a national election. Tomás Borge warned that the elections were a concession, an act of generosity and of political necessity. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> had little to fear from the election given the advantages of incumbency and the restrictions on the opposition, and they hoped to discredit the armed efforts to overthrow them.|$|E
50|$|Many LGBT Nicaraguans held {{prominent}} roles during <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> Revolution; however, LGBT {{rights were}} not a priority to <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> Government because <b>the</b> {{majority of the population}} were Roman Catholic.

On the tenth anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> Revolution (1989), many community centers were launched for LGBT people. The centers began to form after a march by activists that took place in Managua.|$|R
