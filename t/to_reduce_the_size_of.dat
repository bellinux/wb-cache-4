The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time.

The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.|$|E

The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> {{the armed forces to}} boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued {{until the end of the}} war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber {{within the confines of}} its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, {{the regiment}} was reconstituted on 22 February 1916 when all three squadrons assembled at Heliopolis. Under a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Royston– {{a veteran of}} the Boer War who had replaced Abbott after the latter had been sent to England– the regiment began to re-form. At the time of re-forming, it had been intended that the 12th would be assigned to the 5th Division as its divisional light horse regiment; however, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> divisional light horse components to a squadron, and the 12th were removed from the 5th Division's order of battle. Although other units, such as part of the 4th and all of the 13th Light Horse Regiment, were sent to Europe to fight on the Western Front, the 12th, along with the bulk of the Australian light horse units, were to remain in the Middle East, where they would take part in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. Initially, the regiment was not brigaded and served as a detached unit.|$|E

His first Football League goal followed later in the month in Chester's 2–2 draw with Wycombe Wanderers, scoring from eight yards to restore parity in the match. Holroyd scored his second goal {{of the season in}} a 5–3 defeat at Morecambe, as well as twice in a 3–3 draw at Accrington Stanley. He also made a further two assists towards the latter stages of the 2007–08 campaign in victories against Mansfield Town and Darlington respectively. Holroyd played 26 games in all competitions for Chester during the season, scoring five times. In July 2008, he was transfer-listed by the club in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> their squad. A day after being transfer-listed, Holroyd left Chester by mutual agreement with a year remaining on his contract, while being linked with a transfer to other clubs.

5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 48 Centrifugal {{compressor}} and turbine {{manufacturers are}} building machines that operate at increasingly higher speeds <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> {{and cost of}} their equipment. Helical gears are commonly used to step down the speed of these machines to match nominal motor and generator speeds.

The increase in pitch line velocities and tooth loadings has not been without problems. Several new and updated American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) standards have been published to educate end users on the issues with high-speed helical gears and to provide consistent criteria for rating gears. One of the key issues is lubrication and cooling.
