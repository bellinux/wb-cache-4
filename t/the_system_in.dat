40|$|Hyper{{entanglement}}, {{defined as}} the entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, has attracted much attention recently. Here we investigate the possibility of concentrating <b>the</b> two-photon four-qubit <b>systems</b> <b>in</b> partially hyperentangled states in both the spatial mode and the polarization DOFs with linear optics. We first introduce our parameter-splitting method to concentrate <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> partially hyperentangled states with known parameters, including partially hyperentangled Bell states and cluster states. Subsequently, we present another two nonlocal hyperentanglement concentration protocols (hyper-ECPs) for <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>in</b> partially hyperentangled unknown states, resorting to the Schmidt projection method. It will be shown that our parameter-splitting method is very efficient for the concentration of <b>the</b> quantum <b>systems</b> <b>in</b> partially entangled states with known parameters, resorting to linear-optical elements only. All these four hyper-ECPs are feasible with current technology {{and they may be}} useful in long-distance quantum communication based on hyperentanglement as they require only linear optical elements.
