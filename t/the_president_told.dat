5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>told</b> her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E
25|$|The next day, on 6 November, {{people kept}} protesting, {{although}} in fewer numbers (6,000 in Bucharest and several thousands in other cities). <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>told</b> the civil representatives {{that he will}} come incognito {{to talk to people}} in the streets, indirectly hinting that if they want true change they need to keep asking for it so the politicians can't pretend they don't understand what is asked of them.|$|E

Obama, however, decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain operational security for the operation against bin Laden.

500|$|John F. Kennedy, {{the only}} Catholic {{to be elected}} President of the United States, was a Fourth Degree member of Bunker Hill Council No. 62 and Bishop Cheverus General Assembly. Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart visited Kennedy at the White House on Columbus Day, 1961. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>told</b> Hart that his younger brother, Ted Kennedy, had {{received}} [...] "his Third Degree in our Order three weeks before".

500|$|Several {{officials}} who {{were present in}} the Situation Room, including <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>told</b> reporters that the code name for bin Laden was [...] "Geronimo". They had watched Leon Panetta, speaking from CIA headquarters, while he narrated the action in Abbottabad. Panetta said, [...] "We have a visual on Geronimo", and later, [...] "Geronimo EKIA"—enemy killed in action. The words of the commander on the ground were, [...] "For God and country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo." [...] Officials subsequently explained that each step of the mission was labelled alphabetically in an [...] "Execution Checklist", which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic. [...] "Geronimo" [...] indicated the raiders had reached step [...] "G", the capture or killing of bin Laden. Osama bin Laden was identified as [...] "Jackpot", the general code name for the target of an operation. ABC News reported that otherwise his regular code name was [...] "Cakebread". The New Yorker reported that bin Laden's codename was [...] "Crankshaft".|$|E
500|$|During the war, McKinley also {{pursued the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself. There was strong American support for annexation, {{and the need}} for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress. The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, [...] "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing... a firmness in pursuing it"; <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>told</b> Cortelyou, [...] "We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny." ...|$|E

50|$|In April 2014, Frakt was a {{candidate}} for the deanship of Florida Coastal School of Law. In the middle of giving a presentation where he described his ideas for addressing major problems at the school such as declining enrollment, reduced admission standards, and low morale, he was reportedly stopped by <b>the</b> school's <b>president,</b> <b>told</b> to stop “insulting” the faculty, and was then asked to leave.|$|R
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>told</b> him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 25 June, Árbenz called {{a meeting of the}} senior leaders of the government, the {{political}} parties, and the labor unions. Colonel Díaz was also present. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>told</b> them that the army at Zacapa had abandoned the government, and that the civilian population needed to be armed in order to defend the country. Díaz raised no objections, and the unions pledged several thousand troops between them. When the troops were mustered the next day, only a few hundred showed up. The civilian population of the capital had fought alongside the Guatemalan Revolution twice before—during the popular uprising of 1944, and again during the attempted coup of 1949—but on this occasion the army, intimidated by the United States, refused to fight. The union members were reluctant to fight both the invasion and their own military. Seeing this, Díaz reneged on his support of the President, and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to Árbenz and informed him of their decision. Árbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed without demur. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8pm on 27 June 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later. In it, he stated that he was resigning in order to eliminate the [...] "pretext for the invasion", and that he wished to preserve the gains of the October Revolution of 1944. He walked to the nearby Mexican Embassy, seeking political asylum. Two months later he was granted safe passage out of the country, and flew to exile in Mexico. Some 120 Árbenz loyalists or communists were also allowed to leave, and none of the assassination plans contemplated by the CIA were actually implemented.|$|E

5000|$|The crisis saw the December 2009 {{resignation}} {{of a government}} minister, Jesse Chacón, upon the arrest of his brother Arné Chacón {{in relation to a}} banking corruption scandal.

2500|$|After {{listening}} {{to the idea of}} intercepting the EgyptAir jet, Reagan approved the operation in principle in what was called the [...] "Sara Lee decision". Reagan's decision style was to reflect the broad-bush issues and leave details to his staff and Poindexter was tasked with fulfilling the President's decision. North was to remain in contact with Simhoni for any situational changes regarding the hijackers. Poindexter called Vice Admiral Art Moreau (then serving as assistant to Admiral William J. Crowe – the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). Poindexter, on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> <b>told</b> Moreau that Crowe was to start planning an intercept mission.|$|E
2500|$|One {{historian}} has written, however, {{that when}} Murrow met Roosevelt with William J. Donovan of the OSS that night, while {{the magnitude of}} the destruction at Pearl Harbor horrified the president, Roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men. According to Murrow, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>told</b> him [...] "Maybe you think [...] didn't surprise us!" [...] He said later, [...] "I believed him", and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness. When allegations of Roosevelt's foreknowledge appeared after the war, John Gunther asked Murrow about the meeting. He reportedly responded that the full story would pay for his son's college education and [...] "if you think I'm {{going to give it to}} you, you're out of your mind". Murrow did not write the story, however, before his death.|$|E
2500|$|At 1:00p.m. CST, Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead after all activity had ceased and after Huber had administered Extreme Unction. Personnel at Parkland Hospital Trauma Room #1, who treated the President, observed that the president's condition was [...] "moribund", meaning he had no chance of survival upon arrival at the hospital. [...] "We never had any hope of saving his life," [...] Dr. Perry said. [...] "I am absolutely sure he never knew what hit him," [...] said Dr. Tom Shires, Parkland's chief of surgery. The Very Reverend Oscar L. Huber, the priest who administered the last rites to <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>told</b> The New York Times {{that the president was}} already dead upon the priest's arrival at the hospital.

When <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>told</b> him that he had been selected to undertake the difficult and delicate mission of discovering the whereabouts of Montagu Trixit, and, if possible, procuring an interview with him, he was amazed.

60|$|Under these circumstances, the Society resolved, after a {{quantity}} of meeting and debating, that Jane should be requested to cut Old Cheeseman dead; and that if she refused, she must be sent to Coventry herself. So a deputation, headed by the President, was appointed to wait on Jane, and inform her of the vote the Society had been under the painful necessity of passing. She was very much respected for all her good qualities, {{and there was a}} story about her having once waylaid the Reverend in his own study, and got a fellow off from severe punishment, of her own kind comfortable heart. So the deputation didn't much like the job. However, they went up, and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>told</b> Jane all about it. Upon which Jane turned very red, burst into tears, informed the President and the deputation, in a way not at all like her usual way, that they were a parcel of malicious young savages, and turned the whole respected body out of the room. Consequently it was entered in the Society's book (kept in astronomical cypher for fear of detection), that all communication with Jane was interdicted: and the President addressed the members on this convincing instance of Old Cheeseman's undermining.|$|E
60|$|While {{commanding}} in West Tennessee we had occasionally held conversations {{over the}} wires, at night, {{when they were}} not being otherwise used. He and General Halleck both cautioned me against giving the President my plans of campaign, saying that he was so kind-hearted, so averse to refusing anything asked of him, that some friend would be sure to get from him all he knew. I should have said that in our interview <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>told</b> me {{he did not want to}} know what I proposed to do. But he submitted a plan of campaign of his own which he wanted me to hear and then do as I pleased about. He brought out a map of Virginia on which he had evidently marked every position occupied by the Federal and Confederate armies up to that time. He pointed out on the map two streams which empty into the Potomac, and suggested that the army might be moved on boats and landed between the mouths of these streams. We would then have the Potomac to bring our supplies, and the tributaries would protect our flanks while we moved out. I listened respectfully, but did not suggest that the same streams would protect Lee's flanks while he was shutting us up.|$|E
