In this paper, the data of the research that was conducted by the end of the year 2013 has been used. 1935 respondents took part in the survey – representatives of the leading business sectors in Latvia and representatives of the large and medium-sized enterprises.

50|$|Where {{outsourcing}} {{involves the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undertaking, it {{is subject to}} Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v.
