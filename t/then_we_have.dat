5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no reason for assuming that {{they are also the}} consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
25|$|That's the way graded-index fibers work: {{the change}} in the {{refractive}} index introduces a focusing effect that can balance the natural diffraction of the field. If the two effects balance each other perfectly, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a confined field propagating within the fiber.|$|E
25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no control over {{the events of the}} past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the legs}} are equal, so are their squares. So {{in order for}} the Pythagorean theorem to work for this special right triangle, the square of the {{hypotenuse}} has to be an even number (and if we cut it in half once <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the area of the square of the leg).|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of {{our thoughts}} are {{the effect of a}} physical cause, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it (or anything else), except by a fluke.|$|E
25|$|If {{we want to}} fix {{the value}} of n prior to the {{experiment}} <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to take the balls one by one until we have n balls. The balls are therefore no longer independent. This gives a slightly different distribution known as Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution. It is far from obvious why these two distributions are different. See the entry for noncentral hypergeometric distributions for {{an explanation of the}} difference between these two distributions and a discussion of which distribution to use in various situations.|$|E

25|$|Thus we {{have the}} President of the Reorganized Church and son of Joseph Smith admitting, as well as apologizing for the rash {{statements}} {{of his father and}} other leaders in the old church, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Joseph F. Smith of the Utah church using about the same argument to excuse the language and murderous conduct of the Danites in Utah. All we care to say is reply to both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the Danite Band, then we believe the public is justified in denouncing such language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{the edges}} of a {{complete}} graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, v. There are 5 edges incident to v and so (by the pigeonhole principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. Without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, v, to vertices, r, s and t, are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (r, s), (r, t), (s, t), are also blue <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red {{and we have an}} entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, any K6 contains a monochromatic K3, and therefore R(3, 3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' arrest. Eight statues {{tell the}} story of Jesus' arrest. First, we have a helmeted guard in armour who holds a rope in his hand and to his left is Saint Peter brandishing the sword with which he has cut off Malchus' ear. Then we see Jesus and Judas and at their feet Malchus who has fallen {{backward}} to the ground after being struck by Saint Peter and has dropped the lantern he was carrying. He tries to steady himself by holding on Jesus' arm. Judas stands close to Jesus holding the purse no doubt containing the reward for his treachery. He has either kissed Jesus or is about to do so. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> three other guards who will make the arrest. The one in the middle holds a sword. Jesus is then led before Caiaphas who is seated and holds a sceptre and wears a crown, symbols of his power.|$|E

500|$|Composer David Bell created {{music for}} the episode that had echoes of the operas of 19th-century German {{composer}} Richard Wagner. He explained that he used [...] "Wagner opera vocabulary in the orchestrations, and... actually used Wagner tubas in the score". He used religious tones to accompany appearances of the sword itself, specifically when it is first found by Worf, and said, [...] "If the audience isn't made to understand the spiritual importance of that weapon, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no episode".|$|E

Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating [...] " [...] a fantastic atmosphere" [...] but added, [...] "I have got to have a conversation with him because I don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition." [...] However, Bruce also said that, because of the money Allam had invested in the club, [...] "If he thinks Hull Tigers is his way forward <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to respect it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to really sit down and be as meticulous as we all want to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's {{one of the things}} [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{community}} of Mangalore accused the police of doing {{nothing to prevent}} attacks by Hindu radicals. Mangalore Police Superintendent N. Satheesh Kumar himself admitted that the police did have information that pro-Hindu organisations were planning to attack Christian places of worship in the district, but failed {{to do anything about}} it. The Christian community accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under B. S. Yeddyurappa of involvement in the attacks and backing the anti-Christian campaigns. In response to the report that the police had information, Fr. Henry Sequeira, chancellor of the Mangalore Diocese said, [...] "If the police knew about this in advance and still could not prevent the attacks, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no hope." [...] However, Superintendent Kumar had made security arrangements near the New Life Prayer Centre in Kankanady and had successfully barred the miscreants from entering and vandalising the centre at that particular location, leading to a violent conflict with the police. The police were also criticised by Christians for using excessive force in suppressing the protests and aggressively subduing Christian protesters whilst failing to punish the offending Hindu nationalist perpetrators; photographs and video footage has emerged of the beating of some of the protestors with canes. Caning by the police was also reported at Panemangalore and Farangipet.|$|E

The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to change it." ...|$|E
