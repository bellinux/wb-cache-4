5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. <b>This</b> <b>style</b> was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses <b>this</b> <b>style.</b> Korean dance crew Prepix also uses <b>this</b> <b>style.</b> They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E

50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{original}} ASCII space, the other spaces are all compatibility characters. In this context this means that they effectively add no semantic content to the text, but instead provide styling control. Within Unicode, <b>this</b> non-semantic <b>styling</b> control {{is often referred to}} as rich text and is outside the thrust of Unicode’s goals. Rather than using different spaces in different contexts, <b>this</b> <b>styling</b> should instead be handled through intelligent text layout software.|$|R

5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair {{in front of}} his ears to his {{mustache}} but with the chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to describe <b>this</b> <b>style.</b> The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E
5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in <b>this</b> <b>style,</b> characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make <b>this</b> <b>style</b> popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, the Boston {{architectural}} firm Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson {{was awarded a}} major construction contract that set the predominantly neogothic architectural style still seen today. Most of the buildings of the central cadet area are in <b>this</b> <b>style,</b> as typified by the Cadet Chapel, completed in 1910. These buildings are nearly all constructed from granite that has a predominantly gray and black hue. The barracks that {{were built in the}} 1960s were designed to mimic <b>this</b> <b>style.</b> Other buildings on post, notably the oldest private residences for the faculty, are built in the Federal, Georgian, or English Tudor styles. A few buildings, such as Cullum Hall and the Old Cadet Chapel, are built in the Neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} <b>this</b> <b>style</b> {{incorporates}} {{elements that are}} clearly from a different period.

50|$|The B9 Tribeca {{featured}} a triangular grille and a rounded body shape. Subaru {{also used the}} grille styling on the Impreza, and the Japanese market Subaru R1 and R2 kei car products.

5|$|Sculptures of the Potbelly style {{are found}} {{all along the}} Pacific Coast from {{southern}} Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that <b>this</b> <b>style</b> is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that <b>this</b> <b>style</b> began to be used {{at the end of}} the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at Monte Alto in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of Art Nouveau, had a certain {{influence}} on {{much of the new}} construction in Norway {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in <b>this</b> <b>style</b> and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in <b>this</b> <b>style,</b> such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E

While the sound of the JAKE years had been influenced by folk rock, jazz, and shoegaze, this new single displayed hard electronic and industrial influences. <b>This</b> electro-industrial <b>style</b> was further expanded upon on the band's 1998 LP, Dazzle, and their 1999 LP, Fickle Boon.|$|R

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to <b>this</b> <b>style</b> of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{system for}} the Church of England was {{approved}} in 1976. The traditions of Eastern Christian heraldry have less developed regulation.
