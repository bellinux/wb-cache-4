5|$|Newcastle's Freewheels Theatre {{commissioned}} Nick Enright {{to produce}} a play that explored themes around <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> murder. Titled A Property of the Clan, it premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in Newcastle in 1992, and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993. The title {{was taken from the}} controversial quote in the psychological report on Webster made in preparation for his trial. Enright omitted the criminal acts and the murder from the play, instead focusing on the drama, its participants and the aftermath of the murder. The play was shown at various high schools in the Newcastle area, and following its positive reception was shown at high schools nationally, winning several awards. However, Newcastle High School, where both Leigh and Webster had been students, declined to show it. The play is set in the fictional town of Blackrock, and <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> murder victim is named Tracy. Leigh's family requested that the name be changed, as 'Tracey' was the name of Leigh's cousin and best friend. The name remained, despite other revisions to the script; the play was retitled Blackrock. It was performed by the Sydney Theatre Company in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was ruled by a {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because of <b>the</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>and</b> this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may be nothing more than a legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been ruled by a series of kings, who probably were, as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E

5|$|Licence to Kill (1989) is {{the sixteenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond film series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, and the last to star Timothy Dalton {{in the role of}} the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is the first one not to use the title of an Ian Fleming story. It is also the fifth and final consecutive Bond film to be directed by John Glen. The story has elements of two Ian Fleming short stories and a novel, interwoven with aspects from Japanese Rōnin tales. The film sees Bond being suspended from MI6 as he pursues drugs lord Franz Sanchez, who has ordered an attack against his CIA friend Felix Leiter and <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> murder of Felix's wife during their honeymoon. Originally titled Licence Revoked in line with the plot, the name was changed during post-production due to American test audiences associating the term with driving.|$|E

While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about <b>the</b> <b>rape,</b> <b>and</b> that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India at the time of <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> murder and that after having worked {{every day of my life}} for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> murder of Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various {{people involved in}} the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action.

In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> murder of Fryer; the confession was published {{the next day in}} Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{enjoys a}} fling with Freddie and then soon begin a relationship. The pair {{get into a}} feud with Grace Black (Tamara Wall) and Trevor over The Loft, which they work in and run. Mercedes is left angry and {{disappointed}} when she walks in on Lindsey and Freddie kissing. When Mercedes discovers that Freddie killed Grace's father Fraser Black (Jesse Birdsall) for his mistreatment of his mother, Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth), she uses this information to blackmail him.

Mercedes enters the hospital dressed as a doctor and helps Theresa escape, but Sonny tracks them down. Myra, who has returned from Spain, knocks Sonny unconscious and the three women try to escape, but the police catch them and Theresa is returned to prison although they are eventually able to get her released by making it look as though Sonny manipulated her in to confessing. Mercedes supports John Paul when he reveals that he was raped {{by one of his}} students, Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) and Mercedes starts a feud with Finn's stepmother Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), who protests Finn's innocence. Mercedes, Myra, Nana and Carmel publicly embarrass Diane and support John Paul in court at Finn's trial, when Finn protests his innocence and lies, claiming that John Paul molested him, but Finn is found guilty for <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> sent to prison.|$|E
