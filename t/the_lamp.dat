5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into <b>the</b> <b>lamp,</b> which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of <b>the</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium iodide and {{dysprosium}} bromide {{are used}} in high-intensity metal-halide lamps.

5|$|Thallium iodide is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} additive in metal-halide lamps, often together {{with one or two}} halides of other metals. It allows optimization of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> temperature and color rendering, and shifts the spectral output to the green region, which is useful for underwater lighting.|$|E

5|$|Realizing that he {{will become}} Sultan, Aladdin refuses to free the Genie. Iago steals <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan and become the world's most {{powerful}} sorcerer, exposing Aladdin's identity and exiling him, Abu and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. However, they escape {{and return to the}} palace. There, Jafar wishes Genie for his final wish to make Jasmine fall in love with him, but the Genie refuses to grant the wish. Upon noticing Aladdin, Jasmine pretends to be interested to distract Jafar and Aladdin tries to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>lamp,</b> but Jafar stops Aladdin and traps Jasmine inside an hourglass. Jafar transforms into a giant cobra and tells Aladdin that he is the most powerful being in the world. However, Aladdin replies that the Genie is more powerful than him. Jafar uses his last wish to become a genie and create his own lamp. Aladdin frees Jasmine, and uses Jafar's lamp to trap the latter and Iago.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{terracotta}} <b>lamps</b> found at <b>the</b> archaeological site of Agia Paraskevi of Arachamitai {{during the years}} 2010 – 2014. The research questions are: What kind of lamps were used on the site and when? For what purposes were <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> used? Where were they manufactured? In order to address these questions, a total of fifty lamps have been chosen to form {{the body of research}} material. To answer the first research question, a typology for these lamps has been created with twenty-one types and one variant, after examining various lamp typologies and previous publications. The find contexts and distribution of <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> are both examined to test the dates for <b>the</b> different <b>lamp</b> types gathered from other publications, and to answer the question on what purposes <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> were used on the site. Visual observation of the clay of <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> and information on clay materials from other sites are both examined to determine the lamps' origins. <b>The</b> <b>lamps</b> in this study date from the 5 th century BC to the 2 nd century AD. The find contexts allow the dating of <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> according to <b>the</b> other publications, but suggestions of more site-specific dates are given to some <b>lamps.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> indicates that while most were used for everyday lighting at the sanctuary, some may have had ritual connections. Most of <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> were manufactured locally or at a nearby Arcadian site. Few lamps can be regarded as imports...|$|R

Nor was there, upon pain of death, any other fire to be used there (Lev 10:1,2). These tongs, therefore, were used to take fire from off the altar to light <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> and candlesticks withal. For to trim the lights, and to dress <b>the</b> <b>lamps,</b> was Aaron's work day by day. He shall light and order <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> upon <b>the</b> pure candlestick before the Lord, and Aaron did so. He lighted <b>the</b> seven <b>lamps</b> thereof, as <b>the</b> Lord commanded Moses (Exo 10:24,25; Lev 24:2,3; Num 8:3). What is a lamp or candlestick to us, if there be not light thereon; and how lighted without fire, and how shall we take up coals to light <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> withal, if we have not tongs prepared for that purpose? With these tongs fire also was taken from off the altar, and put into the censers to burn sweet incense with, before the Lord. The tongs then were of great use in {{the temple of the}} Lord.|$|R
