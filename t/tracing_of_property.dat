The {{fact that}} symbols in the {{modulation}} space M 1, 1 generate pseudo-differential operators <b>of</b> the <b>trace</b> class was first mentioned by Feichtinger and the proof {{was given by}} Gröchenig [12].

The result with α = 0 corresponds to that of Gröchenig, and the one with α = 1 is a new result which states the <b>trace</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> the operators with symbols in the Besov space.

40|$|Computer {{security}} policies {{often are}} stated informally {{in terms of}} conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of information and resources; these policies can be qualitative or quantitative. To formally quantify conﬁdentiality and integrity, {{a new model of}} quantitative information ﬂow is proposed in which information ﬂow is quantiﬁed as the change in the accuracy of an observer’s beliefs. This new model resolves anomalies present in previous quantitative informationﬂow models, which are based on change in uncertainty. And the new model is sufﬁciently general that it can be instantiated to measure either accuracy or uncertainty. To formalize security policies in general, a generalization of the theory <b>of</b> <b>trace</b> <b>properties</b> (originally developed for program veriﬁcation) is proposed. Security policies are modeled as hyperproperties, which are sets <b>of</b> <b>trace</b> <b>properties.</b> Although important security policies, such as secure information ﬂow, cannot be expressed as trace properties, they can be expressed as hyperproperties. Safety and liveness are generalized from trace properties to hyperproperties, and every hyperproperty is shown to be the intersection of a safety hyperproperty and a liveness hyperproperty. Veriﬁcation, reﬁnement, and topology of hyperproperties are also addressed. Hyperproperties for system representations beyond trace sets are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} a cryptanalytical technique for distinguishing some stream ciphers from a truly random process. Roughly, the ciphers {{to which this}} method applies consist of a &quot;non-linear process &quot; (say, akin to a round function in block ciphers), and a &quot;linear process &quot; such as an LFSR (or even fixed tables). The output of the cipher can be the linear sum of both processes. To attack such ciphers, we look for any <b>property</b> <b>of</b> the &quot;non-linear process &quot; that can be distinguished from random. In addition, we look for a linear combination of the linear process that vanishes. We then consider the same linear combination applied to the cipher's output, {{and try to find}} <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> the distinguishing <b>property...</b>|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{frameworks}} are applications {{which can}} be used to visualise complex systems during the design stage. They can be used to derive emergent <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> systems as well as providing valuable high-level system metrics. Frameworks of models facilitate the <b>tracing</b> <b>of</b> system <b>properties</b> and aspects such as design decisions. The Newcastle Engineering Design Centre has developed and constructed a modelling framework. Developed with early design conceptualisation in mind it soon became apparent that frameworks could be extended for use {{in other areas of the}} design processes. This paper describes the modelling framework and its capabilities. This scope is extended to include requirements traceability, which necessitate a level of documentation attached to a framework representation of a system. For future work we consider extending the information system to encompass the product lifecycle and suggest some advantages this will bring to understanding lifecycle issues such as manufacturing, implementation, validation and operational requirements. This direction will allow an increase in the transparency of the product lifecycle. The work to date has extended the uses of modelling frameworks to many aspects of the design process and shows that frameworks can be deployed throughout the lifecycle of products related to complex systems...|$|R

40|$|Security {{protocols}} are {{concurrent processes}} that communicate using cryptography {{with the aim}} of achieving various security properties. Recent work on their formal verification has brought procedures and tools for deciding trace equivalence properties (e. g. anonymity, unlinkability, vote secrecy) for a bounded number of sessions. However, these procedures are based on a naive symbolic exploration <b>of</b> all <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> the considered processes which, unsurprisingly, greatly limits the scalability and practical impact of the verification tools. In this paper, we mitigate this difficulty by developing partial order reduction techniques for the verification of security protocols. We provide reduced transition systems that optimally eliminate redundant traces, and which are adequate for model-checking <b>trace</b> equivalence <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> protocols by means of symbolic execution. We have implemented our reductions in the tool Apte, and demonstrated that it achieves the expected speedup on various protocols...|$|R

This body is now strongly suspected to be that of one Henry Cass, a disreputable character, who has since been ascertained to {{have been one of the}} road agents who escaped. The matter is now under legal investigation. The successful result of the search is due to a systematic plan evolved from the genius of Mr. Beard, who has devoted over a year to this labor.
