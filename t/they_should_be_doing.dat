5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about what <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos {{see this as an}} opportunity to strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E

5000|$|The First Way- The media {{takes on}} the {{responsibility}} of keeping sexuality, sexual attitudes, and sexual behaviors {{at the forefront of}} the public eye.

Finally, failures can be caused by customers who do not understand the process and do not know what <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing.</b> For example, a customer might fail to provide appropriate documents to an appointment with a bank manager or lawyer.|$|E

50|$|Ingenioso {{has found}} a kind of patron in Gullio, a {{character}} that is partly based on Thomas Nashe’s portrait of “an upstart” in his pamphlet Pierce Penniless. Gullio “maintains” Ingenioso very neglectfully. Foppishly dressed Gullio falsely boasts of being a valiant, noble and romantic character. Ingenioso offers himself as a poet to memorialize Gullio in sonnets. Gullio then persuades Ingenioso to impersonate his mistress, Lesbia, while Gullio rehearses love poetry that Gullio himself has written and derived from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and Venus and Adonis. Gullio plans to eventually recite these verses {{as part of his}} wooing of Lesbia. In the next scene, Consiliodorus, father to Philomusus, uncle to Studioso, who funded their journey to Parnassus meets with the carrier and horse-back messenger Leonarde. Leonarde reports that he scolded Philomusus and Studioso and reminded them that their nurturing was costly. Leonarde thinks they may have found jobs as clerks.

25|$|Caesarean section, {{also known}} as C-section or {{caesarean}} delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies.

A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible.
