5|$|Besides {{the legal}} {{services}} rendered by Don Felipe to <b>the</b> <b>impoverished,</b> Agoncillo {{and her daughters}} observed every Thursday as a day of charity, when a queue of needy people seeking alms would form in the Agoncillo driveway. No one ever left their house empty-handed. Agoncillo would hand them a bag of rice {{in addition to the}} money she gave them. This practice lasted until the couple retired.|$|E
5|$|Response to {{the reforms}} was mixed. The {{religious}} houses {{had been the}} only support of <b>the</b> <b>impoverished,</b> and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536–1537, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553–1558).|$|E
5|$|The Whitechapel murders were {{committed}} {{in or near}} <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> Whitechapel district in the East End of London between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891.

5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{recession}} which began in 1893, and which continued through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%. The task of relieving the jobless fell to churches and other charities, {{as well as to}} labor unions. Farmers went bankrupt; their farms were sold to pay their debts. Some of <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Juan Perón decided to {{campaign}} for {{the presidency of the}} nation, which he won in a landslide. Eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Perón's movement. Though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success, she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> classes.|$|E
5|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{people with}} low levels of education living in poorer areas are most at risk for elevated lead. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are <b>the</b> <b>impoverished,</b> city-dwellers, and immigrants. African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E

5|$|John Joseph Broderick {{was born}} on Manhattan's East 25th Street, in <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> Gashouse District, the son of Margaret Kendall and Michael Broderick. At the age of 12 he left parochial school to drive a brick truck, and then a coal truck, to support his mother {{after the death of}} his father. He served in the U.S. Navy in World War I and worked as a {{bodyguard}} for Samuel Gompers, the labor leader. He joined the New York City Fire Department in April 1922, but found that boring. Having taken both the Fire and Police Department examinations, in January of the following year he joined the New York City Police Department.|$|E

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing that many of <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E

Initially planning to depart for distant lands, a vision of Christ leads him to aid <b>the</b> <b>impoverished.</b> Freed from the Devil, he becomes a minister and marries Edna.|$|E
5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous alleys and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both a necessity {{and an opportunity to}} beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E

5|$|Enlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, {{he served}} as sailor aboard the USS Vandalia and the {{captured}} Confederate vessel USS Beauregard, maintaining the blockade of the ports of the Confederacy. He was discharged from service in 1865 after receiving an injury, which developed into a chronic condition in later life. Unable to immediately return home, <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> Bush {{took more than a}} decade to return to Hawaii, journeying through New England and much of the Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of Kauai, where he settled down. In later life he converted to Mormonism and became {{an active member of the}} Hawaiian Mission. After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his service and granted a government pension in 1905 for the injuries he received in the Navy. He died at his home on Kauai, on April 24, 1906.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E
5|$|He faced {{a similar}} {{challenge}} with <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of restoring {{the viability of the}} diocese and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established {{a reputation as one of}} the most active Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood. After his death, he received veneration as a saint himself, although he was never formally canonised.|$|E

25|$|In 1260, control {{passed to}} the Egyptian Mamluks and until 1291 Palestine became the {{frontier}} between Mongol invaders (occasional Crusader allies). <b>The</b> conflict <b>impoverished</b> <b>the</b> country and severely reduced the population.

50|$|The {{second and}} last Prince Lopukhin, Paul, was granted {{the right to}} pass his title and name to his great-nephew, Nikolai Demidoff, a {{representative}} of another branch of this industrialist clan. <b>The</b> revolution <b>impoverished</b> <b>the</b> princes Lopukhin-Demidov, who settled in Finland where they (for a while) owned the manor of Anttolanhovi near Mikkeli.

5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's {{not one of the}} Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's hoarding of the food supply to the Ethiopians, who then take control of the food supply.|$|E
5|$|The Kiautschou Bay concession, as {{it became}} known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the {{imperial}} province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (Schantung-Halbinsel) in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{his fellow}} band members, Fafa – born 13 May 1954 in Ampasamadinika, a {{neighborhood}} of Antananarivo – has based his career entirely around singing. He {{was raised in a}} musical family: his father played mandolin and his mother enjoyed singing. Fafa began playing guitar at the age of nine and sang along with popular European and American artists on the radio, including Harry Belafonte, Claude François and Mike Brant. Fafa discontinued his studies after the 1972 rotaka and returned with his wife and son (born in 1973) to live with his parents in Antananarivo. There he obtained a position at the Ministry of Transportation, becoming the first salaried member of the group. For the first three decades of his career, Fafa often recorded and performed in collaboration with other artists and groups. He released his first solo album in 2008 to strong sales across Madagascar. In the late 1990s Fafa led a successful campaign to increase access to public latrines in <b>the</b> <b>impoverished</b> Antananarivo neighborhood of Isotry.|$|E
