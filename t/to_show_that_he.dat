5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence has been used <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment {{for the performance of}} his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E

He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the cross <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E

5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|Brown, Barnes and Morris {{shared the}} opening duties against the visiting Indians; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. With Brown recovered, the Australian {{selectors}} dropped Barnes {{for the first}} two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 runsAustralia batted once in both Testsand was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morriswhose place was securewas rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another chance <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 40 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour, though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wifestill living in Scotlandbefore he was confirmed. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.|$|E
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E
5|$|On the day Alexander was born, Philip was {{preparing}} a siege {{on the city}} of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia {{to say that it}} had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.|$|E
5|$|Rovers won {{once again}} in an away game against Upton Park at West Ham Park by a {{scoreline}} of 3–0 in the fifth round. The match was more competitive than the scoreline might suggest, as Blackburn were a goal down at half time but won the game after a goal by John Inglis and two by Joe Lofthouse in the second half. At Birmingham in a neutral venue, they defeated Notts County in the semi-final 1–0. As with Olympic against Queen's Park, Notts also complained of events that took place during their semi-final. They argued that Rovers had illegally fielded Inglis, a player from Glasgow who had played for Rangers and was only drafted it to the Blackburn team to improve their cup performance. A letter was produced by Rovers <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been expelled from Rangers because he continued {{to play for the}} English team instead. Notts wanted the match to be replayed without Inglis, but the FA did not uphold the complaint.|$|E

5|$|During the Australian {{season of}} 194748, which preceded {{the tour of}} England, Morris played {{in the first four}} Tests against the touring Indians, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the {{selectors}} wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a batting average of 52.25, making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 40. During the series, he had opened with both Bill Brown, the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate Sid Barnes. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another chance <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was worthy of selection.
