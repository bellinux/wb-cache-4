5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room,</b> usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E

25|$|Norwegian Air Shuttle {{established}} a base at Rygge on 14 February 2008, {{with a second}} aircraft being stationed at the airport from 13 March. From February to April, Norwegian Air Shuttle started international flights to Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Belgrade, Budapest, Istanbul, London, Málaga, Marrakech, Palanga, Szczecin, Valencia, Warsaw, with between two and four weekly services to each destination. In addition, the airline started two daily services to Bergen. Norwegian's services to Belgrade, Istanbul, Marrakech, Szczecin and Valencia were all terminated at Gardermoen {{the same time as}} they opened at Rygge. The airport stated that they had also been approached by Ryanair, who wanted to move the bulk of their services from Torp, but the airport stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for only one airline, and that they had prioritized Norwegian.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{a meticulous}} and {{accurate}} draughtsman {{and one of}} the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the Sassetti Chapel at Santa Trinita and the Tornabuoni Chapel at Santa Maria Novella. In these cycles of the Life of St Francis and the Life of the Virgin Mary and Life of John the Baptist <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, Lorenzo il Magnifico, and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, Agnolo Poliziano. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.|$|E

25|$|St. Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel {{was opened}} in 1871 in Breckfield Road North, Everton, Liverpool. The chapel took {{its name from}} its {{location}} {{on the corner of}} Breckfield Road North and St. Domingo Vale. St. Domingo related addresses in Everton have their origins in St. Domingo House, a building built in 1758 by West Indies trader and sugar boiler George Campbell who would frequent the Colony of Santo Domingo and later became Mayor of Liverpool (1763). In 1877 Rev. Ben Swift Chambers was appointed Minister of St. Domingo Chapel. He created a cricket team for the youngsters in the area but, as cricket was only played in summer, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for another sport during winter. Thus a football club called St. Domingo F.C. was formed in 1878, the club's first match being a 1-0 home victory over Everton Church Club.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, The Chez Show {{originated}} from the Chez Paree nightclub on North Fairbanks in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. It {{was one of}} Chicago's top night spots, as celebrities of all genres could be found there, either as performers or as patrons. The original hosts of this weekday late-night interview program were Mike Wallace and his wife, Buff Cobb. In 1951, Jack Eigen (1913-1983) took over as host of the program, a position he held {{for most of the}} next 20 years. After the Chez Paree closed in the spring of 1960 and never re-opened, the program became The Jack Eigen Show and the interviews continued from WMAQ's Studio G, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> enough for a small audience, and from Chicago's Sherman House hotel; their College Inn was another popular local venue for entertainment and entertainers.|$|E
25|$|As a prefecture, Shizuoka had {{historically}} {{been a strong}} footballing area of Japan; in particular being noted for its nationally successful high school teams and the numerous national team players which had emerged from the prefecture over the years. The prefectural police force of Shizuoka actually has an anthropomorphic football as a mascot. The west of the prefecture was already home to the company team of Yamaha Motor Corporation who played in the Japan Soccer League and who would later go on to form Júbilo Iwata, but it was believed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for another team for the football-hungry population. An earlier attempt {{had been made in}} the 1970s with the local club belonging to Nippon Light Metal Corp., which briefly competed in the JSL Division 2 under the name Hagoromo Club. With the advent of the professional league {{at the start of the}} 1990s, the concept of creating a team to both sign and represent the local footballing talent was fomented.|$|E

25|$|Tange {{organised}} {{the spaces}} of the three firms by function {{to allow them to}} share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for vertical expansion.|$|E
500|$|Dredd {{himself had}} few doubts of the outcome. In an {{interview}} {{he pointed out}} that although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for reform, the basic idea of the Judge System was still for the best: [...] "better the devil you know", as the interviewer summarised it.

500|$|To {{carry out}} the {{improvements}} more efficiently and cheaply, Green raised a Soldier Artificer Company – a predecessor of the Royal Engineers – of skilled labourers under military discipline. He also improved the garrison's state of preparation for a fresh siege. The quality of the guns was improved; by 1776 there were 98 pointing north plus two mortars and two howitzers. Another 300 were mounted on the Line Wall and the south front, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for a further 106. The guns were kept constantly loaded with several rounds positioned nearby in reserve, {{in case of a}} surprise attack.

500|$|Balzac mined his {{own life}} for details in the first parts of La Peau de Chagrin, and he likely modeled the protagonist Raphaël de Valentin on himself. Details recounted by Valentin of his impoverished living {{quarters}} are autobiographical allusions to Balzac's earliest days as an author: [...] "Nothing could be uglier than this garret, awaiting its scholar, with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty. The roofing fell in a steep slope, {{and the sky was}} visible through chinks in the tiles. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for a bed, a table, and a few chairs, and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand." [...] Although they allow for a degree of embellishment, biographers and critics agree that Balzac was drawing from his own experience.|$|E
500|$|It {{was clear}} to the {{cardinals}} that Barbarigo would not be elected pope {{by the end of}} April, and the conclave entered a period where it had no clear direction. The daily scrutinies would return no successful candidates, and the afternoon scrutinies would often simply repeat the deadlock that had occurred in the morning. Votes even went to non-cardinals {{for the first time in}} a conclave since 1503. There was no clear lead as to who might be elected pope, and at one point several cardinals started a fire in the living quarters by accidentally knocking over a lamp while playing cards. [...] While this caused some of the cells housing the cardinals to be unlivable, three cardinals had died by that point so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> available to relocate the cardinals who had been put out of their previous housing.|$|E
500|$|When Nea Salamina Famagusta was founded, Greece was {{entering}} {{a period of}} civil war between leftists and rightists. The situation in Greece affected Cyprus, both politically and socially; most athletes were also involved in politics. At this time, Famagusta had two sports clubs: the Evagoras Gymnastic Association, or GSE (...) and the Anorthosis Famagusta FC. The GSE had many talented leftist athletes on its rosters. At Anorthosis, many players were also leftists. Under {{the influence of the}} contemporary right-wing political climate, the GSE and Anorthosis began to restrict leftist athletes. Additionally, Anorthosis was hosting at their clubhouse the right-wing Cypriot National Party. In early 1947 a group from Famagusta (including leftists, members and non-members of GSE and Anorthosis) concluded <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for another sports club in the city. Due to the existing restrictions, they envisioned a club which would appeal to everyone in Famagusta regardless of political affiliation.|$|E
