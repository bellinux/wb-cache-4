25|$|While {{offering}} {{income tax}} deductions {{has been the}} preferred method of providing tax incentives, some commentators have expressed concern that these incentives provide disproportionate benefits to wealthier donors.

Additional tax favored approaches have been proposed for organ donation, including providing: tax credits {{to the families of}} deceased donors (seeking to encourage consent), refundable tax credits (similar to the earned income credit) to provide greater tax equity among potential donors, and charitable deductions for the donation of blood or organs.|$|E

A 30% tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC. Another <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> is accelerated depreciation. Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for [...] "green credits". The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines. Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs). These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices. In December 2013 U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and other Republican senators argued that the [...] "wind energy production tax credit {{should be allowed to}} expire at the end of 2013" [...] and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations.|$|E

Over the past 15 years, {{the real value of}} child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> approximately doubled reaching nearly $ 1, 900 per child in 2006. This paper examines the efficiency cost of providing child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits.</b> A representative agent model is used to show how the efficiency cost of providing child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> depends on labor supply and fertility elasticities. The model reveals that cross-price substitution effect for labor supply and children is of primary importance in calculating the efficiency cost. However, there are no estimates of this parameter in the literature. This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to estimate this parameter. The estimated cross-price substitution effect implies that children and time spent outside of employment are complements. This implies that the full cost of providing child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> is larger than the reported tax expenditure. fertility, income <b>tax,</b> child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits,</b> female labor supply...|$|R

For {{the part}} of the GEA in Manhattan south of 110th Street, the owner had to provide {{affordable}} housing in order to get any 421-a tax benefits. For such projects, a ten-year tax abatement could be obtained through building affordable units offsite, via a [...] "negotiable certificate" [...] from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. However, a 20-year <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> could only be obtained by building affordable units on-site. In the rest of the GEA, certificates meant a 15-year exemption and on-site affordable units meant a 25-year exemption. Outside of the GEA, negotiable certificates were prohibited. A 15-year abatement was always allowed for any construction project, with a 25-year abatement being permitted if affordable housing units were built in the apartment building.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 November 2007, Dion {{released}} a policy plan, that he {{compared to the}} United Kingdom's Labour Party under former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

He set up targets to reduce general poverty by 30 percent and child poverty by 50 percent as well as helping working families with work rewards as well as increasing the Canada Child <b>Tax</b> <b>benefit,</b> increasing guaranteed revenues for seniors. In an editorial in the National Post, economist Alex MacMillan notes that the poverty targets Dion has set are based on a Statistics Canada measure that the statistical agency has stated is not a poverty measure (LICO), and that by using what is in effect a relative income measure rather than an absolute poverty measure, Dion is essentially aiming to flatten the income distribution of Canadians. However, there is no official poverty rate for Canada that Dion could otherwise use, and some other political parties also quote LICO figures as poverty rates.|$|E

In contrast, middle-income parents receive substantially smaller <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with children. This U-shaped pattern of benefits by income, which we call the middle-class parent penalty,' not only raises issues of fairness; it also generates marginal tax rates and marriage penalties for moderate income families that are as high or higher than those facing more well-to-do taxpayers.
