500|$|After Crash Bandicoot defeats Doctor Neo Cortex and rescues {{his girlfriend}} Tawna, Cortex falls from his lair down towards the Earth, his maniacal bid for world {{domination}} thwarted. After his crash, Cortex awakens {{in a dark}} cavern filled with glowing crystals. Convinced that they hold tremendous power, Cortex takes one and returns to his laboratory to examine it. He discovers that the planets will soon align, creating a catastrophic solar flux that threatens to destroy Earth itself. Learning that the crystals are {{the only means of}} containing this force, Cortex enlists the aid of his old colleague Doctor N. Gin and they design a new, upgraded, crystal-powered [...] "Cortex Vortex" [...] to capture the stellar energy. Realizing they need 25 more crystals <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> Cortex devises a plot to manipulate Crash into retrieving the crystals for him.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 an {{alternative}} mechanism was devised by Nadine Abraham and Peter Palffy-Muhoray of Ohio, USA, that utilizes capillary action combined with evaporation to produce motion, {{but has no}} volatile working fluid. [...] Their paper [...] "A Dunking Bird of the Second Kind" [...] , was submitted to the American Journal of Physics, and published in June 2004. It describes a mechanism which, while similar to the original drinking bird, operates without a temperature difference. Instead it utilizes a combination of capillary action, gravitational potential difference and the evaporation of water <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

We propose schemes to (a) maximize the packet reception ratio (PRR) by cooperation and (b) minimize the average packet delay (APD) by cooperation amongst nodes. Our key result and insight from the testbed implementation is about total data transmitted by each relay. A greedy policy that relays more data under a good harvesting condition {{turns out to}} be a sub optimal policy. This is because, energy replenishment is a slow process. The optimal scheme offers a low APD and also improves PRR...|$|R

5000|$|In 1812, Charles Redheffer, in Philadelphia, {{claimed to}} have {{developed}} a [...] "generator" [...] that could power other machines. Upon investigation, it was deduced that the power was being supplied from another connected machine. Robert Fulton exposed Redheffer's schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a catgut belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{events of}} A.C.E. 3 are mainly {{centered}} on a device called the Baldora Drive, which was originally planned as a teleportation device for outer space travel in Earth A and {{the invasion of the}} space colonies in Earth B. Both sides abandoned the use of the Baldora Drive 18 years ago, but recently brought it back into service when they obtained the means to repair it. Through this device, a wormhole is created in space between the two Earths, which allows the protagonists to travel between them. However, as the wormhole expands due to the effect of the Baldora Charge (which is used <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device)</b> obtained from various sources of energy, the wormhole grows large enough to make the two earths collide with one another due to gravitational attraction, which will destroy all mankind on both Earths. In order to stop this, heroes from both sides must band together {{and find a way to}} stop the device before the wormhole fully expands.|$|E
5000|$|One device uses {{dissolved}} sulfur as the cathode, lithium metal as the anode and {{an organic}} solvent as the electrolyte.

5000|$|At Bli-Bli Station, Ty is {{introduced}} to a scientist named Julius, a koala who has invented a device that will find the Talismans. [...] Because Thunder Eggs are required <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> Ty must find the Thunder Eggs by visiting portals to other worlds. Maurie informs Ty that he must find another boomerang. From there, Ty makes {{his way through a}} billabong and finds his second boomerang with the help of Maurie, At a rainforest, he helps save his dingo girlfriend Shazza and helps Ranger Ken by clearing the bats out of a cave, and learns to swim from the lifeguard Rex and find a wrecked ship on a tropical island. When Julius finds the first talisman, Ty encounters Bull, a boar. He tames Bull by luring him into the rocks and rescues the first talisman. At Julius' laboratory, Ty learns that Julius has developed elemental boomerangs by diverting the excess energy from the Fire Thunder Eggs through his Hyper Techno Boomerang Maker.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{appliances}} (such {{as those}} included within the televisions, computer and related equipment categories above, representing 9% of the total), typically use an AC to DC converter <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> {{this is often}} capable of operation over the approximate range of 100 V to 250 V and at 50 Hz to 60 Hz. The other categories are typically AC applications and usually have much more restricted input ranges. A study by the Building Research Establishment in the UK states that [...] "The existing 230 V system is well suited {{to the future of}} electricity whether through design or Darwinian processes. Any current perceived weakness is generally a result of cost reduction and market forces rather than any fundamental technical difficulties. Questions as to whether there are alternatives to the existing 230 V AC system are often overshadowed by legacy issues, the future smart agenda and cost in all but specific situations. Where opportunities do exist they are often for specific parts of the overall load and often small parts in terms of total demand." ...|$|E
50|$|After doing a {{reconnaissance}} of the Sarafan`s {{position in}} Nosgoth Umah, one of Vorador lieutenants discovers {{the location of}} an amulet called the Nexus Stone before being captured, and sentenced to death. After being rescued by Kain, Umah informs Kain that the Nexus Stone is what the Sarafan Lord used to defeat him in their battle. Afterward Vorador tells Kain of a secret weapon that will wipe away all life in Nosgoth that is not Hylden. Kain is then told {{to seek out the}} Seer, a witch that lives on the outskirts of Meridian. After setting out to find the Seer, she informs him of a weapon created eons ago by an ancient race long banished from their realm of existence. Hylden were banished before completing the weapon known as The Device. The Seer explains to Kain that the glyph magic that is supplying Meridian with power is also being used <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>The</b> <b>Device.</b> She also told him to drink her blood to receive the dark gift of telekinesis. As they talked the Sarafan Lord had secretly tracked Kain to the Seer`s location and set fire to her house. Sacrificing her safety, the Seer then teleports Kain to the Eternal Prison. It is not known what happened to the Seer after her conversation with Kain.|$|E

5000|$|Marvel editor Mark Paniccia has {{described}} the Red Hulk as [...] "absolutely uninhibited, tactically intelligent", while writer Jeph Loeb states [...] "The Red Hulk {{is the kind of}} Hulk we haven't seen before—a thinking, calculating, brutal weapon-toting kind of Hulk." [...] To further distance the character away from the original: [...] "Everything the Green Hulk isn't, the Red Hulk is. Except, of course, for his powers which are identical. And he looks the same, except he's red. And he's the same size. But other than that, they're complete opposites." [...] The character has abilities almost identical to those of the current Hulk. The character can also emit heat at will from his eyes during non-enraged periods, and can augment power levels by absorbing various types of energy, such as gamma radiation (in one instance causing the Hulk to revert to alter ego Bruce Banner) and the Power Cosmic. When infected with Cable's techno-organic virus during the [...] "X-Sanction" [...] storyline, he was able to control this heat to burn the virus out of his system. Red Hulk was created through a combination of gamma radiation and cosmic rays. The satellites used to revert the Hulk to human form at the end of World War Hulk were used <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> used to turn Ross into the Red Hulk. Unlike the green Hulk, the Red Hulk does not revert to human form when rendered unconscious, and his blood is a fluorescent yellow instead of green, remaining that color even in human form. Unlike the green Hulk, who gets stronger as his rage increases, Red Hulk's body temperature rises with his anger. Though the heat is intense enough to melt desert sand into glass, it causes him to weaken when it becomes too intense, as his physiology lacks a cooling mechanism to deal with the excess heat. Red Hulk has also been shown to have a weakness to Negative Zone energy, which caused him burning pain and drained him when he attempted to absorb it.|$|E
5000|$|Up above, Skips, Pops, Muscle Man, and Eileen are {{assembling}} the phone signal device. Benson tells Mordecai and RIgby {{they were getting}} stuff dome while they were gone, and Eileen remarks that the device is almost done. Eileen says it should create some service, but then points out another issue: the Earth is getting farther away from them. Benson {{says that it is}} time to call home, so Skips flips the switch and the device starts to turn on. As it roars to life, a bar appears on Eileen's phone and she cheers. However, the bulb that helps <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> glows too strongly, then breaks, causing a chain reaction of the other items falling apart or breaking. Benson starts to yell again, saying that they will die, then it turns to a panic, yelling they are drifting in space with NO WAY to communicate with Earth, and suddenly blames Rigby for them getting stuck in space. Rigby points out Benson pressed the button as well, Benson says that Rigby's hand was on top of his, and Rigby insists he was going with the flow. Benson is annoyed by this statement, and shoves Rigby to show him how he [...] "goes with the flow", which leads to Rigby punching Benson in turn, and everyone else is shocked. When everyone else nears, Mordecai yanks Rigby back while Skips throws Benson away from him while Eileen, Pops, Muscle Man and Fives stare in shock or anger. Eileen screams that they are not being helpful. Mordecai then notices a weird star-like shape in the sky, and Benson wonders what it is. While ealking to it, Eileen predicts that it is a satellite. Skips looks out with binoculars and identifies the object as his old car phone, which Eileen points out that they can send a signal to Earth if they can get close enough to it. Mordecai and Rigby remember the space carts, but Benson says that he will drive for fear that he thinks they will mess it up.|$|E
