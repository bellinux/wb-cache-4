5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} <b>turntable</b> (often shortened to Xerxes) is {{a record}} player named after the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven <b>turntable</b> that has a solid plinth. Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference <b>turntable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The GCR {{constructed}} {{an engine}} shed {{at the site}} in 1897, but it was short lived. A locomotive servicing area, consisting of a <b>turntable</b> and coaling stage remained in use {{until the end of}} steam traction at the station in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{people used}} the <b>turntable</b> trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' {{because they were}} used to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were the {{ancestors}} of the cannon.|$|E
50|$|Direct-drive <b>turntables</b> are {{currently}} {{the most popular}} phonographs, due to their widespread use for turntablism in DJ culture. Panasonic's Technics series were the first direct-drive <b>turntables,</b> and remain the most popular series of <b>turntables.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until the 1970s, the idler-wheel {{drive was}} the most common on <b>turntables,</b> except for higher-end audiophile models. However, even some higher-end <b>turntables,</b> such as the Lenco, Garrard, EMT, and Dual <b>turntables,</b> used idler-wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|Later <b>turntables</b> were {{electrically}} operated. Many {{diesel locomotives}} in the UK have a cab {{at each end}} removing {{the need for the}} <b>turntables.</b> However, in Australia and America {{there are a number of}} single ended locomotives and <b>turntables</b> are still in use.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} lodges on Euston Road and statues {{now on the}} forecourt, few relics of the old station survive. The National Railway Museum's {{collection}} at York includes Edward Hodges Baily's statue of George Stephenson, both from the Great Hall; the entrance gates; and an 1846 <b>turntable</b> discovered during demolition.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero 2 {{was sold}} with various promotional items. Within Europe and select stores in North America, players that {{purchased}} {{the game in}} one of two bundle packages (either with one or two <b>turntable</b> controllers) received the predecessor DJ Hero free. Other North American stores offered carrying cases for the turntables, MP3 versions of selected mixes, or redemption codes for in-game customization options.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge <b>turntable</b> with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen <b>turntable</b> for a set period of time.|$|E

50|$|Classic EMT <b>turntables</b> are sought-after by audiophiles. The early, larger idler-wheel {{machines}} (927, 930) {{are still}} considered amongst the best <b>turntables</b> ever built.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turntables</b> were {{generally}} small - in 1900 the longest was 50 feet - {{enough to turn}} the later B12 Class 4-6-0 locomotive. By 1932, {{with the advent of}} bigger locomotives and the working of other companies' locomotives onto GE territory, <b>turntables</b> had grown, with the major sheds generally having 60- or 65-foot <b>turntables.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1989, Roksan {{introduced}} the Artaxerxes phono stage – a moving coil phono pre-amplifier designed to sit inside the <b>turntable.</b> Roksan also marketed a three-legged table {{dedicated to the}} deck. In 1987 Roksan launched the Shiraz moving coil phono cartridge. In 1989, Roksan launched the budget Radius record player, Tabriz arm and Corus moving magnet cartridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to using a <b>turntable,</b> players {{have the option}} to sing or rap to the mixes' lyrics, similar to vocal parts in current Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using a compatible microphone controller from most previous rhythm games. The game will score vocals based on the matching of pitch, beat and rhythm.|$|E
5|$|The Rega Planar 3, {{together}} with its successors, the P3 and RP3, {{is a well-known}} budget audiophile <b>turntable</b> by British hi-fi manufacturer, Rega Research available since 1977. It was a belt-drive deck that broke from convention, by employing a solid plinth {{in lieu of the}} compliantly-suspended chassis or sub-chassis used in many quality turntables since the early 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Columbia and RCA's {{competition}} {{extended to}} equipment. Some <b>turntables</b> included spindle size adapters, but other <b>turntables</b> required triskelion snap-in inserts {{like this one}} to adapt RCA's larger 45 rpm spindle size to the smaller spindle size available on nearly all <b>turntables.</b> Shown is one popular design in use for many years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{records were}} played on <b>turntables,</b> {{but since the}} timing - the clock {{synchronization}} - between the two SIGSALY terminals had to be precise, the <b>turntables</b> {{were by no means}} just ordinary record-players. The rotation rate of the <b>turntables</b> was carefully controlled, and the records were started at highly specific times, based on precision time-of-day clock standards. Since each record only provided 12 minutes of key, each SIGSALY had two <b>turntables,</b> with a second record [...] "queued up" [...] while the first was [...] "playing".|$|R

5|$|A funk {{and dance}} album, Rhythm Killers has a dense sound that {{incorporates}} contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs {{are characterized by}} electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by <b>turntable</b> scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's densely layered production.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a <b>turntable.</b> The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small <b>turntable</b> meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
50|$|USB <b>turntables</b> have a {{built-in}} audio interface, which transfers the sound {{directly to the}} connected computer. Some USB <b>turntables</b> transfer the audio without equalization, but are sold with software that allows the EQ of the transferred audio file to be adjusted. There are also many <b>turntables</b> on the market designed to be plugged into a computer via a USB port for needle dropping purposes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Two <b>turntables</b> and a microphone" [...] is {{the basic}} concept of a DJ's equipment. This phrase {{describes}} <b>turntables</b> (phonographs) and a microphone connected to a mixer. The DJ uses the mixer's crossfader to fade between two songs playing on the <b>turntables.</b> Fading often includes beatmatching. Live hip hop music also often has an MC rapping into the microphone. In nightclubs the microphone is usually used only for announcements.|$|R
5000|$|Primitive phonographs {{which used}} idler wheels {{sometimes}} had very high wow and flutter, but high fidelity belt drive <b>turntables</b> were typically less than 0.2% by the 1970s, {{and the best}} direct drive <b>turntables</b> reached less than 0.05%.|$|R
5|$|DJ Hero is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special game controller that includes a <b>turntable</b> surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the <b>turntable</b> controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions scroll down on screen towards the player in time with the music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each mix) to unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to Expert), with higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero was {{announced}} by Activision in May 2009. Prior to the announcement, {{the company had}} purchased FreeStyleGames, a small developer of music games, to help produce localized downloadable content for Guitar Hero games and a then-unannounced music game, later revealed to be DJ Hero. DJ Hero uses a special turntable-based controller for players to perform with on various song mixes in the game. The game also incorporates {{the use of a}} Guitar Hero controller on ten specially arranged tracks; Bright has suggested that future Guitar Hero games after Guitar Hero 5 may include the use of the <b>turntable</b> control.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} <b>turntable</b> controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2010s Vestax {{focused on}} {{high-tech}} musical electronics, creating signal processors, DJ Mixers, professional <b>turntables</b> and Compact Disc players. The company also reduced its range of <b>turntables,</b> but kept the PDX-2000mk2/2300mk2 for mainstream DJ use, and the PDX-2000mk2pro/PDX-2300pro {{with a new}} tonearm suspension system for increased skip resistance. In conjunction with DJ Qbert they have also released the QFO and QFO LE models. These <b>turntables</b> have built-in mixers, and a portable turntable/mixer ...|$|R

5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a <b>turntable</b> and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a <b>turntable,</b> which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a <b>turntable,</b> predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E

50|$|In Sri Lanka, most <b>turntables</b> {{which were}} used in the steam area have been abandoned. Most were {{situated}} at the major railway yards like Kandy, Galle, Nanu Oya, Anuradhapura, Maho, Galoya, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Polgahawela Jnc, Badulla, Puttulam, and Bandarawela and depots in Dematagoda 2no. and Maradana. All <b>turntables</b> in Sri Lanka Railways were operated manually. They were used to turn some rolling stock and non-dual cab locomotives. Most <b>turntables</b> were later scrapped, though some have been preserved in museums.|$|R
