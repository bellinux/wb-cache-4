The concert hall {{is the home of}} St. Michel Strings chamber orchestra, and also provides the main venue for the annual Mikkeli International Music Festival, which attracts musicians and audiences from across Europe. For example, Mariinsky Opera led by Valery Gergiev performs there regularly.|$|E
5|$|The UX52VS has {{the option}} of Intel's {{ultra-low}} voltage i5 or i7 mobile processors, up to 10GB of RAM and an optical disc drive. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> first for the Zenbook product series.

5|$|Chavrusa-style {{learning}} is particularly suited to Talmud study, as <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, {{a student of}} Talmud {{must be able to}} analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others. The chavrusa relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Cole and Davie {{developed}} a two-player game {{based on the}} Euclidean algorithm, called The Game of Euclid, which has an optimal strategy. The players begin with two piles of a and b stones. The players take turns removing m multiples of the smaller pile from the larger. Thus, if the two piles consist of x and y stones, where x is larger than y, the next player can reduce the larger pile from x stones to x − my stones, as long as <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nonnegative integer. The winner is {{the first player to}} reduce one pile to zero stones.|$|E
5|$|Less {{relevant}} is {{the other}} 6th-century source, Jordanes' Romana. Of Gothic ancestry, Jordanes served as a notarius for a Byzantine Master of the Soldiers before entering {{into the ranks of}} the Catholic clergy and writing his two surviving books, the Romana and the Getica. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> summary of Gothic history, while the lesser known Romana is an abridged account of Roman history written in 551 or 552. According to James O'Donnell, the two works share a pessimistic view of human life in which all secular accomplishments are insignificant compared to religious goals. Jordanes does not explicitly mention Thurisind in the Romana, but speaks of the third Lombard–Gepid War, in which Thurisind participated, in the last passages of the work.|$|E

5|$|Mallanarya of Gubbi, a poet bilingual in Kannada and Sanskrit, {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of King Krishnadeva Raya. His important writings in Kannada in the shatpadi metre are the Bhava Chintaratna (also called Satyendra Chole Kathe, 1513) and the Virasaivamrita Purana (1530). The former {{was based on}} a 7th-century Tamil work and about a Chola King {{in the context of the}} Shaiva faith; <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> writing of encyclopedic proportions that goes beyond philosophical content, describing the various forms (or sports, called lila) of god Shiva and the lives of famous Shaiva saints.|$|E
5|$|The IK-2 and IK-14 penal {{colonies in}} Yavas, Zubovo-Polyansky District, Mordovia, {{are the most}} common {{destinations}} for women prisoners sentenced in Moscow. It is the former location of the Dubravlag labor camp complex of the Gulag system. Tolokonnikova was incarcerated in IK-14, whereas Alyokhina was sent to IK-32 in Perm. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> colony for first-time offenders, which houses a sewing factory, and an experimental vocational program to re-train women prisoners to become digital cartoon animators. Conditions in IK-32 are relatively favorable, and neither prisoners nor human rights monitors have filed complaints about its conditions. Meanwhile, IK-14 has a harder reputation.|$|E
5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates {{can be found in the}} modern Tajik language, although <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Western Iranian language.|$|E

5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> semiconductor.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form {{available}} in commercial nurseries is unimproved Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. It prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts, and tolerates fairly heavy pruning. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 5 to 6 weeks to germinate. Flowering begins at around four to six years from seed. The other subspecies are less well known in cultivation, but are obtainable. Cultivation is presumably similar to B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, except that B.integrifolia subsp. monticola may be assumed frost-tolerant. Dwarf forms of B.integrifolia are sometimes sold, and a registered prostrate cultivar, Banksia 'Roller Coaster', is available. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> vigorous ground-hugging plant that can spread to 4 or 5 metres across yet remains only 50 centimetres high.|$|E
5|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa {{observed}} in a sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity Index value ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic richness and evenness of individuals. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96.|$|E

5|$|Lyndsay {{produced}} an interlude at Linlithgow Palace {{for the king}} and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.|$|E
5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E
