40|$|Domestic {{violence}} and its prevention My Master's degree thesis is titled "Domestic {{violence and}} its prevention". The purpose of my thesis {{is to present}} <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> as an important phenomenon which our society contends with. <b>The</b> domestic <b>violence</b> represents a problem which has an essential influence on its victims, it causes substantial effects on their private live, family relationships and also their health. The thesis is composed of eleven chapters, each of them is subdivided into several subchapters. Opening chapters deal with the criminological aspects of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> subsequent chapters concern the legal matters regarding <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> Final chapters attend to the prevention of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and analyze <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was to map possibilities of a co-operation among the intervention centre and other entities interested in helping to people threatened by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> current status {{was taken from the}} professional literature. There is described an issue of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> types and forms of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> its characteristics and dynamics, causes, consequences, legal framework of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> its actors, entities helping to people threatened by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and an interdisciplinary co-operation. The qualitative research was used in the thesis. A tool for the data collection was a semi-standardized interview. Questions were based on theme ranges concerning the examined issue. The research sample consisted of 13 workers of the entities helping to people at risk of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> in <b>the</b> Highland (Vysočina) region. The research showed that <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> is a very wide-spread and still underestimated issue. At the same time it is seen a considerable progress {{in the area of the}} help to people at risk by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> Further <b>the</b> research showed that workers do not exactly know services provided by the Intervention Centre of the Highland (Vysočina) region. Thanks to this fact there can occur a disinformation of people threatened by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> staff can determine the most often demanded help from the side of the potential service users. They can also recognize that not always it is about the help the intervention centre is able to provide. The research does not confirm that the personnel generally would be influenced by prejudices at their work with people at risk by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> But they were certainly also in their professional life influenced by a personal experience with <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> that acquired in their neighbourhood. The research raised a possibility of a co-operation among the intervention centre and other entities, namely organizing case conferences. This thesis can be used in practice for an acquisition or addition of professional experience related to the issue of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and available provided services...|$|R
