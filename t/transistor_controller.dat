40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>transistor</b> <b>controller</b> {{construction}} for low-power electric drives using the original principle of control is presented. The proposed principle of regulation {{is close to}} the relay or oscillatory type actuator, but differs from it by the higher degree of invariance to changes in torque downloads on drive motor shaft. The feature of the development is that the drive controller fulfills not just a change in the value on the torque motor shaft or jobs - it fulfills almost the rate of disturbances change. It is shown that new development takes into account the drive features of the basic units of mechanized and automated equipment for arc welding, but can be used in other industrial facilities. Manufacture and testing facilities are performed in real samples regulators, which characteristics in a simple but efficient construction meets all requirements of systems that are installed in the welding equipment. It is proposed to expand the use of electric considered at its implementation in integrated circuit desig...|$|E

The {{bottom line is}} that the only way to insure a mine has been found and removed is to step on it. As this is an upsetting proposition for biological organisms like animals or children, this paper details a proposed non-biological method that may have validity following additional research into the new science of Biomorphic Machines. A Robobiologist at LANL has invented and developed a variety of {open_quotes}living{close_quotes} robots that are solar powered, legged, autonomous, adaptive to massive damage and terrain, and very inexpensive. This technology, called Nervous Net (Nv) design, allows for the creation of capable walking mechanisms (known as {open_quotes}Biomorphic Robots{close_quotes}) which rather than run on a {open_quotes}work{close_quotes} ethic, use {open_quotes}survivalist{close_quotes} design principles. These principles allow Nv based machines to continue doing work even after multiple limbs have been removed or damaged, and to dynamically negotiate complex terrains as an emergent property of their operation.

40|$|In the PLS (Pohang Light Source), {{more than}} 200 units of uni-polar and bi-polar high {{precision}} magnet power supplies (MPSs) have been operated since 1994. The uni-polar MPSs are 12 -step SCR rectifier type, and the bi-polar MPSs are H-bridge type choppers that adopt IGBTs. Also, 144 units of <b>transistor</b> linear-type shunt <b>controllers</b> for the BBA (Beam-Based Alignment) application were added in 1997. The storage ring {{operation of the}} PLS starts with injection of 2 -GeV beam from the PLS linac, and the beam energy is ramped to 2. 5 GeV for normal operation by increasing operation currents of MPS and output powers of RF stations. In this paper, we discuss technical details and performance-test results of the PLS high precision MPSs, and introduce our upgrade plan of the MPSs Transistor-type linear shunt controllers are connected in parallel with quadrupole power supplies for the orbit correction of stored beam.

40|$|The current {{variety and}} {{dispersion}} of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) is a daunting technological problem for current sensory and extraction techniques. The {{bottom line is}} that the only way to insure a live UXO has been found and removed is to step on it. As this is an upsetting proposition for biological organisms like animals, farmers, or Yuma field personnel, this paper details a non-biological approach to developing inexpensive, automatic machines that will find, tag, and may eventually remove UXO from a variety of terrains by several proposed methods. The Yuma proving grounds (Arizona) has been pelted with bombs, mines, missiles, and shells since the 1940 s. The idea of automatic machines that can clean up after such testing is an old one but as yet unrealized because of the daunting cost, power and complexity requirements of capable robot mechanisms. A researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory has invented and developed a new variety of living robots that are solar powered, legged, autonomous, adaptive to massive damage, and very inexpensive. This technology, called Nervous Networks (Nv), allows for the creation of capable walking mechanisms (known as Biomorphic robots, or Biomechs for short) that rather than work from task principles use instead a survival-based design philosophy. This allows Nv based machines to continue doing work even after multiple limbs and sensors have been removed or damaged, and to dynamically negotiate complex terrains as an emergent property of their operation (fighting to proceed, as it were). They are not programmed, and indeed, the twelve <b>transistor</b> Nv <b>controller</b> keeps their electronic cost well below that of most pocket radios. It is suspected that advanced forms of these machines in huge numbers may be an interesting, capable solution to the problem of general and specific UXO identification, tagging, and removal...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{power demands}} and cost motivates us to explore low power {{solutions}} in electronics. In nanometer Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) processes with low threshold voltages and thin gate oxides, subthreshold leakage power dominates total {{power of a}} circuit. As technology scales, Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) emerged as a major limiting reliability mechanism. It causes a threshold voltage shift which, over time, results in circuit performance degradation. Hence, leakage power and NBTI degradation are two key challenges in deep sub micron regime. In this dissertation, interval arithmetic based interval propagation technique is introduced as an effective leakage optimization technique in high level circuits with little overhead. The concept of self similarity from fractal theory is adopted {{for the first time}} in VLSI research to handle large design space. Though there are some leakage and NBTI co-optimization techniques in literature, our vector cycling approach combined with a back tracking algorithm have achieved better results for ISCAS 85 benchmarks. We did not find any previous research works on NBTI optimization of finite state machines (FSMs). The optimization techniques of NBTI optimization in FSMs is introduced in this dissertation as well and substantial NBTI optimization is reported. Input vector control has been shown to be an effective technique to minimize subthreshold leakage. Applying appropriate minimum leakage vector (MLV) to each register transfer level (RTL) module instance results in a low leakage state with significant area overhead. For each module, via Monte Carlo simulation, we identify a set of MLV intervals such that maximum leakage is within (say) 10 % of the lowest leakage points. As the module bit width increases, exhaustive simulation to find the low leakage vector is not feasible. Further, we need to search the entire input space uniformly to obtain as many low leakage intervals as possible. Based on empirical observations, we observed self similarity in the leakage distribution of adder/multiplier modules when input space is partitioned into smaller cells. This property enables uniform search of low leakage vectors in the entire input space. Also, the time taken for characterization increases linearly with the module size. Hence, this technique is scalable to higher bit width modules with acceptable characterization time. We can reduce area overhead (in some cases to 0) by choosing Primary Input (PI) MLVs such that resultant inputs to internal nodes are also MLVs. Otherwise, control points can be inserted. Based on interval arithmetic, given a DFG, we propose a heuristic with several variations for PI MLV identification with minimal control points. Experimental results for DSP filters simulated in 16 nm technology demonstrated leakage savings of 93. 8 % with no area overhead, compared to existing work. Input vector control can also be adopted to reduce NBTI degradation as well as leakage in CMOS circuits. In the prior work, it is shown that minimum leakage vector of a circuit is not necessarily NBTI friendly. In order to achieve NBTI and leakage co-optimization, we propose an input vector cycling technique which applies different sub-optimal low leakage vectors to primary inputs at regular intervals. A co-optimal input vector for a given circuit is obtained by using simulated annealing (SA) technique. For a given input vector, a set of critical path PMOS transistors are under stress. A second input vector is obtained using a back tracking algorithm such that most of the critical path PMOS transistors are put in recovery mode. When a co-optimized input vector is assigned to primary input, critical path nodes under stress with high delay contribution are set to recovery. Logic 1 is back propagated from the nodes to the primary inputs to obtain the second input vector. These two vectors are alternated at regular time intervals. The total stress is evenly distributed among transistor sets of two vectors, as the intersection of the two sets is minimized. Hence, the overall stress on critical path transistors is alleviated, thereby reducing the NBTI delay degradation. For ISCAS 85 benchmarks, an average of 5. 3 % improvement is achieved in performance degradation at 3. 3 % leakage overhead with NBTI-leakage co-optimization with a back tracking algorithm compared to solely using co-optimization. A 10. 5 % average NBTI improvement is obtained when compared to circuit with minimum leakage input vector for 18 % average leakage overhead. Also, an average NBTI improvement of 2. 13 % is obtained with 6. 77 % leakage improvement when compared to circuit with minimum NBTI vector. Vector cycling is shown to be more effective in mitigating NBTI over input vector control. Several works in the literature have proposed optimal state encoding techniques for delay, leakage, and dynamic power optimization. In this work, we propose, for the first time, NBTI optimization based on state code optimization. We propose a SA based state code assignment algorithm, resulting in minimization of NBTI degradation in the synthesized circuit. A PMOS transistor when switched ON for a long period of time, will lead to delay degradation due to NBTI. Therefore, in combinational circuits, an NBTI friendly input vector that stresses the least number of PMOS transistors on the critical path can be applied. For sequential circuits, the state code can significantly influence the ON/OFF mode of PMOS <b>transistors</b> in the <b>controller</b> implementation. Therefore, we propose to focus on state encoding. As the problem is computational intractable, we will focus on encoding states with high state probability. The following SA moves are employed: (a) code swap; and (b) code modification by flipping bits. Experiments with LGSYNTH 93 benchmarks resulted in 18. 6 % improvement in NBTI degradation on average with area and power improvements of 5. 5 % and 4. 6 % respectively...|$|R
