I {{found it hard to}} make anything of <b>that.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often {{talked with}} Sasuke's Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their {{characters}}. When the two characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre of the Uchiha clan {{hard to believe}} and started to read the Naruto manga {{in order to see}} if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors noted <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> Itachi served as a good old brother to Sasuke. English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how many times he revisited the series.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Marines Division were {{earmarked}} for Hardboiled, trained in mountain warfare, and given cold weather equipment. Realistic invasion plans were drawn up and Norwegian currency was stockpiled. These preparations met with considerable {{resistance from the}} armed forces, who considered the operation to {{be a waste of}} effort. The need for soldiers in real operations and training meant <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> a lot of the preparation never occurred.|$|E

5|$|While Fossett had financed five {{previous}} tries himself, {{his successful}} record-setting flight {{was sponsored by}} Bud Light. In the end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights. He bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight. Along with sponsorship, that payout meant <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> Fossett {{did not have to}} spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.|$|E
5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes {{like the}} one in which Sasuke admits his crimes and agrees to go to prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, as well as his decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles {{first went}} to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime {{opportunity}} to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles's complicity in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. It {{should be noted that}} both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.|$|E

5|$|In Scandinavia, Haakon {{regularly}} {{met with}} neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven {{from the late}} 1240s through the 1250s. Using grand fleets as envoys, Haakon's fleet at most reportedly counted over 300 ships. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with the Swedes, as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. Haakon {{made a deal with}} Swedish leader Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by the Swedes (see Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for the looting of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. He was however forced to renounce his claims in 1257 after a peace agreement was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son Magnus and Ingeborg, daughter of former Danish king Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had also reconciled with the Swedes when he had his son Haakon the Young marry a daughter of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar Union), <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> had dire consequences for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon's aggressive policies.|$|E

25|$|Johns' {{breakthrough}} move, {{which was}} to inform much later work by others, was to appropriate popular iconography for painting, thus allowing a set of familiar associations to answer the need for subject. Though the abstract expressionists disdained subject matter, {{it could be argued}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> they had simply changed subjects. Johns neutralized the subject, so that something like a pure painted surface could declare itself. For twenty years after Johns painted Flag, the surface could suffice – for example, in Andy Warhol's silkscreens, or in Robert Irwin's illuminated ambient works.|$|E

25|$|During Teti's reign, high {{officials}} {{were beginning to}} build funerary monuments that rivaled that of the Pharaoh.

25|$|According to R. J. Rummel, {{genocide}} has 3 different meanings. The {{ordinary meaning}} is murder by government of people {{due to their}} national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). This also includes non-killings <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide {{is similar to the}} ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term democide for the third meaning.|$|E

Statistics also indicated that, during {{the transition from the}} 1965 PMR (with 8% of the total population) to the 1988 PCR, the {{membership of}} workers had grown from 44 to 55%, while that of peasants had dropped from 34 to 15%. In the end, these records contrasted the fact that the PCR had become completely subservient to its leader and no longer had any form of autonomous activity, while membership became a basic requirement in numerous social contexts, leading to purely formal allegiances and political clientelism.|$|E
