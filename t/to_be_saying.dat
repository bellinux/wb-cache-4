5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E

500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy Remixed was generally negative. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters {{explained that the}} remixers' efforts ultimately make Bloc Party's work [...] "less engaging, less meaningful". Ben Patashnik of NME stated that the album is largely monotonous and includes too many pedestrian experiments in dance music. Drowned in Sound's Chris Power indicated that [...] "in putting their names to the album Bloc Party seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> they either don't care about what they ask fans to spend their money on or they don't know much about electronic music".|$|E
500|$|Historians have {{expressed}} criticism for Brezhnev and his rule. The scholarly literature dealing {{with him is}} scarce and, {{with the exception of}} the period immediately after his death, overwhelmingly negative. Very little has been written about Brezhnev in English, and even Russian literature. According to Mark Sandle and Edwin Bacon, the authors behind Brezhnev Reconsidered, Brezhnev had attracted little attention from the media due to a consensus of his rule that was formed shortly after his death; literally that his rule was one primarily of stagnation. When Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, initiated perestroika he blamed the degradation of the Soviet economic and political system on Brezhnev, and called his rule the [...] "Era of Stagnation". Gorbachev claimed that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line", although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now".|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief {{appearance}} of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' politically incorrect moments are funny and well-observed, this episode seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time." [...] Despite the negative review from I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "The Trouble with Trillions" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] {{and it has been}} described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as [...] "criminally underrated".|$|E

500|$|Brezhnev {{presided over}} the Soviet Union for longer than any other person except Joseph Stalin. He is often criticised for the {{prolonged}} Era of Stagnation, in which fundamental economic problems were ignored and the Soviet political system was allowed to decline. During Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader {{there was an increase}} in criticism of the Brezhnev years, such as claims that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line". The Gorbachevian discourse blamed Brezhnev for failing to modernise the country and to change with the times, although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now." [...] The intervention in Afghanistan, {{which was one of the}} major decisions of his career, also significantly undermined both the international standing and the internal strength of the Soviet Union. In Brezhnev's defence, it can be said that the Soviet Union reached unprecedented and never-repeated levels of power, prestige, and internal calm under his rule.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the film}} was released, rumors and {{allegations}} began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim, in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, said that the Church of Scientology [...] "has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth film master to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience {{and to get the}} audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices". Other critics said that the film [...] "is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence", and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits. Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as [...] "silly nonsense", the Church of Scientology denounced them as [...] "hogwash" [...] and the media reacted with skepticism; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it, [...] "the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10minutes into this 121-minute film and it seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow". When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens, church spokesman Aron Mason stated, [...] "That's a pretty crude parallel… You'd have to make some serious leaps of logic to make that comparison." [...] John Travolta also stated that {{the film was}} not inspired by Scientology tenets.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

[...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself.""

2500|$|Shindo {{continued}} his exploration {{of human sexuality}} with Akuto in 1965 and Lost Sex in 1966. In Lost Sex, a middle aged man who has become temporarily impotent after the Hiroshima bombing in 1945, once again loses his virility due to nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll. In the end, he is cured by his housekeeper. Impotence was again the theme of Shindo's next film, Libido, released in 1967. Gender politics and strong female characters played a strong role {{in both of these}} films. Tadao Sato said [...] "By contrasting the comical weakness of the male with the unbridled strength of the female, Shindo seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> in the 1960s that women had wrought their revenge. This could have been a reflection of postwar society, since it is commonly said in Japan women have become stronger because men have lost all confidence in their masculinity due to Japan's defeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{followed}} this {{up with the}} sequel to The Born Losers, Billy Jack, in 1971. American International Pictures initially agreed to distribute the picture but after viewing it the studio refused to release the film unless many of the political references – as well as frontal nudity – were cut. This led the Laughlins to withhold the sound reels of the movie, which in effect made it a silent film. Eventually, Laughlin made a distribution deal with Warner Bros. but he disapproved of the studio's marketing of the film, sued Warners, and re-released the picture himself. The movie's re-release was successful but controversial. Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, wrote, [...] "Billy Jack seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that a gun {{is better than a}} constitution in the enforcement of justice. Is democracy totally obsolete, then? Is our only hope that the good fascists defeat the bad fascists?" ...|$|E

(The same term was applied 30 years earlier to Daniel O'Connell.) He strove to retain Fenian support but insisted when asked by a reporter that he personally could not join a secret society.

But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E
