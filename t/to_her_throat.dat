5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} lunatic beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's stomach <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E

Price accused Eugene Williams of holding the knife <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and said {{that all of the}} other teenagers had knives. Under cross examination she gave more detail, adding that someone held a knife to the white teenager, Gilley, during the rapes.|$|E
500|$|Suspicious of the {{identity}} of the unknown woman based on the carpoolers' general description, Walter Jones called Sharon Kinne and asked if she had seen or spoken to his wife. Kinne allowed that she had, indeed, seen Patricia that day; she had met her to tell her about Walter's affair. According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where she dropped her off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford. [...] Based on Kinne's admission over the phone, Walter Jones met with her late Friday evening and insisted she give him more details about where his wife was; he later admitted to {{going so far as to}} hold a key <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> threateningly. Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence. According to Boldizs, he had been the one to suggest searching the area in which they encountered the body; it was a spot to which they had often gone on dates before.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the voice}} problem, Loveless had booked an autumn 1992 tour. Additionally, {{she had been}} invited to appear on a CBS {{television}} special Women In Country. [...] The day before leaving on the tour, Loveless asked her manager to accompany her <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> doctor's office. In the office, her doctor compared her 1990 results versus what he saw during the exam. Her vocal cords had developed an enlarged blood vessel that looked like a varicose vein. The juxtaposition was dramatic, and furthermore, if not treated, it could end her career and there was no guarantee that surgery could correct the problem.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the later}} Whitechapel murder investigation, Phillips {{performed}} the post-mortem examination of Alice McKenzie (nicknamed [...] "Clay Pipe" [...] Alice and {{who used the}} alias Alice Bryant), who was killed on 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley in Whitechapel. At the coroner's inquest on 22 July 1889, Phillips stated that the injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> had been caused by someone who [...] "knew {{the position of the}} vessels, at any rate where to cut with reference to causing speedy death." [...] She had two jagged wounds in the left side of her neck. Phillips also found five superficial marks {{on the left side of}} McKenzie's abdomen, which had been made, he thought, by the pressure of a right thumb and fingers prior to mutilating her body with a knife that was held in the murderer's left hand.|$|E

According to an annual report for 1967 and a press release of the same year, he was also named as a suspect {{in a case of}} attempted rape of a 21-year-old woman, and [...] known for indecent exposure. Fritzl was arrested and served 12 months of an 18-month prison sentence. In accordance with Austrian law, his criminal record was expunged after 15 years. As a result, more than 25 years later, when he applied for the adoption of one child and foster care for two others, of children to whom his daughter Elisabeth had given birth, the local social service authorities did not discover his criminal history.|$|E
