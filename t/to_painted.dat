5|$|After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or {{the figure of the}} judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century statuary were preferred <b>to</b> <b>painted</b> portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E

When he died, his nephew Agiati became a calendar keeper, followed in turn by Agiati's son, Silver Horn (1860–1940), one of the most prolific of all Kiowa artists.|$|E

25|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. One route assigned at this time was NY4, a highway extending from the Pennsylvania state line in Lindley to downtown Rochester. NY4 roughly followed the modern alignment of US15 from Pennsylvania to Presho, Indian Hill Road from Presho to Erwin, NY417 from Erwin to Gang Mills, and Hamilton Street from Gang Mills <b>to</b> <b>Painted</b> Post. From Painted Post northward, NY4 was routed along modern NY415 to Wayland, from where it continued to Rochester on what is now NY15. At the state line, NY4 connected to Pennsylvania Route4 (PA4). In 1927, US4 was first signed in New York. As a result, NY4 was renumbered to NY2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, US15 was {{truncated}} southward <b>to</b> <b>Painted</b> Post and {{the portion}} of its former routing north of Painted Post was redesignated as NY15. Around the same time, NY17 was realigned between Olean and Corning to use the Southern Tier Expressway instead of modern NY417. The portion of the Genesee Expressway (I-390) from Avoca to Wayland opened to traffic in the mid-1970s. Although signage for NY15 existed on NY17 and I-390, no such overlap existed in reality as the southern terminus of NY15 was defined as I-390 in Wayland by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as early as 1977. In 2009, NYSDOT elected to remove the NY15 signage along the Southern Tier Expressway and I-390, effectively moving the signed terminus to I-390 in Wayland as well.|$|E
