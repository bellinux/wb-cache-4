Agora, porém, pensa que a questão está resolvida com o emprego apropriado da Terramicina. Antes dêsse antibiótico aparecer, aconselhára a Aureomycina e a Cloromicetina. Prefere, porém, agora a Terramycina, via oral e sub-cutânea ou intra muscular. Diz o autor que com ou sem terapêutica, as formas graves do Tifo exantemático neotrópico no Brasil deixavam escapar 16 a 18 % dos doentes. Foi por isso que agora, reunindo cerca de 34 casos das formas graves da doença, resolveu {{publicar}} o quadro que se segue. Nele vemos que dos doentes tratados com a Aureomicina, morreram 31, 25 % e os tratados com Terramicina, apenas 6, 6 %. Deve assinalar que o doente tratado com Terramicina que faleceu, esteve apenas no Hospital Cícero Ferreira, 7 horas antes da morte. Descreve 4 observações clínicas da doença. The author states that, {{for about}} 18 years, he has attempted the therapeutica of Neotropic Exanthematic typhus {{in many years}} with no appreciable result. Now, however, he thinks the question is solved by {{the proper use of}} <b>Terramycine.</b> Before this antibiotic appeared he advised Aureomy of <b>Terramycine.</b> Before this antibiotic appeared he advised Aureomycine and Chloromicetine. He prefers, however, <b>Terramycine,</b> via the mouth, sub cutaneous or intra-muscular. The author says that with or without therapeutics 16 to 18 per cent of the serious cases of Neotropic Exanthematic Typhus in Brazil, recovered. For tis reason, bringing together about 34 cases of the serious forms of the disease, he resolved to publish the following table. Here we see that of the patients treated with Aureomycine, 31, 25 % died and of those treated with Teramycine, only 6, 6 %. It whould be noted that the <b>Terramycine</b> patient was in the Hospital Cícero Ferreira, only seven hours before he died. The author gives four clinical reports of the disease...|$|E

The first positive data and the first observation were made in S. Paulo by Dr. Helvecio Brandão and there communicated to the S. Paulo Medical Association in 1951 and 1954. The first part was published in 1953; the second part is yet unpublished. The author of the present work cured his patient with <b>Terramycine.</b> He thinks that greater research should be made amongst the workpeople who {{have to do with}} cattle in the pastures and slaughterhouses in order to verify the extent of the disease amongst us.

The effects of tilmicosin administration in the feed at 400 mg/kg and an injection therapy of clinically diseased pigs with long-acting oxytetracycline (<b>Terramycine</b> (R) LA) at 20 mg/kg body-weight were compared. Both groups, totalling 147 pigs, were compared during a medication period of 15 days and a post-medication period of 11 days by means of different clinical and performance parameters. During the medication period, the tilmicosin group showed a significant advantage with respect to the number of new disease cases (P 0. 05) with respect to the clinical parameters. During the overall study period (26 days), the average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio were both significantly (P < 0. 01) better in pigs from the tilmicosin group compared with pigs from the oxytetracycline group. This study demonstrated that in-feed medication of tilmicosin at a dosage of 400 mg/kg is efficacious for the treatment of a clinical respiratory disease outbreak of A. pleuropneumoniae infection in growing-finishing pigs. Compared with oxytetracycline injection of clinically diseased pigs, the tilmicosin treatment is particularly, beneficial in the prevention of new disease cases while increasing or maintaining the performance the pigs...|$|E
