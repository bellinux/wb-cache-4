25|$|How <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and sample solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> into the top layer of matrix as <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> in the matrix. If <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be {{deposited on}} the surface of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe to allow the matrix to condense around <b>the</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|E
