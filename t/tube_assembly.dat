2500|$|The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager {{designed}} for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument {{is equipped with}} a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic CCD imager with a [...] aperture giving a resolution of 5μrad (~1arcsec). The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation, and isolation {{from the rest of the}} structure. The Ritchey–Chretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide, to boost stiffness, reduce weight, and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite light shield, and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is , with the optical <b>tube</b> <b>assembly</b> (OTA) weighing about , for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time (now surpassed by Herschel). For viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel LORRI images are converted to 8-bit per pixel JPEG images. These public images do not contain the full dynamic range of brightness information available from the raw LORRI images files.|$|E

5000|$|The {{focal plane}} {{is at an}} {{asymmetrical}} point {{and at the top}} of the optical <b>tube</b> <b>assembly.</b> For visual observing, most notably on equatorial telescope mounts, tube orientation can put the eyepiece in a very poor viewing position, and larger telescopes require ladders or support structures to access it.

For research telescopes, counterbalancing very heavy instruments mounted at this focus has to be taken into consideration.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Dr. Joseph Dennison Fox, Professor of Astronomy and History, {{completed}} his {{tenure at the}} University of Puerto Rico, and with his wife Sylvia, retired to North Miami. He brought with him an optical <b>tube</b> <b>assembly</b> for a 6-inch f/15 refractor. This telescope, in its updated and restored state, now resides in the Fox Observatory, {{on the grounds of}} Markham Park. The lens and original <b>tube</b> <b>assembly</b> were built by Chester Brandon, renowned as a designer of eyepieces and objective lenses. (The lens was ground from special blanks made by Dow-Corning. The uniqueness of the glass and the increased air space and thickness qualified the lens for a new patent.) The mounting of the telescope is made in part from a landing gear off a World War II, P-38 fighter.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{improvements}} {{included the}} use of a single lens in most lens trains, making the unit lighter and more efficient in regards to light output, and a rotating barrel containing lens <b>tube</b> <b>assembly,</b> shutters, and accessory slot to allow increased precision in use of the shutters and/or more easily registering gobos.|$|E
5000|$|Electrons {{from the}} cathode collide with the anode material, usually tungsten, {{molybdenum}} or copper, and accelerate other electrons, ions and nuclei within the anode material. About 1% {{of the energy}} generated is emitted/radiated, usually perpendicular to {{the path of the}} electron beam, as X-rays. The rest of the energy is released as heat. Over time, tungsten will be deposited from the target onto the interior surface of the tube, including the glass surface. This will slowly darken the tube and was thought to degrade the quality of the X-ray beam. Vaporized tungsten condenses {{on the inside of the}} envelope over the [...] "window" [...] and thus acts as an additional filter and decreases the tubes ability to radiate heat. Eventually, the tungsten deposit may become sufficiently conductive that at high enough voltages, arcing occurs. The arc will jump from the cathode to the tungsten deposit, and then to the anode. This arcing causes an effect called [...] "crazing" [...] on the interior glass of the X-ray window. As time goes on, the tube becomes unstable even at lower voltages, and must be replaced. At this point, the <b>tube</b> <b>assembly</b> (also called the [...] "tube head") is removed from the X-ray system, and replaced with a new <b>tube</b> <b>assembly.</b> The old <b>tube</b> <b>assembly</b> is shipped to a company that reloads it with a new X-ray tube.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{circular}} hexagonal honeycomb {{structures and}} <b>tube</b> <b>assemblies</b> in energy absorption systems {{has attracted a}} large number of literature on their characterization under crushing and impact loads. Notwithstanding these, effective shear moduli (G*) required for complete transverse elastic characterization and in analyses of hierarchical structures have received scant attention. In an attempt to fill this void, the present study undertakes to evaluate G* of a generalized circular honeycomb structures and <b>tube</b> <b>assemblies</b> in a diamond array structure (DAS) with no restriction on their thickness. These structures present a potential to realize a spectrum of moduli with minimal modifications, a point of relevance for manufactures and designers. To evaluate G* in this paper, models based on technical theories - thin ring theory and curved beam theory - and rigorous theory of elasticity are investigated and corroborated with FEA employing contact elements. Technical theories which give a good match for thin HCS offer compact expressions for moduli which can be harvested to study sensitivity of moduli on topology. On the other hand, elasticity model offers a very good match over a large range of thickness along with exact analysis of stresses by employing computationally efficient expressions.
