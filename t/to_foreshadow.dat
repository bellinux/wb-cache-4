Most importantly perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.|$|E

She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. <b>To</b> <b>foreshadow</b> this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal Punishment through minor roles in Innocent Sin. Eternal Punishment began full development after the release of Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal Punishment, the development team took what they learned from Innocent Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making Eternal Punishment was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

Decius might have performed some heroic act which then enabled him {{to become the first}} of his family to reach the consulship in 340, but if so no detail of the historical event survives. Instead later annalists have combined the disaster at the Caudine Forks with the tale of the military tribune of 258 to produce the entirely fictitious story recorded by Livy, the difference being that while in the originals the Romans suffered defeat and death, here none of Decius' men are killed and the Romans win a great victory.|$|E

5000|$|By analogy <b>to</b> <b>foreshadowing,</b> the {{literary}} critic Gary Morson described its opposite, sideshadowing. Found {{notably in the}} epic novels of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, it is the practice of including scenes that {{turn out to have}} no relevance to the plot. This, according to Morson, increases the verisimilitude of the fiction because the audience knows that in real life, unlike in novels, most events are in fact inconsequential. This [...] "sense of structurelessness" [...] invites the audience to [...] "interpret and question the events that actually do come to pass".|$|R
25|$|The {{primary failure}} {{condition}} in adventure games, inherited from more action-oriented games, is player death. Without the clearly identified enemies of other genres, its inclusion in adventure games is controversial, and many developers now either avoid it or take extra steps <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> death. Some early adventure games trapped {{the players in}} unwinnable situations without ending the game. Infocom's text adventure The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy {{has been criticized for}} a scenario where failing to pick up a pile of junk mail {{at the beginning of the}} game prevented the player, much later, from completing the game. The adventure games developed by LucasArts purposely avoided creating a dead-end situation for the player due to the negative reactions to such situations.|$|E

50|$|A flashforward (also spelled flash-forward; {{also called}} a prolepsis) {{is a scene}} that {{temporarily}} takes the narrative forward in time from the current point of the story in literature, film, television and other media. Flashforwards are often used to represent events expected, projected, or imagined {{to occur in the}} future. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. It is similar <b>to</b> <b>foreshadowing,</b> in which future events are not shown but rather implicitly hinted at. It is primarily a postmodern narrative device, named by analogy to the more traditional flashback (or analepsis), which reveals events that occurred in the past.|$|R
500|$|The two {{scenes in}} which murderers attack Banquo and Fleance, Lady Macduff and Macduff's son, have been {{compared}} to Herod's attempt to murder Christ and save the throne for himself by killing all new-born children in Bethlehem. The conversation between Fleance and Banquo in their own murder scene is especially dark. Banquo's first line from within [...] "Give us a light there, ho!" [...] communicates the nighttime setting. The stage direction [...] "Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE, with a torch", seems <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> the fact that Fleance is a light for Scotland {{in the midst of}} the play's black deeds.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} greater variety of stories {{in the first half of}} series 6 [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was moved to the second block of episodes, having been filmed as episode four and showing up in promos for the first half of the season. This necessitated minor changes to the episode, {{including}} the removal of a recurring sequence featuring the appearance of Madame Kovarian. The original last scene was dropped, and a new one was written so it would make sense at that point in the series. This scene consisted of nursery rhyme; lead writer Steven Moffat wanted <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> the Doctor's death and asked Gatiss to write a nursery rhyme, which he described as [...] "rather wonderful". Variations of the rhyme are heard in [...] "Closing Time" [...] and the series finale [...] "The Wedding of River Song".|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare's {{account of}} the battle was mostly based on chroniclers Edward Hall's and Raphael Holinshed's {{dramatic}} versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar Thomas More, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. [...] The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. Margaret of Anjou died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in Henry VI. [...] Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. [...] Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts {{that he will be}} evil, if such needed to retain his crown.|$|E

5000|$|The story {{starts with}} an elderly gentleman named Eddie {{who works as}} the head of {{maintenance}} at an amusement park called Ruby Pier, also known as Salty Pier. Eddie is a face known to regulars at the pier and is sometimes jokingly referred to as [...] "Eddie Maintenance" [...] due to the positioning of the patches on his work uniform. Eddie is able to perform his job (a job he inherited from his dad despite discontentment with life at the pier) despite a crippling leg injury he received as a soldier during World War II. Supposedly, rumors had been spread that Eddie had gotten into an altercation with a man in his platoon during the war - and [...] "nobody knew what happened to the other guy. Nobody asked."

Within the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, Volume 47, Rachel Seftel reviewed the novel.

500|$|As with {{previous}} Star Wars films, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menaces [...] score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams {{decided to use}} electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to [...] "capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra {{might not have been}} able to provide", and create an atmosphere that was [...] "more mysterious and mystical and less military" [...] than those of the original trilogy. One of the most notable tracks is [...] "Duel of the Fates", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video. While composing Anakin's theme, Williams tried to reflect the innocence of his childhood and <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> his transformation into Darth Vader by using slight suggestions of [...] "The Imperial March" [...] in the melody.|$|E
500|$|... on October 16th Ted Dibiase {{defeated}} Randy Savage in {{the finals}} of the [...] King of The Ring Tournament [...] The Mega Powers continued to team together after the event, until a new storyline was developed where Randy Savage became jealous over Hulk Hogan paying attention to Miss Elizabeth, and as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion felt slighted over his perceived lower billing in the Mega Powers' pecking order. Several key events were developed <b>to</b> <b>foreshadow</b> their burgeoning feud. These included Hogan asking Elizabeth to accompany him to televised matches, where he would act overly friendly with her; and accidentally eliminating Savage from the Royal Rumble in January 1989 by knocking him over the top rope and to the floor. The final falling out happened on The Main Event, when Elizabeth received an on-screen injury during a tag team match. Savage, left alone in the ring while Hogan tended to Elizabeth, attacked Hogan backstage. This rivalry culminated in a match for Savage's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V, where Hogan won the title by pinning Savage.|$|E

Most illuminating are the special occasions in which he cultivated his friendship with his young friends, and among these his photographic practice is particularly important. As a matter of fact, his ‘glass-house’ becomes a sort of stage where the photographic sitting alternates with his narration of stories invented or reelaborated in that moment for and with his child friends/models.

40|$|This article aims at {{investigating}} {{and explaining}} {{the application of}} the technique of flashback in selected Northern Sotho literary texts. Five kinds of flashback are distinguished, namely external retrospection, internal retrospection, mixed retrospection, flashback to complicate events and flashback of similar events. These kinds of flashback have certain and specific functions, such as reminding readers of past events, foregrounding themes of the text, and so on. This technique is evident in a text when ordinary, everyday events {{turn out to be the}} key to surprising secrets that are revealed later. Though flashback seems to be similar <b>to</b> <b>foreshadowing</b> (prolepsis) in that both techniques contain features of repetition and the narration of a specific experience, the techniques, however, differ in that flashback focuses on the elements of secrecy, suspense and surprise, and foreshadowing does not. This article also reveals that a relationship between flashback and the structure of detective stories can be indicated...|$|R
