40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{computer simulation}} model is developed for dynamic analysis of high-mobility tracked vehicles {{fitted with a}} trailing arm suspension system. The simulation model is oriented as a design tool for detailed analysis of vehicle suspension dynamics and ride quality assessment, The Lagranyian model formulation of a tracked vehicle is derived by considering a rigid terrain of an arbitrary profile and constant forward vehicle speed. The model incorporates detailed representations of a vehicle suspension system and dynamic wheel-track-terrain interactions. The wheel forces are evaluated based on an adaptive footprint formulation of a wheelltrack-terrain contact patch, and the track forces are modelled based on kinematic considerations. The computer model predictions are validated against field measurements, which were gathered from an extensive field testing of an in-service armoured personnel carrier. The comparison between measured and simulated dynamic responses exhibits a fairly close correlation.

50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the <b>track</b> <b>sagged</b> and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and flat wire ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{machines}} only {{lifted the}} track and packed the ballast. More modern machines, sometimes known as a tamper-liner or tamping and lining machine, also correct the alignment of the rails to make them parallel and level, {{in order to achieve}} a more comfortable ride for passengers and freight and to reduce the mechanical strain applied to the rails by passing trains. This is done by finding places where the sleepers have sunk from the weight of the passing trains or frost action, causing the <b>track</b> to <b>sag.</b> The tamper lifts each sleeper and the rails up, and packs ballast underneath. When the sleeper is laid down again, the sagged rails now sit at the proper level. In cases where frost action has caused adjacent rails to rise higher, ballast tampers can raise rails above their original level to make the line level again. [...] "Lining" [...] rails doesn't involve ballast tamping, it merely ensures the rails are perfectly parallel and straight as possible. Combining tamping and lining into a single machine saves time and money, as only one machine needs to be run over the track to perform both functions.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{tools for}} the thermoforming of unfilled thermoplastic polymers already exist for a while, but are seldom used to full extent in industry. When it is used, {{it is mostly}} only for comparative studies and prediction of relative wall thickness. One of the major reasons is the difficulty to correctly calibrate and integrate all necessary material and process parameters into the simulation software. This paper introduces and validates a methodology, in which digital image correlation (DIC) is used as the key enabling technology that improves {{the knowledge of the}} process parameters and optimizes simulation accuracy by taking away a number of uncertainties and assumptions. DIC in combination with infrared thermal measurements and pressure monitoring is used to <b>track</b> sheet <b>sagging</b> and bubble inflation of a HIPS sheet, the two main process steps in the thermoforming of positive (male) products or the only two steps in the case of free forming. The results of these in-situ measurements are used as a guideline for selecting the correct input parameters in the commercial thermoforming simulation software T-SIM®. A similar methodology can be further implemented for subsequent process steps such as forming and cooling or even to validate the material data used in the simulation software. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Bridgehampton Race Circuit was a race <b>track</b> {{located near}} <b>Sag</b> Harbor, New York, United States. The circuit opened in 1957, {{following}} {{a series of}} road races held from 1949 until 1953. It {{was one of the}} first permanent road racing venues in the United States, opening after Thompson Speedway, two years after Road America, the year after Watkins Glen International, and the same year as Lime Rock Park and Laguna Seca Raceway. [...] In its early years, Bridgehampton was host to major international series, including the World Sportscar Championship, Can-Am, and NASCAR Grand National. By the early 1970s, the track was used mostly for amateur events. From its opening day to the mid 90's the AMA (Championship Cup Series in the 90's) hosted events twice a month and was a favorite to many motorcycle road racers. The track closed permanently in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the Ferko lawsuit (in which a {{shareholder}} sued NASCAR, alleging a failed promise to schedule a race to a competing <b>track),</b> and the <b>sagging</b> attendance, the <b>track's</b> state of affairs was sharply altered. In the settlement, ISC sold Rockingham Speedway to Speedway Motorsports (SMI), and the track's lone remaining race was [...] "transferred" [...] to Texas Motor Speedway. Some NASCAR fans saw things differently, however, because it was Darlington Raceway's prestigious Southern 500 removed from the schedule for the second race in Texas, and the date for The Rock was sent to Phoenix International Raceway. SMI agreed to host no NASCAR events at the track while it was under their ownership. Upon its exit from the NASCAR circuit, The Rock joined such facilities as Ontario Motor Speedway, Riverside International Raceway, North Wilkesboro Speedway, Texas World Speedway, and Music City Motorplex as tracks removed from the circuit.|$|R
