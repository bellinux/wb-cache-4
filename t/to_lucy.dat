5|$|To {{appeal to}} Degrassi's {{established}} audience, {{a number of}} references to events which occurred in Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High and School's Out were written into the episode. Throughout those two series, Joey would frequently wear a fedora which became that character's trademark prop. The fedora made a reappearance in this episode, and was worn by Manny, Spike, Snake, Caitlin and Lucy, but not Joey, and it appeared in every scene which featured a character from the old series. The accident in School's Out when Wheels hit Lucy while drink-driving was discussed twice, first at the bar when the characters were discussing their lives, and a second time when Wheels came to the reunion to apologize <b>to</b> <b>Lucy.</b> Finally, Joey and Caitlin made amends; their relationship had ended when he cheated on her with Tessa in School's Out.|$|E
