40|$|We derive {{the single}} {{molecule}} {{equation of state}} (force-extension relation) for DNA molecules bearing <b>sliding</b> <b>loops</b> and deflection defects. Analytical results are obtained in the large force limit by employing an analogy with instantons in quantum mechanical tunneling problems. The results reveal a remarkable feature of <b>sliding</b> <b>loops</b> - an apparent strong reduction of the persistence length. We generalize these results to several other experimentally interesting situations ranging from rigid DNA-protein loops {{to the problem of}} anchoring deflections in AFM stretching of semiflexible polymers. Expressions relating the force-extension measurements to the underlying loop/boundary deflection geometry are provided and applied to the case of the GalR-loop complex. The theoretical predictions are complemented and quantitatively confirmed by MD simulations. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

30|$|The {{methods for}} peak {{detection}} consist of three main processes: (1) feature extraction, (2) feature selection, and (3) classification. In feature extraction stage, <b>three-points</b> <b>sliding</b> window method (Dumpala et al. 1982; Billauer 2012) is employed to identify all possible peak candidates. The AMSKF feature selector {{is used to}} select the best combination of features for all possible peak candidates. All identified peak candidates with the selected associated features are then classified by the NNRW classifier. The choice of classification method was supported by two reasons: (1) the NNRW provides fast learning speed. (2) The fast learning speed capability in the proposed AMSKF technique can minimize the computational complexity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{model the}} full {{dynamics}} of a rigid part in <b>three-point</b> frictional <b>sliding</b> {{contact with a}} flat rigid 6 -degree-offreedom plate. Given a periodic plate motion and the geometric, inertial, and frictional properties of the part, we define an asymptotic twist field mapping each part configuration to a unique part twist (linear and angular velocity). Asymptotic twist vectors in the field approximate the part’s cycle-averaged twist at each configuration and are independent of time or the system’s initial state. Simulations and experiments show that the trajectory of the part’s configuration as it slides on the plate is well described by the field. With the ability to program arbitrary plate motions, part manipulation reduces to finding plate motions that generate asymptotic twist fields to accomplish desired tasks. Several simple fields useful for manipulation tasks (e. g., sensorless part alignment) are verified in simulation and experiment. For the special case of a rigid part with infinitesimal thickness, we show that the part’s cycle-averaged twist for any configuration asymptotically converges to a unique asymptotic twist vector.

These protein complexes {{have a common}} ATPase domain and energy from the hydrolysis of ATP allows these remodeling complexes to reposition (<b>slide,</b> twist or <b>loop)</b> nucleosomes along the DNA, expel histones away from DNA or facilitate exchange of histone variants, and thus creating nucleosome-free regions of DNA for gene activation. Also, several remodelers have DNA-translocation activity to carry out specific remodeling tasks.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{multiphase}} sliding mode (MPSM) {{control method}} with a master–slave structure is proposed and analyzed {{in order to}} suppress ripples at input terminals or output terminals in DC/DC converter applications. With the proposed MPSM, the switching frequency of a multiphase DC/DC converter {{does not need to}} be operating such a high switching frequency as adopted in a conventional sliding mode control-based DC/DC converter. As a result, switching power losses could be reduced in this converter. Another advantage of this proposed method is that the master–slave multiphase <b>slide</b> control <b>loop</b> could figure out a proper phase shift between each switching phase of a DC/DC converter instead of precalculated phase shift. The proposed concepts are proven by the PSIM computer simulations and the feasibility of the proposed concepts is validated through the test experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{versatility}} offered by the use of arch wires with boot loops in retraction mechanics while taking direct anchorage from mini-screws. Materials and Methods: The materials include the mini screws placed at the appropriate location and retraction arches made of 0. 019 X 0. 025 SS with boot loops placed distal to the lateral incisors. Mini screw provides a stable anchorage for enmasse retraction of the anterior teeth with the help of a boot <b>loop</b> using <b>sliding</b> and/or <b>loop</b> mechanics. Results: The arch wires with boot loops have a definite advantage over the soldered/ crimpable hooks because of the versatility it offers during the process of retraction.

50|$|In {{technical}} diving {{donation of}} the primary demand valve is commonly the standard procedure, and the primary {{is connected to the}} first stage by a long hose, typically around 2 m, to allow gas sharing while swimming in single file in a narrow space as might be required in a cave or wreck. In this configuration the secondary is generally held under the chin by a loose bungee loop around the neck, supplied by a shorter hose, and is intended for backup use by the diver donating gas. The backup regulator is usually carried in the diver's chest area where it can be easily seen and accessed for emergency use. It may be worn secured by a breakaway clip on the buoyancy compensator, plugged into a soft friction socket attached to the harness, secured by <b>sliding</b> a <b>loop</b> of the hose into the shoulder strap cover of a jacket style BC, or suspended under the chin on a break-away bungee loop known as a necklace. These methods also keep the secondary from dangling below the diver and being contaminated by debris or snagging on the surroundings. Some divers store it in a BC pocket, but this reduces availability in an emergency.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The falling {{prices of}} LCD {{technologies}} {{have led to}} a prolifer-ation of large public displays. Today, most of these displays show simple <b>slide</b> shows or <b>loop</b> through a set of movies in isolation, yet efforts are un-derway to network these displays together on a global scale. Networked public display would go beyond simple ad-pushing and open up towards truly personalized services, such as support for navigation tasks, messag-ing, emergency services, and of course context-aware advertising. Moving from personalized Web content to personalized public display content, however, leads to novel challenges that limit the applicability of exist-ing personalization solutions. This article enumerates the key research challenges that stem from bringing personalization to public displays, namely in the areas of user identification; profile location; profile con-tent; content tailoring; model refinement; and applications that require personalisation. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{object of}} this {{invention}} {{is to provide}} robust nonlinear controllers for robotic operations in unstructured environments based upon {{a new class of}} closed <b>loop</b> <b>sliding</b> control methods, sometimes denoted terminal sliders, where the new class will enforce closed-loop control convergence to equilibrium in finite time. Improved performance results from the elimination of high frequency control switching previously employed for robustness to parametric uncertainties. Improved performance also results from the dependence of terminal slider stability upon the rate of change of uncertainties over the sliding surface rather than the magnitude of the uncertainty itself for robust control. Terminal sliding mode control also yields improved convergence where convergence time is finite and is to be controlled. A further object is to apply terminal sliders to robot manipulator control and benchmark performance with the traditional computed torque control method and provide for design of control parameters...|$|R
