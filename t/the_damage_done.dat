While annual repair work helped stem <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{underwent}} further {{surgery in}} January 2008 to hopefully restore {{his voice and}} address the complications from his previous surgeries. On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further surgery was performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert was using a prosthetic chin to hide some of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by his many chin, mouth, and throat surgeries.|$|E
5|$|In a June 2006 {{report on}} the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{admitted}} that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina.

5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as a pest, {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done,</b> and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E
5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted {{by the smell of}} bruised tissue.|$|E
50|$|There is, however, one {{way that}} {{speculative}} damages can be recovered. If the plaintiff can prove that <b>the</b> speculative <b>damages</b> are reasonably likely to occur, he can recover <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> up to <b>the</b> amount that is reasonably likely to occur. <b>The</b> <b>damages</b> <b>do</b> {{not have to be}} proven with absolute certainty, only reasonable certainty.|$|R

5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 Japanese soldiers and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to Japan's infrastructure, combined with a severe famine in 1946, further complicated the Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E
5|$|The red poppies that McCrae {{referred}} to had {{been associated with}} conflict since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to the landscape in Flanders during the battle greatly increased the lime content in the surface soil, leaving the poppy {{as one of the}} few plants able to grow in the region.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Wilson was Chief of Development Engineering at United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters, {{and was the}} USAAF {{liaison officer}} to the Manhattan Project. In December 1944 he became Chief of Staff of the 316th Bombardment Wing. Its B-29s {{deployed}} to Okinawa in June 1945, and he participated in the last air raids on Japan. After the war ended {{he was involved in}} a survey of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

50|$|The {{performance}} of each {{vehicle in the}} game was unique. Not only with respect to engine power, but also areas such as tire grip, suspension stiffness, steering tightness, and between different drive-trains such as front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive. The game also features <b>the</b> possibility of <b>damaging</b> <b>the</b> vehicles, although <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>does</b> not affect performance.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by the bullet, the autopsy {{also found that}} the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to Eindhoven was {{significant}} {{and can be}} considered a victory for JG 3. It was also assisted by elements of JG 6 which had misidentified Eindhoven as one their targets. The greatest losses were amongst the Recce Wing and the Canadian 124 Wing RCAF, which suffered 24 aircraft destroyed or damaged. The visiting 39 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged. 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed. It is likely that I./JG 3 was responsible for about 2/3 of the damage. Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to {{the castle}} during the second siege was {{immediately}} repaired in 1216 and 1221 by Cigogne on behalf of John's successor Henry III, who further strengthened the defences. The walls of the Lower Ward were rebuilt in stone, complete with a gatehouse in {{the location of the}} future Henry VIII Gate, between 1224 and 1230. Three new towers, the Curfew, Garter and the Salisbury towers, were constructed. The Middle Ward was heavily reinforced with a southern stone wall, protected by the new Edward III and Henry III towers at each end.|$|E

However, since they must wait a few months before they can get donors, Peter must undergo dialysis at regular intervals. Three weeks later, after undergoing constant dialysis procedures, Peter gets angry that the dialysis treatments have stolen him from the world. After being convinced by Joe and Quagmire that one skipping would not hurt him, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment but his assumptions are false and him skipping it causes him to become jaundiced and vomit blood.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Blücher and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to Lützow {{caused the}} German force to withdraw. The ground troops were {{landed on the}} eastern side of the fjord; they {{proceeded}} inland and captured the Oscarborg Fortress by 09:00 on 10 April. They then moved on to attack the capital. Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Blüchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city.|$|E

5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by recessive deleterious mutations, in {{a process known as}} inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
