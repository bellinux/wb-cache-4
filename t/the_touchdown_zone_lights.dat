40|$|Realistic {{predictions}} of service life of steel catenary risers (SCR) require an accurate characterization of seafloor stiffness {{in the region}} where the riser contacts the seafloor, <b>the</b> so-called <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> This thesis presents the initial stage of development of a simplified seafloor support model. This model simulates the seafloor-pipe interaction as a flexible pipe supported {{on a bed of}} springs. Constants for the soil springs were derived from finite element studies performed in a separate, parallel investigation. These supports are comprised of elasto-plastic springs with spring constants being a function of soil stiffness and strength, and the geometry of the trench within <b>the</b> <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> Deflections and bending stresses in the pipe are computed based on a finite element method and a finite difference formulation developed in this research project. The finite difference algorithm has capabilities for analyzing linear springs, non-linear springs, and springs having a tension cut-off. The latter feature simulates the effect of a pipe pulling out of contact with the soil. The model is used to perform parametric studies to assess the effects of soil stiffness, soil strength, trench geometry, amplitude of pipe displacements, pipe stiffness, and length of <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> on pipe deflections and bending stresses. In conclusions, the seafloor stiffness (as characterized by the three spring parameters), the magnitude of pipe displacement, and the length of <b>the</b> <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> all influence bending stresses in the pipe. Also, the tension cutoff effect, i. e., the pipe pulling away from the soil, can have a very large effect on bending stresses in the pipe.

40|$|Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) is {{a popular}} {{solution}} for a floating production facility in the deep and ultra-deep ocean. In the analysis of SCR, the behavioral characteristics are investigated to check the failure modes by assessing the magnitude {{and the frequency of}} the stress and strain which SCR goes through in time series. SCR is affected by the motions of connected floating production facility and exciting environmental loads. The driven force and motion of SCR has an interaction with seabed soil which represents the stiffness and friction force where SCR touches the seabed. Dynamic response of SCR is primarily caused by the coupled motion of floating structure. The displacement of floating structure is often large and fast enough to cause short cycles of negative and positive tension on SCR. The interaction between SCR and seabed is concentrated at <b>the</b> <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> resulting into <b>the</b> compression and corresponding deformation of pipeline at the position.

This section is a critical to the fatigue life of Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs) as it consists of a repetitive complex fluid-riser-soil interaction and often contains the maximum deflection and bending moment. Current practice and design programs typically assume a flat, rigid, "non-interacting" seabed and do {{not account for the}} complex nonlinear processes associated with the repetitive interaction of the riser with the seabed and trench formation. An important step forward in the state-of-the-art would therefore be to improve the fluid-riser-soil interaction models that are currently used in the analysis and design procedures for steel catenary risers.

40|$|Steel {{catenary}} risers (SCR) {{are widely}} used in deepwater oil and gas production. Due to environmental loading the riser {{may be subject to}} six degrees of motion; however, in <b>the</b> <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> (TDZ), <b>the</b> vertical penetration into the seabed and uplift are two of the main components. The riser-seabed-water interaction near <b>the</b> <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> {{is one of the main}} concerns in fatigue life design of SCR. During upward displacement, suction develops under the riser and a trench might be formed when it separates from the seabed near <b>the</b> <b>touchdown</b> point (TDP). In subsequent downward movement, the riser penetrates through this trench to the seabed. Therefore, modeling of suction and trench formation is very important. In most of the existing models these factors are incorporated using empirical relationships. It is also recognized that the available finite element (FE) modeling techniques for this large deformation problem are computationally very expensive, although the penetration resistance can be simulated. In the present study, numerical modeling of riser-seabed-water interaction at the TDZ is conducted using ANSYS CFX software to evaluate the response of the riser during its penetration and uplift. A new model for undrained shear strength of soft clay is proposed that is applicable to a wide range of shear strain rates. The models for the effects of strain rate and strength degradation on undrained shear strength are incorporated properly in ANSYS CFX and simulations are performed for one penetration-uplift cycle. The CFX model developed in this study using the subdomain approach is computationally very efficient. It is found that the suction under the riser is the main source of uplift resistance for shallow embedments. The parametric study shows that the maximum uplift resistance and depth of trench depend on uplift velocity and undrained shear strength of clay...|$|R

Therefore, a systematic strength analysis {{is required for the}} proper design of an SCR. However, deepwater SCR analysis is a new research area.

The structural behavior of a deepwater SCR under various environmental loading conditions was investigated, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted with respect to various parameters such as the SCR weight, weight of the internal contents, hang-off angle (HOA), and vertical soil stiffness. Based on a deepwater SCR design example, it was found that the maximum stress of an SCR occurred at a hang-off location under parallel loading direction with respect to the riser plane, except for a wave dominant dynamic survival loading condition. Furthermore, the tensile stress governed the total stress of the SCRs, whereas the bending stress governed the total stress at the TDZ.
