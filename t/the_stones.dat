5|$|Dallas {{delivers}} Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, whereupon it {{is revealed}} {{that she is}} the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, as they entrusted <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> to the alien Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain <b>the</b> <b>stones,</b> but their surviving compatriots determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple designed to house <b>the</b> <b>stones,</b> then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stone</b> {{representation}} of a Boolean algebra is always separative and compact; the corresponding Boolean space is known as <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> space of <b>the</b> Boolean algebra. The clopen sets of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> space are then precisely the complexes of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> representation. <b>The</b> area of mathematics known as Stone duality is founded {{on the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> {{representation of}} a Boolean algebra can be recovered purely from <b>the</b> corresponding <b>Stone</b> space whence a duality exists between Boolean algebras and Boolean spaces.|$|R

5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> to their hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, and the future of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. <b>The</b> <b>stones</b> were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E

5|$|Plavalaguna {{is killed}} when the Mangalores attack the cruise ship, but Dallas succeeds in {{retrieving}} <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> from the Diva. During his {{struggle with the}} Mangalores he kills their leader. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo before taking a carrying case that he presumes contains <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg.

5|$|The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, {{first saw}} <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> and pictured them {{reassembled}} as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his {{first day in}} California. He arrived that day in San Francisco {{to serve as a}} new monk in Vina, California, at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux. The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes. Davis's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> sitting among the weeds. From time to time in subsequent years, Davis inspected <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> only to find them in increasingly poor condition.|$|E
50|$|These are {{cracks in}} <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> that {{resemble}} <b>the</b> design of feathers. The presence of feathers in a diamond usually {{does not affect}} the life of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> unless and until the feather runs through a major length of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> or shows major stress points where it can break. If the cracks reach the surface or have deep fissures, the durability of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> may be reduced with the possibility of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> breaking with age.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stone</b> of Jacob {{appears in}} the Book of Genesis as <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> used as a pillow by the Israelite patriarch Jacob at the place later called Bet-El. As Jacob had a vision in his sleep, he then consecrated <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> to God. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> has been claimed by Scottish {{folklore}} and British Israelism.|$|R
50|$|The {{other type}} of stone is generically called faceted, in which <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> has <b>the</b> general overall shape of the modern diamond, with a thin edge, called the girdle, the top angling up into {{what is called the}} crown, and the bottom angling down into what is called the pavilion. In the case of a cabochon <b>stone,</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> is usually cut at a shallow angle, so that when the bezel is pushed over <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> that angle permits it to hold <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> in place and keep it tight. In the case of faceted stones a shallow groove is cut {{into the side of the}} bezel into which the girdle of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> is placed, and then metal is pushed over, holding <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> in place. Cabochons can also be set into prong {{settings}} of various kinds, but the idea is the same—it is the prongs going over the angle of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> that creates <b>the</b> pressure that holds <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> in place.|$|R
5|$|The area {{appears to}} have been of some {{importance}} in the early Christian period, as evidenced by the Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans Church, and now housed in the small museum there. <b>The</b> <b>stones</b> had been used in the building of the old church and many had been badly damaged. One of <b>the</b> <b>stones,</b> the 9th century Drosten Stone, has the distinction of being one of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text: 'DROSTEN: IREUORET TTFOR CUS', which has been interpreted in various ways, but it is thought to refer to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned between 839 and 842AD.|$|E
5|$|The four join up with David at {{the weapon}} chamber {{in the temple}} as the great evil approaches.

Dallas confesses his love for Leeloo and kisses her. In response, Leeloo combines the power of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> and releases the divine light on the great evil, destroying its power and causing the planet to be proclaimed dead by Earth scientists as it becomes another moon in Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> to the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stone</b> {{has been}} dated to the Middle Ages. The Catholic Encyclopedia states the date as April 25, 1135. William Thalbitzer dates <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> to 1314 using pentadic numerals. Others have dated <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> between 1250 and 1333. However, as the {{historian}} Finn Gad has pointed out, the date given on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> {{can be interpreted}} in various ways. As such, it cannot, as previously thought, be taken as evidence for the three hunters named on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> in this region.|$|R
5000|$|Recently {{discovered}} [...] "insights" [...] {{found their}} way into this new version, which even speculated about <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> louse's participation in the fall of the Berlin Wall, since the wall was mainly placed in areas [...] "commonly inhabited by <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> louse". That theory was reinforced by [...] "discoveries" [...] that <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> louse might have been used by the Spartans to bring down the ancient Athenians' Long Walls. Other hypotheses connect <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> louse with <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stones</b> {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5|$|This {{view was}} {{the norm for}} some time after Boece and is {{reflected}} in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> were Scandinavian in origin, there was also ample evidence that <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> were Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E
5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing stones {{in the garden}} of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones are likely to have been the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.|$|E
50|$|The shrine also {{houses a}} rock called ahokashisan. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> is {{believed}} to possess magical properties. If a person rubs <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> and then rubs an injured area of their body, {{it is said that}} they will heal quicker than normal. Furthermore, if a person taps <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> three times, then lifts it, <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> will feel heavy. Afterwards, if the same person strokes <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> three times while making a wish and then lifts it for a second time and <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> feels light, it is said that their wish will be granted. The ahokashisan, as well as Yasurai Matsuri, are designated Important Cultural Properties.|$|R
50|$|The proprietors of Blarney Castle list {{several other}} {{explanations}} {{of the origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> on their website. Many of these suppose that <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> had previously been in Ireland, was taken to Scotland and then returned to Ireland in 1314. The stories listed include one suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was presented to Cormac McCarthy by Robert the Bruce in 1314 in recognition of his support in the Battle of Bannockburn. This legend holds that this was a piece of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> of Scone and was installed at McCarthy's castle of Blarney. Although colourful, this folk legend does not account for the fact that it supposes that <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was removed from Scotland 18 years before Bannockburn, and modern analysis suggests that <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> is not related to <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> of Scone.|$|R
50|$|When placing <b>the</b> <b>stone,</b> {{take care}} that long sleeves are brushed up to avoid {{knocking}} stones already played. To place <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> on <b>the</b> board, {{as soon as}} the fingertip of index finger is about to reach the surface of the board, it slips to the side, allowing the middle finger to aim <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> down towards <b>the</b> surface and connect (the other fingers and thumb naturally spread outwards). With a little practice a stone can be placed gracefully and forcefully and with a big click. The keys to a loud click are the force of the middle finger and the late release of <b>the</b> <b>stone.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> has been placed, the middle finger and hand slowly lifts off <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> (trying to avoid wobbling <b>the</b> <b>stone)</b> and gently retreats back to the player.|$|R
5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> to glow red hot. Two of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E
