40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was aimed at {{evaluating}} the contribution of <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in the screening for prostate neoplasias and in the guidance of prostate biopsies. Materials and Methods: Prospective study developed over a one-year period. All the patients with indication for prostate biopsy were evaluated. Regardless of PSA values, the patients underwent ultrasound {{in order to identify}} suspicious nodules (confirmed by two observers). Sextant biopsy was subsequently performed. In cases of finding suspicious nodules, an additional puncture directed to such nodules was done. Results: In a total of 155 cases the prevalence of malignancy was of 53 %. Suspicious nodules were detected in 34 patients, and 25 where malignant (positive predictive value of 74 %). The specificity and sensitivity for suspicious nodules were 88 % and 31 % respectively. Comparatively with the randomly obtained sextant specimens, the rate of findings of neoplasia was higher in the specimens obtained with puncture directed to the nodule (p = 0. 032). No statistically significant difference was observed in the Gleason score for both types of specimens (p = 0. 172). Conclusion: The high positive predictive value and the high rate of findings of neoplasia in specimens of suspicious nodules should be taken into consideration in the future. The authors suggest a biopsy technique similar to the one described in the present study (sextant biopsy plus puncture directed to the suspicious nodule) ...|$|R

Materials and methodsPatients between the ages of 40 years and 64 years who underwent <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> as part of a self-paid medical check-up were enrolled. Participant demographics, medical history, and voiding symptoms were assessed by the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaire. A multiple linear regression with stepwise selection was used to analyze the correlations between PV and all potential predictors. ResultsTwo hundred and twenty-eight men with bothersome LUTS (IPSS >  7) were enrolled as study participants at a mean age of 56. 4 years. Patients with PV > 25  mL were significantly older and had higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and scores for total IPSS, storage, urgency items, and nocturia items. DRE, serum PSA, age, and urgency score were independent predictors for PV, especially for men with PV > 25  mL, for which the standardized regression equation was PV =  0. 74  × (DRE estimation)  +  0. 10  × (age)  +  0. 12  × (serum PSA)  +  0. 079  × (urgency score) (adjusted R 2  =  0. 80). ConclusionIn the current study, we confirmed that serum PSA, age, and urgency score are significant predictors of PV.

40|$|Transrectal {{ultrasound}} (TRUS) is {{an important}} tool in diagnosing prostate cancer. However, specificity and sensitivity of conventional grey-scale TRUS {{for the detection of}} prostate cancer are disappointingly low. New ultrasound modalities are designed to overcome the disappointing results and improve the use of ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This work is a review of the recent literature, combined with own experiences. The papers were collected using a Medline search, combined with some papers by author selection.

The authors used their own experiences for illustrations of various techniques. Although several modalities show a significant improvement in sensitivity and specificity for the detection of prostate cancer, none of the TRUS modalities discussed can replace prostate biopsies as a definitive diagnostic. Several techniques, especially contrast ultrasound, show definitive promise. However, two valid conclusions can be made from the data presented.

40|$|Abstract—Automatic <b>prostate</b> {{segmentation}} in <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (TRUS) {{images is}} highly desired in many clinical applications. However, robust and automated prostate segmentation is challenging {{due to the}} low SNR in TRUS and the missing boundaries in shadow areas caused by calcifications or hyperdense prostate tissues. This paper presents a novel method of utilizing a priori shapes estimated from partial contours for segmenting the prostate. The proposed method is able to automatically extract prostate boundary from 2 -D TRUS images without user interaction for shape correction in shadow areas. During the segmentation process, missing boundaries in shadow areas are estimated by using a partial active shape model, which takes partial contours as input but returns a complete shape estimation. With this shape guidance, an optimal search is performed by a discrete deformable model to minimize an energy functional for image segmentation, which is achieved efficiently by using dynamic programming. The segmentation of an image is executed in a multiresolution fashion from coarse to fine for robustness and computational efficiency. Promising segmentation results were demonstrated on 301 TRUS images grabbed from 19 patients with the average mean absolute distance error of 2. 01 mm ± 1. 02 mm.

Various types of anaesthetic methods have been used. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and complication rate between periprostatic lidocaine infiltration and transrectal lidocaine gel in <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. All prostate biopsy patients were included except those with lidocaine, allergy, haemorrhagic diathesis, anticoagulation therapy, the inability to rate a visual analogue scale and inability to obtain consent. They were randomized into two groups. Group 1 received 20 ml 2 % transrectal lidocaine gel. Group 2 received 5 ml 1 % lidocaine infiltration for each periprostatic nerve block with 23 -gauge spinal needle. After three minutes, prostate biopsy was performed with an 18 gauge 7 -inch spring-loaded biopsy gun. Six biopsies were taken for each lobe. Pain during probe insertion, biopsy and immediately after the procedure was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale. Any complication immediately after procedure, one day or after one week, was recorded. Mean pain score was lower after periprostatic lidocaine infiltration compared to transrectal lidocaine gel (3. 1 + 1. 9 versus 4. 9 + 2. 4, p = 0. 027). There was no statistically significant difference in the complication rate. <b>Transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy using periprostatic lidocaine infiltration provides better anaesthesia as compared to the transrectal lidocaine gel application with no significant difference in complication.

We tested the efficacy {{and safety of}} combined perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block during <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 280 patients were randomized to receive combined perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block (group 1), perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream alone (group 2), periprostatic nerve block alone (group 3) or no anesthesia (group 4) before <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Pain was evaluated with a 10 -point visual analog scale at subsequent procedural steps, including perianal-intrarectal substance administration, <b>prostate</b> <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> periprostatic nerve block and sampling. Complications were assessed by self-administered questionnaire and telephone interview. RESULTS: The groups were comparable in patient age, prostate volume, pathology results and visual analog scale perianal-intrarectal substance administration. Visual analog scale results for transrectal ultrasound were lower in groups 1 and 2 vs 3 and 4 (mean 1. 5 and 1. 41 vs 5. 37 and 5. 31, p < 0. 001) and results for periprostatic nerve block were lower in group 1 vs 3 (mean 1. 03 vs 3. 74, p < 0. 001). Results for sampling were lower in groups 1 to 3 vs 4 (mean 0. 77, 1. 27 and 1. 27 vs 4. 33, p < 0. 001) and in group 1 vs 2 and 3 (p < 0. 001). Stratified analysis showed that visual analog scale sampling was lower in group 1 vs 2 and 3 in patients 65 years old or younger, those with a prostate greater than 49 cc and those with lower anorectal compliance (visual analog scale results for perianal-intrarectal substance administration greater than 2) (p = 0. 006, < 0. 001 and 0. 003, respectively). The overall complication rate was similar in all 4 groups (p = 0. 87).

We investigated the addition of intravenous (iv) piperacillin/tazobactam immediately prior to <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy with standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis to determine if it would decrease the incidence of serious infectious complications after <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. Group 1 patients were a historic control of 197 patients who underwent <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy with standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Group 2 patients, 104 patients, received standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and the addition of a single dose of iv piperacillin/tazobactam 30 minutes prior to <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There were ten serious bacterial infectious complications in group 1 patients. No patients in group 2 developed serious bacterial infections after <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There was approximately a 5 % incidence of serious bacterial infection in group 1 patients.

Objective: Our objective was to characterize prostate biopsy outcomes and trends in Chinese men over a 10 -year period, since {{the increasing use of}} PSA tests. Methods: All men (n = 1, 650) who underwent prostate biopsy for PCa at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China from 2003 – 2011 were evaluated. Demographic and clinical information was collected for each patient, including age, digital rectal examination (DRE), <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (<b>prostate</b> volume and nodule), total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels and free PSA ratio (fPSA/tPSA) prior to biopsy. Prostate biopsy was performed using six cores before October 2007 or ten cores thereafter. Logistic regression and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate our data.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the incidence, clinical features, pathogenic bacteria, and risk {{factors associated with}} acute prostatitis after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 923 transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsies of the prostate in 878 patients performed at our institution from June 2004 to May 2009. The indications for biopsy were generally serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation, abnormal findings on a digital rectal examination, or both. All biopsies were performed with the patient hospitalized except for 10 patients who refused to be hospitalized, and ciprofloxacin was administered as an antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence, clinical features, pathogenic bacteria, and potential risk factors associated with acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy were evaluated. Results: Acute prostatitis developed in 18 (2. 0 %) cases after prostate biopsy. Among them, 9 (1. 0 %) had bacteremia and 2 (0. 2 %) showed clinical features of sepsis. Of the total 50 urine or blood specimens sent for culture study, 27 (54. 0 %) specimens showed positive cultures, including E. coli in 25. Among the 27 culture-positive specimens, 26 (96. 3 %) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Among the potential risk factors for acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy, biopsy performed as an outpatient procedure without a cleansing enema (p= 0. 001) and past history of cerebrovascular accident (p= 0. 048) were statistically significant. Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone is effective as an antibiotic prophylaxis for <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy in most cases.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: After {{prostate}} biopsy, {{serious and}} life-threatening infections of resistant strains can develop and therefore fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis is widely used. This study aimed to examine infections in patients undergoing <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy with quinolone prophylaxis and {{to review the}} articles reported in this respect. Patients and Methods: In this study, 14 cases who followed {{for the development of}} infection after <b>transrectal</b> ultrasonography guided <b>prostate</b> biopsy between the years 2005 - 2010 at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology of Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Ten patients (% 71. 4) developed sepsis, 3 patients (21. 4 %) urinary tract infection (UTI), and 1 patient (7. 1 %) acute bacterial prostatitis. In seven out of 14 patients (50 %) bacteria growth was in blood culture, in 12 patients (85. 7 %) was in urine and in 5 patients (35. 7 %) was in both. E. coli was identified as the causative agent in all of the cases being the rate of extended spectrum of -lactamases (ESBL) in E. coli strains was 42. 8 %, quinolone resistance 92. 8 %. Conclusion: This study suggested that fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli should be considered as an important causative agent in infections after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThere is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} on the clinical efficacy and safety of the photoselective vaporization (PVP) of the prostate using the 180 W lithium triborate (LBO) laser. We report on initial outcomes of PVP with the 180 W laser, comparig the first 50 cases with the last 50 cases performed with the 120 W LBO laser. MethodsAll cases performed by a single surgeon (HHW) have been prospectively maintained. The last 50 cases treated with the 120 W LBO laser (December 2009 to August 2010) were compared with the first 50 cases treated with the 180 W LBO (July 2010 to June 2011). Patient variables were recorded preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively. Perioperative data was also recorded. ResultsThe 180 W cases had a larger median <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostate</b> volume (68 mL vs. 51 mL, P< 0. 05). For the 180 W and 120 W LBO lasers, total operating time was 64. 2 and 72. 5 minutes (not significant [NS] at P= 0. 22), lasering time 49. 6 and 54. 6 minutes (NS, P= 0. 30) and energy utilisation 477. 6 kJ and 377. 9 kJ (P< 0. 05) respectively. When compared per gram of prostate tissue lasered, the 180 W is quicker at 0. 67 min/g vs. 1. 0 min/g for the 120 W laser. Complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification included 5 grade 1 complications and 3 grade 3 b (bladder neck contractures) with the 180 W LBO laser. The 120 W LBO laser had 4 grade 1 complications and 1 grade 2. ConclusionsThere is little change in clinical outcomes with the transition from 120 W to 180 W LBO PVP with an already experienced PVP surgeon. The 180 W LBO laser appears to have impacted upon patient selection with significantly increased prostate size and associated with increased energy utilisation. There appears to be a trend toward shorter laser times...|$|R
40|$|Purpose : Improvements to photoselective {{vaporization}} of {{the prostate}} (PVP) have been made over time, particularly {{with the introduction of}} higher power systems. Few studies however have compared the performance of these systems to their predecessors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the clinical and perioperative outcomes of 80 W vs. 120 W PVP. Materials and Methods : A series of 267 and 209 consecutive patients underwent 80 W and 120 W PVP, respectively, from September 2001 to May 2009 at Weill Cornell Medical College (GreenLight TM laser system, American Medical Systems, Inc., Minnetonka, MN). Data were collected on patient demographics, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and perioperative parameters. Maximum flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual (PVR), and <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostate</b> volume were recorded. Statistical analyses were carried out utilizing the Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and unpaired t tests (SPSS 15. 0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results : Baseline parameters were similar between the two groups except for greater median age (72. 8 vs. 69. 2 years, p = 0. 01) and lower median PSA (2. 0 vs. 3. 3, p = 0. 01) in the 80 W group. Median laser time was longer in the 80 W group (85 vs. 51 minutes, p 0. 001) with a higher median energy utilized (253 vs. 210 kJ, p = 0. 001). Final IPSS, Qmax, PVR, and PSA were equivalent between the two groups. Conclusions : In our series, PVP was safe and effective. Durable and similar improvements in symptoms and objective parameters were achieved in patients with both 80 W and 120 W laser systems. PVP with the 120 W system, however, provided faster and more efficient vaporization compared to the 80 W system. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Age-specific {{prostate}} specific antigen (PSA) cutoffs {{for prostate}} biopsy {{have been widely}} used in the USA and European countries. However, the application of age-specific PSA remains poorly understood in China. Methods: Between 2003 and 2012, 1, 848 men over the age of 40, underwent prostate biopsy for prostate cancer (PCa) at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. Clinical information and blood samples were collected prior to biopsy for each patient. Men were divided into three age groups (# 60, 61 to 80, and. 80) for analyses. Digital rectal examination (DRE), <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (<b>prostate</b> volume and nodule), total PSA (tPSA), and free PSA (fPSA) were also included in the analyses. Logistic regression was used to build the multi-variate model. Results: Serum tPSA levels were age-dependent (P = 0. 008), while %fPSA (P = 0. 051) and PSAD (P = 0. 284) were age-independent. At a specificity of 80 %, the sensitivities for predicting PCa were 83 %, 71 % and 68 % with tPSA cutoff values of 19. 0 ng/mL (age# 60), 21. 0 ng/mL (age 61 – 80), and 23. 0 ng/mL (age$ 81). Also, sensitivities at the same tPSA levels were able to reach relatively high levels (70 %– 88 %) for predicting high-grade PCa. Area (AUC) under the receive operating curves (ROCs) of tPSA, %fPSA, PSAD and multi-variate model were different in age groups. When predicting PCa, the AUC of tPSA, %fPSA, PSAD and multi-variate model were 0. 90, 0. 57, 0. 93 and 0. 87 respectively in men # 60 yr; 0. 82, 0. 70, 0. 88 and 0. 86 respectively in men 61 – 80 yr; 0. 79, 0. 78, 0. 87 and 0. 88 respectively in men. 80 yr.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of prostate cancer}} among South African men is just as significant as it is worldwide [1, 2]. Although {{the role of the}} prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA 3) assay in predicting biopsy outcome has proven beneficial in a South African context [3], the assessment of its role incorporated into a prostate cancer risk calculator has not yet been explored on the continent of Africa. We aimed to assess the performance of the PCA 3 -incorporated Chun nomogram [4] and to compare its performance with other contemporary risk calculators. We prospectively evaluated 107 consecutive South African men that were already scheduled for a 13 -core <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy at two referral centres in the South African capital city, Pretoria. The urine PCA 3 assay was always performed prior to biopsy and was evaluated using the Progensa assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA). Performance of the following four calculators was compared: • Chun nomogram [4] • Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculator [5] • Updated (PCA 3 incorporated) PCPT risk calculator [5] • European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator [6] Histologic evidence of cancer in the prostate biopsy specimen was set as the primary end point. The discriminating ability of each risk calculator was assessed and compared using the concordance index (c-index). The mean patient age was 67 yr. A positive cancer outcome was present in 46 of 107 men, with only 19 of 107 scheduled for a repeat biopsy. Ultimately, 97 patients were assessed because 10 patients were excluded from the comparison data set due to inconclusive PCA 3 assay scores (2 of 10) and patient age < 55 yr (8 of 10). The four calculators had the following c-indexes: Chun nomogram, 0. 93 (95 % confidence interva...|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli {{meningitis}} is {{a frequent}} pathology in children younger than 3 years old, but is an uncommon disease in adults. E. coli infection is {{the main cause of}} intrahospital bacteremia {{as a consequence of the}} employment of different medical procedures. Our patient, male, 69 years old, presented with fever, progressive difficulty in breathing, and shivers 24 h after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy, with an absence of any other symptoms. He received prophylactic treatment with ciprofloxacin and later empirical treatment with ampicillin and tobramicin. After that, the patient presented with fever, headache, behavioral changes, somnolence, disorientation, a fluctuating level of conscience, cutaneous widespread pallor, and acute urinary retention. On physical exploration, we observed generalized hypoventilation, Glasgow 10, stiffness of the neck, inconclusive Kernig; the remaining neurological exploration was normal. Systematic of blood: leukocytes = 8, 510 /mm 3 (94. 5 % polymorphonuclear), platelet = 87, 000 /mm 3, pH = 7. 51, pCO 2 = 28. 8 mmHg, pO 2 = 61 mmHg, O 2 saturation = 93. 8 %, and remaining values were normal. Chest X- ray, cranial CT scan, urine cultures were normal. Blood culture: E. coli. CSF: glucose < 0. 4 g/l, total proteins = 3. 05 g/l, PMN = 7 cells. Microscopic examination of the CSF: Gram-negative bacilli; CSF's culture: abundant E. coli. The case of acute meningitis by multiresistant E. coli after <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostate</b> biopsy presented demonstrates that antibiotic prevention with ciprofloxacin is not absolutely risk free.
