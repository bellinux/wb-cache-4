5|$|After the siege, the Ottomans {{went on to}} take Morea in 1460, and Trebizond in 1461. With {{the fall}} of Trebizond came {{the end of the}} Roman Empire; the Palaeologan dynasty {{continued}} to be recognized as <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> emperors of Constantinople by the crowned heads of Europe until the 16th century when the Reformation, the Ottoman threat to Europe and decreased interest in crusading forced European powers to recognize the Ottoman Empire as masters of Anatolia and the Levant.|$|E
5|$|In 1713, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI {{established}} {{a line of}} succession that gave precedence to his own daughters over the daughters of his deceased older brother, Emperor Joseph I. To protect the Habsburg inheritance, he coerced, cajoled, and persuaded the crowned heads of Europe to accept the Pragmatic Sanction. In this agreement, they acknowledged any of his legitimate daughters as <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and Archduchess of Austria – {{a break from the}} tradition of agnatic primogeniture.|$|E

50|$|The {{death of}} Pope John XIV meant that Boniface {{was the only}} {{remaining}} pope, and so he once again took a hold of the papal throne. He still believed himself to be <b>the</b> only <b>rightful</b> pope, and dated back his reign to 974.|$|R
5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking). The funeral ale {{was a way of}} socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E

In the event of the Lebanese Identity Card holder's death, only their children or spouse will benefit from their pension claim.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory of}} Solachon allowed the Byzantines {{to regain the}} upper hand in the region of the Tur Abdin and, in its aftermath, they began to re-establish their control over the region around Dara. The war {{continued}} for a few years without a decision until the revolt of Bahram Chobin caused <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> Persian shah, KhosrauII (r. 590–628), to find refuge in Byzantine territory. A joint expedition restored him to his throne and a peace treaty was concluded in 591 that left most of Armenia in Byzantine hands.|$|E
5000|$|According to some, {{the first}} kaymakam in history was ‘Alī ibn Abī T&#803;ālib, who is {{supposed}} to have been appointed by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, as <b>the</b> first <b>rightful</b> caliph. Thus, ‘Alī was considered to be serving [...] "in the place of" [...] Muhammad.|$|R

50|$|Many, if not all, campus-based debates {{dealing with}} the Palestinian-Israeli {{conflict}} {{have been reduced to}} a simplified choice: either uncompromisingly pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian, with little or no consideration of <b>the</b> competing <b>rightful</b> claims of <b>the</b> other side. As a result, more critical perspectives and dialogue have become virtually impossible.|$|R
5|$|Urged by the Antiochene noblemen, Baldwin III proclaimed Bohemond <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> ruler, {{charging}} Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, {{with the}} administration of the principality during Bohemond's minority. However, Constance appealed to Manuel Komnenos, who confirmed her position as the sole ruler of Antioch. Constance wanted to retain power even after Bohemond reached the age of majority. However, the Antiochene noblemen rebelled against her with the assistance of Thoros II, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, forcing her to leave Antioch in February 1163.|$|E
5|$|A clergyman {{is said to}} have {{informed}} Richard that Edward IV's {{marriage to}} Elizabeth Woodville was invalid because of Edward's earlier union with Eleanor Butler, making Edward V and his siblings illegitimate. The identity of the informant is known only through the memoires of French diplomat Philippe de Commines as Robert Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. On 22 June 1483, a sermon was preached outside Old St. Paul's Cathedral declaring Edward's children bastards and Richard <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> king. Shortly after, the citizens of London, both nobles and commons, convened and drew up a petition asking Richard to assume the throne. He accepted on 26 June and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 July 1483. His title to the throne was confirmed by Parliament in January 1484 by the document Titulus Regius.|$|E
5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> owner.|$|E
5000|$|The Sorcerer's Daughter (2003) is {{a fantasy}} novel by Irina Izmailova, a retelling of the ballet's plot. The boyish and {{careless}} Siegfried consciously prefers the gentle, equally childlike Odile, while the stern and proud Odette {{is from the}} very beginning attracted to Rothbart (who later turns out to be <b>the</b> kingdom's <b>rightful</b> monarch in hiding).|$|R
50|$|According to some, Christianity began {{primarily}} as a pacifist and anarchist movement. Jesus is said, in this view, to have come to empower individuals and free people from an oppressive religious standard in the Mosaic law; he taught that <b>the</b> only <b>rightful</b> authority was God, not Man, evolving the law into the Golden Rule (see also liberal Christianity).|$|R
50|$|In October 2002, Odyssey {{agreed to}} a deal with <b>the</b> ship's <b>rightful</b> owner, <b>the</b> British government, on a formula for sharing any {{potential}} spoils. Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.|$|R
5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down {{the sequence of events}} that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|By 1258, Henry's {{rule was}} {{increasingly}} unpopular, {{the result of}} the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be <b>the</b> <b>rightful</b> ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union {{argued that}} it was <b>the</b> only <b>rightful</b> {{government}} for all of Finland that was capable of ending the Winter War and restoring peace; however, {{before the end of the}} war, the Soviets gave up this interpretation to make peace with the preexisting government of Finland, which was still recognized by the rest of the world.|$|R
5000|$|The {{establishment}} of the church inspired a reactionary movement against it, especially from the Karlovsty Synod. Although the Metropolia severed ties with ROCOR in 1926, the ROCOR still viewed itself as <b>the</b> Metropolia's <b>rightful</b> canonical authority. Aftimios replied forcefully, denouncing the Karlovsty Synod for their actions and forbade his clergy and faithful from having {{anything to do with}} them.|$|R
5000|$|Since the IRA {{called a}} ceasefire, {{splinter}} groups have continued an armed {{campaign against the}} British security forces in Northern Ireland. Like the Provisional IRA, each of these groups sees itself as <b>the</b> only <b>rightful</b> successor of <b>the</b> original IRA and each calls itself simply [...] "the IRA", or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish (see also Irish republican legitimism).|$|R
