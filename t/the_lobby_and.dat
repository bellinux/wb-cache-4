5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E

25|$|Most recently, the {{building}} was refurbished from 2001 to 2002, which also involved remodelling of the three-storey building adjacent to the tower. This involved an upgrade of some floors, <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> the adjoining ANZ Bank branch. The outdoor plaza was also to be revamped {{for the first time}} since {{the building}} was opened in 1976.|$|E

25|$|Dual {{street level}} staircases, rise {{at the east}} and west ends of a stately columned grand hall. The hall itself is about three stories in height, and runs the length of the building; the room {{contains}} the large windows that overlook Kennedy Plaza and the Arcade Building.

25|$|The Hartington City Hall and Auditorium {{includes}} three levels: raised basement partially below grade, main level, and upper level. The basement level and main level are basically rectangular in plan, 75 feet (23 meters) wide (north-south along Broadway) and 130 feet (40 meters) {{front to back}} (east-west along Centre). However, the upper level plan is {{in the shape of}} a cross, so that the four corners are one story lower and function as wings. The two front wings project forward toward Broadway as well as laterally (north and south). The two rear wings are flush with the back (east) of the building. The southeast wing projects south and contains the two fire house doors, but the northeast wing does not project north. The basement originally contained the armory including officers’ quarters, lockers, supply room, and sleeping facilities for fire fighters, with the firehouse in back under the auditorium stage. The main level accommodated <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> city offices in front, the auditorium’s hardwood floor taking up the large middle, and the stage in back above the fire house. The cross-shaped upper level included a small space in front above <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> the stage fly space in back, but the bulk of it in the middle was simply open to the auditorium.|$|E
25|$|At both Eastern and Western {{sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> <b>and</b> at both levels, L-shaped arcaded {{hallways}} {{lead to the}} classrooms. Two semi-enclosed patios are thus defined between the library-auditorium wing (much higher and wider) and the identical classroom wings facing East and West. Three sets of stairs are symmetrically {{laid out in the}} scheme: one of secondary importance at either side of the lobby; the most public one next to side entrances at the L-shaped circulation wings. A third set of stairs faces the patios and is the only one not to connect to the building's basement where more classrooms are found.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other Cirque du Soleil performances, Kà offers four pre-shows. Once {{the house}} opens, guests are {{greeted by the}} villagers of Kà ("Gatekeepers"). Twenty minutes before curtain, two musicians enter <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> climb up to two {{stringed}} instruments specially designed for Kà and integrated into the architecture. Ten minutes before the show, actors appear in the metal framework {{to the left and}} right of the stage and perform flips and leaps assisted with ropes to dive into the audience and attempt to scare viewers. Five minutes before showtime, a staged act informs the audience that there is no flash photography or cell phone usage allowed.|$|E
25|$|There, he {{encountered}} another scene of bedlam, {{this one on}} the stairway from the dress circle, where people were struggling over those who had fallen on the stairs. Fortunately, Vine was now nearer the Washington Street entrance, where Cain and his fellow police officers were slowly reinstating some kind of rough order. He was able to gain <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> helped clear the crush around the stairs. He left the theatre, carrying {{a woman who had}} been trampled underneath and “who seemed as dead as a door nail”. Fire Marshall Keady felt that Vine had been the last person to leave the family circle alive. When he had jumped, there were still many people frantically struggling to leave.|$|E

Refusing to lose, Richman disables the telephone lines and evicts the Muppets from the theater, after the latter fall short of their monetary goal. Kermit gathers the group in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> delivers a speech, suggesting that they will restart their career together as a family. Exiting the theater, the Muppets are greeted by a vast gathering of supporters on Hollywood Boulevard. With Gary's encouragement, Walter greets the crowd and is accepted by the Muppets as their newest member. Gary proposes to Mary, Richman returns the theater and naming rights to the Muppets after suffering a head injury, and Kermit and Piggy enjoy their private life.|$|E

25|$|When Joplin and her back-up band {{performed}} at Vets Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday night, May 11, 1969, Columbus Dispatch reviewer John Huddy wrote: Frequently suggestive {{with a series}} of limited but obvious moves, Miss Joplin wears hip-hugging silk bellbottoms and alternates between a wail and a teeth-rattling scream. Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling coarsely at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also has something to say in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked into <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> watched customers arrive. She was not recognized.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the site}} of the Kennedy-Warren slopes steeply from Connecticut Avenue down to the National Zoo, the lobby level is {{designated}} as the third floor. The two residential levels below that have apartments that face the zoo. Below those are four basement levels, including a large parking garage. The building is an imposing sight on Connecticut Avenue because of its massive size and fine detailing, which includes tan and orange variegated brick, limestone carvings, and the extensive use of aluminum. The Kennedy-Warren was the first building in Washington, D.C., to use aluminum extensively; applications include the entrance porch, spandrels between the windows on the façade, balustrades in <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> <b>and</b> even an aluminum-leaf arched ceiling in the ground-floor corridors, unique in Washington, D.C. The stone carvings are in the Aztec Deco style, influenced by the carved stonework of ancient Mexico, and include griffins, eagles, and a frieze of elephants and starbursts and they rise three floors above street level.|$|E

25|$|Roberts was a {{real estate}} {{salesperson}} in 1964 when Abe Hirschfeld hired her to sit in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> sell at 925 Park Avenue in New York. She was a condominium broker in 1968 when she met and began her involvement with the then-married multi-millionaire real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. In 1970, she joined one of Helmsley's brokerage firms—Brown, Harris, Stevens—as a senior vice-president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Helmsley divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. Roberts's marriage to Helmsley may well have saved her career. Late in 1971, several of her tenants sued her for forcing the tenants {{of one of the}} apartments she managed to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Helmsley's growing hotel empire.|$|E
25|$|Equitable {{sold the}} {{building}} in 1946 to the Flatiron Associates, an investor group headed by Harry Helmsley, whose firm, Dwight-Helmsley (which would later become Helmsley-Spear) managed the property. The new owners made some superficial changes, such as adding a dropped ceiling to <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> <b>and,</b> later, replacing the original mahogony-panelled entrances with revolving doors. Because the ownership structure was a tenancy-in-common, in which all partners have to agree on any action, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward partnership, it was difficult to get permission for necessary repairs and improvements to be done, and the building declined during the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates era. Helmsley-Spear stopped managing {{the building in}} 1997, when some of the investors sold their 52% of the building to Newmark Knight-Frank, a large real estate firm, which took over management of the property. Shortly afterwards, Helmsley's widow, Leona Helmsley, sold her share as well. Newmark made significant improvements to the property, including installing new electric elevators, replacing the antiquated hydraulic ones.|$|E
