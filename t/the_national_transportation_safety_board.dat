5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to {{loss of power}} in the left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E

Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport pilot certificate, meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) was legally required to investigate.

50|$|A {{final report}} by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Committee (NTSC) {{concluded}} that the crash was due to Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) resulting from pilot error. The Captain ignored the ground proximity warning after the First Officer had warned him many times as he became anxious about how the Captain was handling the aircraft.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{analysis}} {{determined that}} Flight370's last location was within Australia's Search and Rescue {{region in the}} southern Indian Ocean, Australia has {{played a major role}} in co-ordinating the analysis in conjunction with Malaysia. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is responsible for the search for Flight370 and has brought together a team of experts to determine the location of Flight370 at the 08:19 communication. The team brought together by the ATSB includes the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (Australia), Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, Inmarsat, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (US), and Thales.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station.
