5|$|On October29, Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards {{requested}} that the state's congressional delegation ask President Ronald Reagan for a disaster declaration. President Reagan responded and issued a disaster declaration on November1, which included the parishes of Ascension, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, Saint Charles, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Terrebonne, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward</b> of New Orleans. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development estimated that highways in the state would require $3 million in repairs from damage wrought by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward,</b> between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the great}} devastation and lack of {{population}} and services, <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward</b> was the last area of the city still under a curfew half {{a year after the}} disaster. Officially, residents were allowed in during daylight hours to look, salvage possessions, and leave, although some few had already done extensive work gutting and repairing their damaged homes in preparation to move back. By January 2006, the widespread damages and difficulties in restoring basic utilities and city services still prevented the official reopening of the Lower 9th Ward to residents who wished to return to live.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, Build Now, a local, {{non-profit}} homebuilder, began working to bring New Orleans families back home.

500|$|McIlrath was {{inspired}} to write the lyrics for the song following a trip he took to New Orleans. While he had initially gone to discuss with local musicians how to merge politics and music, {{he was able to}} visit several areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood, such as <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward.</b> As McIlrath had felt that news outlets were quick to discuss less important stories following the disaster, he compiled his thoughts and wrote the song's lyrics. McIlrath also noted that his criticism of the United States government's handling of various disasters influenced the lyrics; he called Hurricane Katrina [...] "as much a man-made disaster as it was a natural disaster", and lambasted the fact that no legislation was passed to prevent another oil spill following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Lower Ninth Ward is a {{neighborhood}} {{of the city of}} New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. [...] As the name implies, {{it is part of the}} Ninth Ward of New Orleans.

5000|$|To date, the {{majority}} of Misrach's large-format documentary images of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast taken immediately after Hurricane Katrina have not been shown, {{with the exception of}} Destroy this Memory, a book published five years after the disaster, consisting entirely of pocket-camera pictures of messages left on houses, cars, and trees by survivors of the hurricane. A Los Angeles Times review called the book [...] "a raw testament, shot between October and December 2005, just after the waters began to recede but the emotions had certainly not. Without captions or a contextual introduction to detract from the potency of the photographs themselves, the book is a powerful document allowing survivors to speak eloquently for themselves — even in absentia." [...] Proceeds from Destroy this Memory were donated to the Make It Right Foundation to help rebuild <b>the</b> city's <b>Lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward.</b> Complete sets of the photographs were also donated to five museums—the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.|$|R
25|$|The {{storm surge}} over topped levees along the channel and {{on both sides}} of its {{terminus}} at the Industrial Canal in the <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward.</b> There may have also been a breach of the Back Protection levee along Florida Avenue. The flooding covered areas of Gentilly and both <b>the</b> upper and <b>lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Ward</b> of New Orleans. The flooding spread to the east and inundated most of Arabi (except for areas of high ground near the river.) In Arabi, Betsy began to die down around 3am. Many residents, thinking the worst had passed, went to sleep around this time. The flooding reached Arabi Park around 4am waking the exhausted survivors to another phase of the disaster. Between 4am and 6am, the water rose between six and eight feet. By dawn, the water was making its way across the railroad grade between Arabi Park and Carolyn Park and flowing into Chalmette.|$|R
5000|$|Common Ground Health Clinic had its {{beginnings}} when four young street medics arrived in Algiers {{a few days}} after the hurricane. They began riding around on bicycles asking residents if they needed medical attention. Locals were surprised to be approached in this way, since no representatives of government agencies or of the Red Cross had appeared up to that point. The medics offered first aid, took blood pressure, tested for diabetes, and asked about symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other disease.Common Ground volunteers helped to provide free services and home gutting in <b>the</b> Upper & <b>Lower</b> <b>Ninth</b> <b>Wards.</b> As of March 1, 2009, over 23,000 people had volunteered with Common Ground Relief for various lengths of time, creating an unusual social situation in the predominantly black neighborhoods, since most of the volunteers were young white people from throughout the United States and Europe. [...] An ABC News Nightline report described the volunteers as [...] "mostly young people filled with energy and idealism, and untainted by cynicism and despair, and mostly white, who have come from across America and from countries as far away as Indonesia." [...] The health clinic was especially helpful to remaining residents of New Orleans immediately after the hurricane since Charity Hospital and other emergency care providers were not available.|$|R
