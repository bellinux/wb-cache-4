5|$|The {{significance}} of Ahimsa {{as the very}} first restraint {{in the very first}} limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> purified in thought, word and deed through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. <b>The</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E

In recent years the New Age faith has encouraged the idea of <b>the</b> Higher <b>Self</b> in contemporary culture, though the notion of <b>the</b> Higher <b>Self</b> has <b>been</b> interpreted throughout numerous historical spiritual faiths. Some denominations believe that <b>the</b> higher <b>self</b> <b>is</b> a part of an individual's metaphysical identity, while others teach that <b>the</b> higher <b>self</b> <b>is</b> essentially our tie to the heavens.

The results of our experiment support these hypotheses. Participants made outcome-biased judgments about <b>the</b> <b>self</b> for positive outcomes but not for negative ones, whereas they were equally outcome-biased in their trait judgments about another target for both positive and negative outcomes. Moreover, the more peripheral the trait dimension implied by the outcome, the stronger the outcome-biased self-judgment.

25|$|In the Theravada tradition, {{suffering}} {{arises when}} one identifies with or {{clings to the}} aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates.

25|$|In pre-modern and {{traditional}} Hindu religions, Yoga and Dhyana are done to realize union of one's eternal self or soul, one's ātman. In some Hindu traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta this is equated with the omnipresent and non-dual Brahman. In others, {{such as the}} dualistic the Yoga school and Samkhya, <b>the</b> <b>Self</b> <b>is</b> referred to as Purusha, a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event {{is referred to as}} moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> {{found to}} be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

2500|$|According to Horney we {{can have}} two views of our self: the [...] "real self" [...] and the [...] "ideal self". <b>The</b> real <b>self</b> <b>is</b> who and what we {{actually}} <b>are.</b> [...] <b>The</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> type of person {{we feel that we}} should <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> real <b>self</b> has <b>the</b> potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. <b>The</b> ideal <b>self</b> <b>is</b> used as a model to assist <b>the</b> real <b>self</b> in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization.

25|$|In part two, Unger {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; {{we want to see}} the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.|$|E
500|$|While the hymns of the Vedas {{emphasize}} {{rituals and}} the Brahmanas {{serve as a}} liturgical manual for those Vedic rituals, {{the spirit of the}} Upanishads is inherently opposed to ritual.

500|$|Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control is a 2004 popular science book {{explaining}} [...] mind control, {{which is}} also known as brainwashing, thought reform and coercive persuasion, by neuroscientist and physiologist Kathleen Taylor.

It reviews case studies including Patty Hearst, the Manson Family, and the mass murder/suicide of members of Peoples Temple at Jonestown, and compares the techniques of influence used by cults to those of totalitarian and communist societies. It lays out a model FACET - Freedom, Agency, Complexity, Ends-not-means, and Thinking - which she believes can be used to negate the influence of brainwashing techniques.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{integrity}} of personhood {{refers to the}} wholeness or intactness of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> in all its diverse aspects. Life threatening illness can compromise the intactness of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> in many ways, four of which are examined here; the resultant suffering {{can be understood as}} spiritual pain, since spirituality and the integration of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>are</b> closely connected. <b>The</b> needs of persons faced with the threat of dis-integration of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>are</b> examined, and it is suggested that such needs may be best met by carers in four ways:- by Seeing, Listening, Loving, Respecting the Mystery. To do this requires not so much professional expertise as a way of being, a quality of presence which depends upon who we really are, as persons...|$|R

50|$|For James, <b>the</b> spiritual <b>self</b> <b>was</b> {{who we are}} at our core. <b>The</b> spiritual <b>self</b> <b>is</b> more {{concrete}} or permanent than <b>the</b> other two <b>selves.</b> <b>The</b> spiritual <b>self</b> <b>is</b> our subjective and most intimate self. Aspects of an individual's spiritual self include things like their personality, core values, and conscience that do not typically change throughout their lifetime. <b>The</b> spiritual <b>self</b> involves introspection, or looking inward to deeper spiritual, moral, or intellectual questions without the influence of objective thoughts. For James, achieving {{a high level of}} understanding of who we are at our core, or understanding our spiritual <b>selves</b> <b>is</b> more rewarding than satisfying the needs of the social and material selves.|$|R
500|$|The {{philosophy}} of mind also has important {{consequences for the}} concept of self. If by [...] "self" [...] or [...] "I" [...] one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the person, some modern philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> considered an illusion. The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives {{from the idea of}} an immaterial soul. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of [...] "self" [...] as postulated by David Hume, who could never catch himself not doing, thinking or feeling anything. However, in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology, developmental biology and neuroscience, the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.|$|E
500|$|His {{transcendental}} signature style {{first came}} into full expression with his 1968 classic, Astral Weeks and he was noted to have remained a [...] "master of his transcendental craft" [...] in 2009 while performing the Astral Weeks songs live. This musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with LA Weekly wrote [...] "he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known." [...] Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison's music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: [...] "But in his music {{the same sense of}} escape from ordinary limits – a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence – can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>is</b> left behind, and the sound, that [...] "yarragh," [...] becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body." [...] A book reviewer further described it as [...] "This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life..." ...|$|E
