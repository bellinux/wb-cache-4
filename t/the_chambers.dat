5|$|At {{the south}} end of {{corridor}} lies an antechamber, which is located directly under the tip of the pyramid. The antechamber is oriented on the east–west axis and leads west to the king's burial chamber. The burial chamber has the same height and width as the antechamber, but is longer. At the western end of the burial chamber Perring discovered some fragments of an empty and undercorated black basalt sarcophagus which had been originally placed in a slight depression as well as a canopic chest. <b>The</b> <b>chambers</b> are protected from the pyramid weight by a gabled ceiling made of two large Tura limestone blocks, an architecture common to all pyramids of the 5th and 6th dynasties. <b>The</b> <b>chambers</b> are lined with the same material, while the floor pavement was lost to stone robbers.|$|E

50|$|The Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Counties (Predsjednik Županijskog doma Hrvatskog sabora, {{literally}} the President of <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Counties of the Croatian Parliament) was the presiding officer of <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Counties, <b>the</b> upper <b>chamber</b> of <b>the</b> Croatian Parliament from 22 March 1993 until its abolition by constitution changes on 28 March 2001. The Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Counties {{was elected by}} a majority of <b>the</b> <b>chamber's</b> members for <b>the</b> duration of the parliamentary term. In the event of a dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> <b>the</b> speaker would continue to serve until the inauguration of his or her successor. Only two individuals held the office of Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Counties during its eight-year existence: Josip Manolić (1993-1994) and Katica Ivanišević (1994-2001). Katica Ivanišević remains the only woman to have served as Speaker of either chamber of Croatian Parliament. The office became defunct upon the passing of constitutional amendments by which <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Counties was abolished and the bicameral Croatian Parliament was replaced by a unicameral parliamentary system. <b>The</b> lower <b>chamber,</b> formally known as <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Representatives (Croatian: Zastupnički dom) thus became <b>the</b> only parliamentary <b>chamber</b> and became known simply as the Croatian Parliament.|$|R

5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. <b>The</b> <b>chambers</b> became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b> Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the younger and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit. He was suffering from tuberculosis, and he returned to Ulverston for six months to recover. During his time in Birmingham, he continued his work as a minister, regularly preaching at the Baptist People's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E

50|$|A {{resonance}} chamber uses resonance {{to amplify}} sound. <b>The</b> <b>chamber</b> has interior surfaces which reflect an acoustic wave. When a wave enters <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> it bounces {{back and forth}} within <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> with low loss (See standing wave). As more wave energy enters <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> it combines with and reinforces the standing wave, increasing its intensity.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E

40|$|An object {{within a}} chamber is acoustically moved by {{applying}} wavelengths of different modes to <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> to move <b>the</b> object between pressure wells {{formed by the}} modes. In one system, the object is placed in one end of <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> while a resonant mode, applied {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> produces a pressure well at the location. The frequency is then switched to a second mode that produces a pressure well at the center of <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> to draw <b>the</b> object. When the object reaches the second pressure well and is still traveling towards the second end of <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> <b>the</b> acoustic frequency is again shifted to a third mode (which may equal the first model) that has a pressure well in the second end portion of <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> to draw <b>the</b> object.
