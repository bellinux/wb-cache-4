5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>work</b> for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E

The process of reform was incremental. New measures were first introduced experimentally in a few localities and then were popularized and disseminated nationally if they proved successful. By 1987 the program had achieved remarkable results in increasing supplies of food and other consumer goods and had created a new climate of dynamism and opportunity in the economy. At the same time, however, the reforms also had created new problems and tensions, leading to intense questioning and political struggles over the program's future.|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, it is {{completely}} accepted that human resource is the main element in knowledge management productivity (Zahedi and Tejari 2008). Many empirical research results have showed that KM have great influence on organizational outcomes in terms of innovation, product quality, and improvement of employees morale (Alzoubi and Alnajjar 2010; Sireteanu and Grigoruta 2007; Pentland 2003). Creation of a favorable work environment and securing high levels of trust among employees and employer-employee relationships are crucial factors in knowledge sharing (Kurtoğlu 2007). In order to avoid losing the qualified employees or to minimize prospective loss of leaving employees organizations must transform the individual knowledge possessed by the employees into organizational knowledge. Rendering organizational commitment among employees {{is one of the}} most important ways. Alzoubi and Alnajjar (2010) studied KM architecture tsted a set of variables related to Knowledge management revealed that the pillars of knowledge management architecture consist of strategy and commitment, information systems, culture, and communication.
