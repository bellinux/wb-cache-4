5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to <b>the</b> <b>how</b> small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

5|$|Edward sent assurances to the Pope {{that the}} {{conflict}} surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On {{the basis of these}} promises, and procedural concerns about <b>the</b> <b>how</b> the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the yearly}} {{changes in the}} route, race length, and number of stages, the biggest change to <b>the</b> <b>how</b> the general {{classification}} was to be calculated. The organizers chose to make the general classification centered around teams rather than individuals like the race was contested {{in the first three}} years of its existence. They chose to only allow teams of four riders to compete in the race, making this the first Giro d'Italia to not contain any independent riders. Each team was required to have three riders finish each stage in order to remain in the race. The general classification was still determined by a point system: four points went to the team that the stage winner came from, if a team got two riders in the top four placings on a stage they got two points, and if a team completed the stage with the minimum three riders, they earned one point.|$|E
5|$|Robert Cook wrote Gumball for {{publication}} by Broderbund in 1983. Broderbund {{had a reputation}} as a successful publisher. Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's output, and their software in both categories reached the top of sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept of a machine that sorts based on color, and Robert Cook expanded the concept with the gumball conceit. He spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though he later returned to add more background detail, his original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as <b>the</b> <b>how</b> individual gumballs move through the pipes.|$|E

25|$|When {{protecting}} the coastline {{it is important}} to understand <b>the</b> <b>how</b> the sedimentary budget can be affected when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ engineering structures as a means of {{protecting the}} coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches but at the same time starving down drift beaches. This management approach is not used so much these days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes.|$|E
25|$|During 1966 and 1967 {{it became}} obvious to MACV that the North Vietnamese were using neutral Cambodia {{as a part of}} their {{logistical}} system, funneling men and supplies to the southernmost seat of battle. The unknown factor was <b>the</b> <b>how</b> much use the enemy was making of Cambodia. The answer shocked even the most hardened intelligence analysts. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, desperately trying to balance the threats facing his nation, had allowed Hanoi to set up a presence in Cambodia. Although the extension of Laotian Highway 110 into Cambodia in the tri-border region was an improvement to its logistical system, North Vietnam was now unloading communist-flagged transports in the port of Sihanoukville and simply trucking its supplies to its Base Areas on the eastern border.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand <b>the</b> <b>how</b> their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions.|$|E
