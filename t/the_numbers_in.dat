5|$|Irish legislators {{began to}} comment {{publicly}} from 2003, some tentatively suggesting legislation, and some referring to Catholic teachings. Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition as inevitable and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} the {{unconscious}} tendency {{of people to}} prefer <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{fossil record}} {{dates back to}} nearly 0.7 million years ago. Fossils of the red hartebeest {{have been found in}} Elandsfontein, Cornelia (Free State) and Florisbad in South Africa, as well as in Kabwe in Zambia. In Israel, hartebeest remains have been found in northern Negev, Shephelah, Sharon Plain and Tel Lachish. This population of the hartebeest was originally limited to the open country of the southernmost regions of the southern Levant. It was probably hunted in Egypt, which affected <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the Levant, and disconnected it from its main population in Africa.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{is named after}} James Joseph Sylvester, who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially, and {{the sum of its}} reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with the same number of terms. The recurrence by which it is defined allows <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian Einstein manifolds, and hard instances for online algorithms.|$|E
5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of blue {{wildebeest}} {{is estimated to be}} around 1,550,000. The population trend overall is stable and <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) have increased to about 1,300,000. The population density ranges from 0.15/km2 in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park where they are most plentiful. Blue wildebeest have also been introduced into a number of private game farms, reserves and conservancy areas. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern. However, the numbers of the eastern white-bearded wildebeest (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline in numbers to a current level of probably 6,000 to 8,000 animals and this is causing some concern.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{period in}} the cabinet, Heffron {{was seen as a}} {{prominent}} and well-performing member of the government, and as such a potential contender for the premiership. The first opportunity for Heffron came in February 1946, when McKell announced to the Labor caucus of his intention to resign before the 1947 election. McKell, with the intention of ensuring Heffron as his successor, remained as an MP even after Prime Minister Joseph Chifley had announced his appointment as Governor-General in order to vote for Heffron. At the ballot on 5 February 1947, Heffron lost by two votes to the Minister for Housing, James McGirr, who was favoured by the more Catholic and conservative caucus members. When McGirr announced his resignation on the grounds of ill health on 1 April 1952, Heffron put himself forward as a candidate to succeed him against, among others, Deputy Premier Joseph Cahill. However, the day before the ballot on 3 April, Heffron had been made aware that he would not have <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> caucus to win against Cahill and consequently made arrangements with Cahill to give the votes of his bloc to Cahill, in exchange for his support to become Deputy Premier. As a result, on 3 April Cahill defeated Attorney General Clarrie Martin 32 votes to 14 to become Premier and Heffron defeated Mines Secretary Joshua Arthur 32 votes to 14 to become Deputy Premier.|$|E
