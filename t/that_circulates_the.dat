5000|$|Also {{known as}} the Limestone Castle, the {{limestone}} came from Mr. Norton's quarry. He enjoyed {{a large amount of}} success due to the limestone in his quarry having a light blue hue to it. Over the last 40 years, not much has changed about the property. One large evergreen tree was taken down that was located {{at the beginning of the}} driveway. The only visible improvements or updating that has been done in that time is the carpet (unknown date) and the tar shingle roof in 1983. The fencing around the rear of the property was built by a family who rented the home from 1982 to 1984. The front limestone facade at the sidewalk has been repaired to keep it from toppling over. The red building at the rear of the property was living quarters for the builders. It still has a wood burning stove inside and is a two-story building with stairs. There is a full size attic with interior stairs for access. The basement covers about 3/4 of the house. The home is heated by a boiler in the basement <b>that</b> <b>circulates</b> <b>the</b> hot water through radiators throughout the home. There is still an intercom system to all of the upstairs bedroom from the kitchen. There is a laundry chute from the second story to the laundry/pantry room.

40|$|International audienceThe {{short-time}} scale {{evolution of}} plankton carbon partitioning and downward flux of the modified Black Sea Water (BSW) mass entering the northeast Aegean Sea was studied using a Lagrangian approach (6 - 10 / 04 / 2008). The free-drifting sediment trap positioned {{at the bottom}} of the BSW layer and the control drifter, followed the same path within the anticyclone <b>that</b> <b>circulates</b> <b>the</b> BSW in the area. Ζooplankton biomass increased (from 159 to 292 mg C m- 2), as did faecal pellet production (from 5 to 8 mg C m- 2 day- 1), whereas a rather decreasing trend was displayed by POC (from 2099 to 1440 mg C m- 2), net primary production and biomass of plankton cells > 5 μm (from 32 to 11 mg C m- 2 day- 1 and from 153 to 124 mg C m- 2, respectively). On the same time, the organic carbon flux increased (from 131 to 311 mg C m- 2 day- 1), due to the contribution of zooplankton detritus (from 30 to 165 mg C m- 2 day- 1). Normalized biomass-size spectra (NB-S) slopes suggested an elevated grazing pressure upon microplankton cells and a non-steady state ecosystem. Moreover, both the overall shallow slope values and their high correlation to organic carbon flux indicated an increased efficiency of energy transfer to higher trophic levels...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{an optical}} light {{curve of the}} {{symbiotic}} system AG Draconis covering the last 120 years of its history. During the first 32 years the system was in a quiescence state. Around the year 1922 the star's quiescence luminosity brightened by 0. 29 mag. The last 82 years of the light curve (LC) are characterized {{by a series of}} outbursts of 1 - 2 magnitude in brightness and about 100 days in duration. The outbursts are distributed along the time axis in 6 clusters with a quasi-periodic cycle of some 5300 days. The time intervals among the outbursts themselves are integral numbers of the period 373. 5 days. During quiescence states the LC oscillates with the binary period of the system of 550 d. The LC contains also a weak periodic signal with a period of 350 d, attributed to pulsations of the giant star. Another period of 1160 d is also present in the light curve, being the sidereal rotation period of the giant star. We suggest that the outbursts are events of intense mass transfer from the giant onto the hot component. These are modulated by an interplay between a solar-like magnetic dynamo cycle operating in the outer layers of the giant, and a tidal deformation of these layers <b>that</b> <b>circulates</b> <b>the</b> surface of the giant with the synodic diurnal period of 373. 5 Earth days. AG Dra is the 5 th symbiotic system with a light curve that reflects such an intense magnetic and magnetically modulated activity. (Abridged) Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Virtually every {{virus and}} worm <b>that</b> <b>circulates</b> <b>the</b> Internet today is ""protected"" by {{some form of}} {{obfuscation}} that hides the code's true intent. In the Window's world where worms prevail, the use of tools such as UPX, ASPack, and teLock has become standard. Protection of malicious code {{is not the only}} goal of binary obfuscators however which can be used to protect intellectual property. In the Linux world, tools such as Burneye and Shiva exist which can be used in ways similar to any Window's obfuscation tool. To fight such methods, analysts have created specific tools or techniques for unraveling these code obfuscators in order to reveal the software within. To date, in the fight against malware, anti-virus vendors have had the luxury of focusing on signature development since obfuscation of malware has presented little challenge. To combat this, malware authors are rapidly morphing their code in order to evade quickly developed and deployed signature-matching routines. What will happen when malware authors begin to morph their obfuscation techniques as rapidly as they morph their worms? While not designed specifically as a malware protection tool, one program, Shiva, aims to do exactly that. Shiva forces analysis of malicious code to be delayed while analysts fight through each novel mutation of Shiva's obfuscation mechanism. This, in effect, provides the malware {{a longer period of time}} to wreak havoc before countermeasures can be developed. This talk will focus on the use of emulated execution within IDA Pro to provide a generic means for rapidly deobfuscating protected code. Capabilities of the emulation engine will be discussed and the removal of several types of obfuscation will be demonstrated. Finally, the development of standalone deobfuscation tools based on the emulation engine will be discussed.

40|$|In this thesis, {{variations}} in efficiency between two different solar collectors have been measured. Solar collector efficiency has been measured {{at different levels}} of flow. In addition, there has been made calculations of heat gained by the solar system {{in the course of a}} day. The effect of reduced transmission at an increasing angle of incidence, has been discussed. Comparisons of the two models show a minor improvement in efficiency in the latest solar collector models. Comparing daily energy gain for the system show the similar result. The difference is seen most clearly when considering efficiency per. A solar heating system consists of a solar collector, a heat store and a heat distribution system. The system examined in this thesis, has water as a heat carrier medium, and a pump <b>that</b> <b>circulates</b> <b>the</b> water through the solar collectors. The essential elements of a solar collector are the collector plate which can transfer energy from the sun to the water, and a cover sheet. The latter’s function is to prevent heat loss from the collector plate, and as such it makes the solar collectors function as a green house. Efficiency is an indicator of how well the solar collector, eventually the entire system, manages to exploit solar energy. In the thesis, efficiency has been analysed using a calorimetric method. Here the large storage tank holding almost 500 litres is used as a calorimeter. An easy way of measuring efficiency is looking at the increase in temperature in the heat store, and total radiation in the course of one day. Studies of the new solar collectors show that as much as 50 % of the energy received by the solar collectors in the course of a day is useful energy. The flow rate tells us how fast the water flows through the collector plates. The water absorbes energy from the collector plates, which are heated by the sun. In the experiments, three types of flow were chosen manually. The flow rates were between 0. 85 and 2. 0. Comparing data from both models show no significant difference in efficiency by changing the flow rate. The efficiency is apparently not affected by variations of flow rate in the solar collectors...|$|E
40|$|The Pool Water Treatment and Cooling System {{is located}} in the Waste Handling Building (WHB), and is {{comprised}} of various process subsystems designed to support waste handling operations. This system maintains the pool water temperature within an acceptable range, maintains water quality standards that support remote underwater operations and prevent corrosion, detects leakage from the pool liner, provides the capability to remove debris from the pool, controls the pool water level, and helps limit radiological exposure to personnel. The pool structure and liner, pool lighting, and the fuel staging racks in the pool are not within the scope of the Pool Water Treatment and Cooling System. Pool water temperature control is accomplished by circulating the pool water through heat exchangers. Adequate circulation and mixing of the pool water is provided to prevent localized thermal hotspots in the pool. Treatment of the pool water is accomplished by a water treatment system <b>that</b> <b>circulates</b> <b>the</b> pool water through filters, and ion exchange units. These water treatment units remove radioactive and non-radioactive particulate and dissolved solids from the water, thereby providing the water clarity needed to conduct waste handling operations. The system also controls pool water chemistry to prevent advanced corrosion of the pool liner, pool components, and fuel assemblies. Removal of radioactivity from the pool water contributes to the project ALARA (as low as is reasonably achievable) goals. A leak detection system is provided to detect and alarm leaks through the pool liner. The pool level control system monitors the water level to ensure that the minimum water level required for adequate radiological shielding is maintained. Through interface with a demineralized water system, adequate makeup is provided to compensate for loss of water inventory through evaporation and waste handling operations. Interface with the Site Radiological Monitoring System provides continuous radiological monitoring of the pool water. The Pool Water Treatment and Cooling System interfaces with the Waste Handling Building System, Site-Generated Radiological Waste Handling System, Site Radiological Monitoring System, Waste Handling Building Electrical System, Site Water System, and the Monitored Geologic Repository Operations Monitoring and Control System...|$|E
