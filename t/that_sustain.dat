5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

25|$|Postcolonialism or postcolonial {{studies is}} an {{academic}} discipline that analyzes, explains, and {{responds to the}} cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Postcolonialism speaks about the human consequences of external control and economic exploitation of native people and their lands. Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyze the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by examining the functional relations {{of social and political}} power <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> colonialism and neocolonialism—the imperial regime's depictions (social, political, cultural) of the colonizer and of the colonized.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration of auroral charged {{particles}} invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which {{is believed to}} predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle {{in the direction of}} the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable {{by changes in}} the number and identity of the halogen atoms. In general they are volatile, but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the halides, which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at −161°C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between −51.7 (CF2H2) and −128°C (CF4). The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. The CFCs are far less flammable than methane, {{in part because they}} contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because, {{in the case of the}} chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> flames.|$|E

The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system. A simplified tax system with flat rates and low indirect taxation, openness to foreign investment, and a liberal trade regime have supported the resilient and well-functioning economy. The 2017 Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 12th in the world, surpassing neighbouring Finland, Australia, Germany, Canada and Switzerland. The strong focus on the IT sector has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet. Estonia has the third lowest business bribery risk in the world, according to TRACE Matrix.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle ground}} between the craft {{production}} of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and knowledge transfer, which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer {{their way out of}} their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on employment and employability is an externality.|$|E

2500|$|Additional {{controversy}} followed Nichol after {{allowing the}} Sex Workers' Art Show {{to proceed to}} campus on February 4, 2008. The tour visits college campuses and other venues across the country. While personally expressing his displeasure with {{the content of the}} student-funded show, Nichol felt censoring the performance would be inappropriate. He issued a statement saying, [...] "The First Amendment and the defining traditions of openness <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> universities are hallmarks of academic inquiry and freedom. It is the speech we disdain that often puts these principles to the test. The College of William & Mary will not knowingly and intentionally violate the constitutional rights of its students. Censorship has no place at a great university." [...] Nichol's allowance of the Sex Workers' Art Show to perform on the campus garnered mixed reactions among both the general public and the College student body.|$|E
2500|$|In {{trying to}} assess the legacy of colonization, some {{researchers}} {{have focused on the}} type of political and economic institutions that existed before the arrival of Europeans. Heldring and Robinson conclude that while colonization in Africa had unequivocal negative consequences for political and economic development in areas that had previous centralized institutions or that hosted white settlements, it possibly had a positive impact in areas that were virtually stateless, like South Sudan or Somalia. In a complementary analysis, Gerner Hariri observed that areas outside Europe which had State-like institutions before 1500 tend to have less open political systems today. According to the scholar, {{this is due to the}} fact that during the colonization, European liberal institutions were not easily implemented. [...] Beyond the military and political advantages, it is possible to explain the domination of European countries over non-European areas by the fact that capitalism did not emerge as the dominant economic institution elsewhere. As Ugo Pipitone argues, prosperous economic institutions <b>that</b> <b>sustain</b> growth and innovation did not prevail in areas like China, the Arab world, or Mesoamerica because of the excessive control of these proto-States on private matters.|$|E
