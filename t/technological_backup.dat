It can shoot bolts from its eyes, shoot tear gas from its hands, create energy fields to protect its interior and exterior, fire tentacles from its palms, and regenerate.

50|$|The {{university}} has specialization in providing higher education {{specifically in the}} fields of Agriculture, Forestry, Horticulture, Veterinary and Fisheries. It aims to provide higher education to people and to impart technical knowledge in them.Navsari Agricultural university Commencing with a college of agriculture established in 1965 on a sprawling farm land of 400 hectares located on the historic road of Dandi March around 3 km from Navsari railway station and 8 km from the National Highway No. 8, the Navsari campus gained the status of a separate agricultural university with effect from May 1, 2004. The university caters {{to the needs of the}} farmers of the plantation crops in the heartland of Gujarat; the Kanam zone of cotton, sorghum and pigeon pea and hill millets of tribal belt. Besides the above, this area is also well known for its forest tree species like teak, Khair, Kalam and bamboo. To provide <b>technological</b> <b>backup</b> for the agricultural development in its domain (Map of Districts Covered) the Navsari Agricultural University has four fully developed faculties of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and Veterinary, 2 Zonal Research Stations (Navsari and Bharuch), three main crop based research station (cotton, sorghum and mango), 3 regional research station (Waghai, Vyara and Gandevi) and 6 verification/testing centers. The extension component includes three Krushi Vigyan Kendras (Waghai, Vyara and Navsari), one Sardar Smruti Kendra (Navsari), and a T & V scheme. This university also offers vocational courses in horticulture at Navsari, home science at Vyara, agriculture at Waghai and Bharuch as well as Livestock Management, Bakery and Mali and extension education trainings at Navsari.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{investigation}} of the land conservation strategies adopted by farmers to control land degradation around Mt. Elgon National Park, Uganda. Primary data were obtained through household survey conducted in Mutushet and Kortek parishes, Kapc. horwa district between June to December, 2003. The differences between adopters and non-adopters of land conservation practices in terms of contact with extension workers, tribe, size of productive family labour, membership to farmer organization, education level, and participation in communal land management activities and frequency of natural hazards on private agricultural landfj were examined Farmers have increasingly adopted different structural measures like terraced farming, construction of waterways, check dams, retention walls, and gull control. Similarly, they have also adopted different biological measures including alley cropping, bamboo plantation in gullies, mulching and applied organic and inorganic fertilizers to control land degradation. However, farmers have not been able to control land degradation to a great extent due to relatively weak <b>technological</b> <b>backup</b> by concerned agencies. It was concluded that severity of land degradation is higher in the parishes with traditional farming methods because farmers are not provided with the necessary technical advisory services...|$|E
50|$|Most {{investors who}} use an online broker {{or even a}} regular full-service broker will have their shares held in {{book-entry}} form. This is generally convenient, as {{one does not have}} to preserve physical stock certificates, and can buy/sell securities without turning certificates in or having new ones issued. Also, replacement costs for certificates are high in case one loses them, while book-entry ownership can never be lost thanks to <b>technological</b> <b>backups.</b>|$|R
