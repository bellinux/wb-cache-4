It has a {{displacement}} of 910 tons, a length of , a beam of [...] and a specially reinforced bow and hull for sailing through ice. Óðinn proved a particularly good rescue vessel and it patrolled Iceland's territorial fishing grounds, monitoring both Icelandic and foreign vessels. Óðinn took part in the three Cod Wars where the most effective and famous weapon was the <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> cutter, which is displayed on the afterdeck.

40|$|Trawl {{activity}} on the continental shelf break off South Africa provides large quantities of food {{in the form of}} discards for a range of species, including non-breeding black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys and white-capped albatrosses T. steadi. As large numbers of both species are killed in collisions with <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> cables, mitigation measures have been introduced that include limitation of discards, yet {{little is known about the}} consequences of reduced food supply for scavenging birds. We tracked adult and immature albatrosses in the southern Benguela in the austral winters of 2005 and 2006 and examined their distribution in relation to fisheries, bathymetry and remotely sensed oceanography. Kernel analysis revealed that white-capped albatrosses spent most (85. 0...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Seabird bycatch in {{commercial}} fisheries {{is one of}} the major factors causing decreases in many seabird populations. In trawl fisheries, high mortalities have been recorded as a result of seabirds being struck by <b>trawl</b> <b>warps</b> (the cables used to tow the trawl net). Tori (bird-scaring) lines have been used to decrease seabird mortality in some trawl fisheries by up to 90 %. However, tori lines are not effective at reducing the number of birds that drift towards the <b>trawl</b> <b>warps</b> while feeding on factory discards alongside the vessel. The Albatross Task Force (ATF) helped to develop and test a new device, the Rory Line (RL), to be used in conjunction with tori lines, and designed to reduce warp strikes by placing a physical barrier between the scupper (where factory discards are released) and the danger zone (where the <b>trawl</b> <b>warps</b> enter the water) at the stern of the vessel. This study tests the efficacy of the RL at reducing the number of birds drifting into the danger zone and the number of birds being struck by the <b>trawl</b> <b>warps...</b>|$|R

25|$|Side {{trawlers}} – {{have the}} trawl set {{over the side}} with the <b>trawl</b> <b>warps</b> passing through blocks which hang from two gallows, one forward and one aft. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most familiar vessel in the North Atlantic deep sea fisheries. They evolved {{over a longer period}} than other trawler types, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers.|$|R
40|$|C The NEFSC should {{continue}} to use the trawl survey data for New England groundfish stock assessment unadjusted, because such use is scientifically justifiable. Payne Summary Point 1, page 3 C There {{appears to be no}} systematic change in trawl survey performance in the period covered by the offset trawl warps. Bell, page 2 C Conversion coefficients, for use in assessments, should be determined for stocks for which the catch results from optimal and suboptimal gear settings differed most Payne Summary Point 5, page 4 C However, given that there is no consistent differences between the “optimal ” and “worst case ” trawls (i. e. some positive, some negative), there are no grounds for modifying the survey results except for those where significant changes were detected. In these instances, conversion coefficients should be determined. Bell, page 6 The NEFSC agrees with the conclusions of the reviewers that effects of <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> offsets are minimal and likely within the magnitude of survey variability for most species. The recommendation to use the unadjusted trawl survey indices for regulated groundfish stocks has been followed. The species where significant differences were detected are not regulated groundfish species (i. e., sea scallop, herring, Loligo, smooth skate and winter skate). Calculating conversion coefficients for these species using only the data from the experiment would not be technically appropriate due to the multiple gear modifications in the experimental treatment and the associated concerns raised by all reviewers. Additional experimentation at different depths and warp offsets is necessary to estimate calibration coefficients, and might be possible with cooperative research projects. Group 2 ! The sensitivity tests carried out to evaluate the implications of the <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> offsets for the evaluation of stock status and rebuilding plans adequately bounded the range of potential introduced biases. Payne, Summary Point 1, page 3 C Yes, the 10, 25 and 100 % were reasonable magnitudes. Although, the magnitudes were all in the same direction, I acted under the assumption that the misconfigured gear had lower efficiency. In light of the number of instances wher...|$|E
40|$|Survey {{standardization}} procedures {{can reduce}} the variability in trawl catch efficiency thus producing more precise estimates of biomass. One such procedure, towing with equal amounts of <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> {{on both sides of}} the net, was experimentally investigated for its importance in determining optimal trawl geometry and for evaluating the effectiveness of the recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) national protocol on accurate measurement of trawl warps. This recent standard for measuring warp length requires that the difference between warp lengths can be no more than 4 % of the distance between the otter doors measured along the bridles and footrope. Trawl performance data from repetitive towing with warp differentials of 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 20 m were analyzed for their effect on three determinants of flatfish catch efficiency: footrope distance off-bottom, bridle length in contact with the bottom, and area swept by the net. Our results indicated that the distortion of the trawl caused by asymmetry in <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> length could have a negative inf luence on flatfish catch efficiency. At a difference of 7 m in warp length, the NOAA 4 % threshold value for the 83112 Eastern survey trawl used in our study, we found no effect on the acous-tic-based measures of door spread, wing spread, and headrope height off-bottom. However, the sensitivity of the trawl to 7 m of warp offset could be seen as footrope distances off-bottom increased slightly (particularly in the center region of the net where flatfish escapement is highest), and as the width of the bridle path responsible for flatfish herding, together with the effective net width, was reduced. For this survey trawl, a NOAA threshold value of 4 % should be considered a maximum. A more conservative value (less than 4 %) would likely reduce potential bias in estimates of relative abundance caused by large differences in warp length approaching 7 m...|$|E
40|$|My review {{consists}} of an executive summary and then responses to the questions posed {{in the terms of}} reference. Due to the limitations of time, I was unable to address a number of the specific questions in the depth and detail that I had wished to. I was also not able to find the time to specifically review the assessments for individual groundfish species, even the ones of greatest importance. Rather, I chose to focus on what I believed to be the areas where I could provide the most substantive comments. These were in particular with regard to key aspects of the methodologies and evaluations applied by the NEFSC to (a) address the <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> offset issue, (b) compute and select values for Fmsy and Bmsy, and (c) conduct projection evaluations. Due to the fundamental importance of providing a critique that was coherent and legible there was no time available to address all of the issues equally well. I was also not able to find time to address directly the written questions posed in to the reviewers {{at the end of the}} Groundfish Review and Assessment meeting in Durham Feb. 3 - 5. However, many of these questions will undoubtedly have been answered in various places within my review. The review is organized as follows. It begins with my Executive Summary that summarizes my main findings and recommendation. The main body of the work is my detailed review that addresses the points in the terms of reference one by one...|$|E
5000|$|On 30 April 1976 {{during the}} cod wars, she rammed the {{offshore}} patrol vessel ICGV Odin in the stern, after Odin had made three attempts {{to cut the}} Corsair's <b>trawl</b> <b>warps.</b> The skipper, Charles Pitts, said that Icelandic seamen were becoming [...] "more ambitious and dangerous in their tactics". With his ship holed below the waterline, and patched up temporarily by the Royal Navy, Pitts decided to head for home for permanent repairs. Arctic Corsair was out of action for several months.|$|R
2500|$|Side {{trawlers}} {{have the}} trawl deployed {{over the side}} with the <b>trawl</b> <b>warps</b> passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, Ross Tiger is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used {{for a longer period}} than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums.|$|R
50|$|The Mincarlo was {{the type}} of trawler known as a sidewinder or side trawler. On sidewinders, the trawl nets are {{deployed}} over the side with the <b>trawl</b> <b>warps</b> passed through blocks suspended from two gallows. These gallows were forward and aft, on the starboard side of the Mincarlo. The fishing gear consisted of two otter trawls each of which was fitted with otter boards. Otter boards keep the mouth of the trawl net open and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, pushes the boards outwards. This keeps the mouth of the net open. The nets were attached to heavy duty ground ropes, 40 ft long, which held the nets on the seabed and ticked up any fish lying on or below the sand. Until the late sixties, sidewinders were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. They were used for a longer period than other types of trawler.|$|R
40|$|Since 1988, a {{stratified}} random summer {{bottom trawl}} survey in Flemish Cap (NAFO Regulatory Area of Div. 3 M) {{was conducted by}} UE. Since 2003 the trawl vessel was replaced, the new vessel was calibrated and the indexes transformed. The lack of time has no permitted to transform the biomass and abundance shrimp indexes of the whole time series. So, the indexes in the series from 1988 to 2002 have not been changed by now and only the 2003 and 2004 indexes from the R/V Vizconde de Eza have been transformed to the R/V Cornide de Saavedra scale, to make them comparable to the results obtained in previous years. The shrimp catches taken with the same gear type Lofoten by both vessels from comparative fishing trials were very different, not only in weight but also in number. These results were interpreted on main differences between both vessels: trawl winch with an automatic control of the warp tension, higher vertical opening in the net and <b>trawl</b> <b>warp</b> length longer in the new vessel. Also, in the catches of the new vessel the presence of young shrimps was {{higher than in the}} old one. Because of this, abundance and biomass indexes from 2003 and 2004 were transformed using two methods based in conversion of CPUE and length frequencies and comparing the resulting estimates between them. Although there was not severe differences between these two methods, the marked differences in the length distribution of the catches makes the catch rate strongly dependent of the fish length (Warren, 1997), and thus we think the length conversion method reflects better the differences between the vessels. About the situation of the stock, a significan decreasing shrimp abundance and biomass is observed {{in the last two years}} (2003 - 2004), probably due to declining of 3 and 5 age-classes. Also, the strong presence of the youngest model groups (age 1 and 2) in the catches predicts good recruitment in next years...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of individual gadoids to a bottom-trawling vessel {{has been observed}} in situ in the Barents Sea using a free-floating buoy and acoustic target-tracking methods. More than 20 000 tracks were analysed in terms of velocity changes in vertical, athwarthship, and alongship direction relative to the vessel, the <b>warps,</b> and the <b>trawl,</b> respectively. The fish starts diving about 15 min before vessel passing. This coincides with the time the trawl is running and not with the gradual increase in vessel noise caused by the approaching vessel. The change in horizontal movement is more gradual and is directed away from the vessel in the alongship direction, but towards the vessel in the athwarthship direction. The strongest and sharpest response {{is related to the}} <b>trawl</b> <b>warps.</b> A strong herding in front of the warps is seen. Closer to the bottom, an athwarthship herding reaction is seen away from the trawl doors or possibly the lower parts of the warps. There were only minor differences when grouping the tracks according to light level, fish size, and fish density...|$|R
2500|$|Mechanised hauling {{devices are}} used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson winches, [...] and other {{auxiliary}} winches are installed on deck {{to control the}} towing <b>warps</b> (<b>trawling</b> wires) and store them when not in use.|$|R
50|$|Adult terns {{have few}} predators, but in Namibia {{immature}} birds are often robbed of their food by kelp gulls, and that species, along with Hartlaub's gull, silver gull and sacred ibis, {{has been observed}} feeding on eggs or nestlings, especially when colonies are disturbed. Smaller subcolonies with a relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more predation. In Australia, predation by cats and dogs, and occasional deaths by shooting or collisions with cars, wires or light-towers have been documented.Commercial fisheries can have {{both positive and negative}} effects on the greater crested tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due {{to the development of a}} large prawn trawl fishery. Conversely, purse-seine fishing reduces the available food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of great crested terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by purse-seine fishing. Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with <b>trawl</b> <b>warps,</b> trapped in <b>trawls</b> or discarded gear, or hooked by longline fishing, but, unlike albatrosses and petrels, there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for a reduction in required propeller power by optimizing the transverse position of attachment points for <b>trawl</b> <b>warps,</b> simulating a system of movable trawl blocks. Full scale measurements from the 65 meter long stern trawler F/T Prestfjord is used as a basis. A surge, sway and yaw manoeuvring model based on Lagrangian mechanics is used together with control forces from trawl, rudder and propeller is put into a bounded optimization algorithm to find the transverse position of trawl blocks requiring the lowest thrust. The bounds are the original placement of the port-side and starboard blocks, i. e 5. 08 meters. The result is a small reduction in power. For the operational profile from the data-set, the mean reduction in power is 0. 64 %. During trawling, the mean reduction in power is 1. 13 % when pulling a double trawl, and 1. 11 % when a single trawl is pulled. This is smaller than earlier reports have found, and it is not certain that such a system will be beneficial in an economical perspective when investment and maintenance cost is included. Differences to earlier reports seem to be based on rudder size and efficiency. The power reduction is greatest in relation to manoeuvring, while it is more stable when trawling on a straight course with a drift angle...|$|R
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} – use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam <b>trawl,</b> one <b>warp</b> {{on each side}}. Double-rig beam trawlers can tow {{a separate}} trawl {{on each side of}} the trawler. Beam trawling is used in the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|R
25|$|Otter {{trawlers}} {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated {{by its own}} winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel <b>trawls,</b> using three <b>warps,</b> each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.|$|R
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam <b>trawl,</b> with the <b>warps</b> going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|R
40|$|The ESB {{bottom trawl}} survey, with current design and {{sampling}} effort, is generally adequate for producing consistent and precise estimates of relative abundance for major fish and crab species over time, including walleye pollock, Pacific cod, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, snow and tanner crabs. The bottom trawl survey generally covers soft-bottom habitats and will therefore not {{be suitable for}} fish and invertebrate species that favor hard-bottom substrate, such as blue king crab. The very strong quality-control and quality assurance program implemented by AFSC to standardize trawl sampling protocols and <b>trawl</b> performance (<b>warp</b> length, wing-spread, net width, towing distance, etc.) minimize sources of errors in area-swept estimates due to changes in survey vessels over time. AFSC has excellent routines for data quality control, correction, and archiving, securing a database with high quality information. The EBS trawl survey is generally cost-effective for providing information that supports stock assessment and ecosystem forecast models used for stock assessment and harvest advice. The chosen systematic design with fixed stations is particularly suitable for estimating trends in abundance over time.

40|$|Bottom trawl {{fishing is}} a {{relevant}} extractive economic activity. However, {{the limitation of}} resources and {{the impact on the}} environment demand for a more rational exploitation in order to render the activity sustainable and productive in a near future. To this purpose {{it is important to understand}} and to analyze the behaviour of fishing gears. DISPAR is a collaboration project between the UPC-CTVG and the CSIC aimed to move towards this direction. DISPAR includes a simulation module and a user-friendly interface software. The module of simulation solves the governing equations for different components of a bottom <b>trawl</b> gear (<b>warps,</b> otterboards, sweeps and net) and uses an iterative staggered strategy to account for coupling effects. Relevant outcomes are the configuration of the gear and the distribution of tensions under different fishing conditions such as fishing depth or towing speed. The former includes, for instance, otterboard opening, angle of attack, or warp geometry. The later allows to analyse the contribution of each component to the total gear drag. This simulation module is interfaced in order to facilitate data inputs and visualization of results to the final user. The resulting product is a multifunctional aid tool that complements data measurements, helps fishermen and sector companies to optimize bottom trawl gears, and deserves to pedagogic purposes.
