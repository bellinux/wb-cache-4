Massachusetts was scuttled {{off the coast of}} Pensacola in 1920 and used as an artillery target. The wreck was never scrapped and is now a Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. Oregon was initially preserved as a museum, but was sold for scrap during World War II. The scrapping was later halted and the stripped hulk was used as an ammunition barge during the battle of Guam. The hulk was finally sold for scrap in 1956.|$|E
25|$|Its hammer {{action is}} built into a {{removable}} assembly for easy maintenance, after the fashion of the Tokarev TT-30 pistol, whereas its slide rides inside the frame rails, rather than outside as in the traditional Browning pattern. This latter feature mimics the frame-to-receiver interface of its predecessor in Swiss military service, the Luger pistol, allowing for a very tight fit between the slide, barrel and frame without compromising reliability. This construction feature contributes to the unusually high accuracy for which the SIG P210 is known. It ships with a 50-meter (54.7 yd) <b>test</b> <b>target</b> typically showing a group of five to ten shots in a cluster under 5cm (2in) in diameter.|$|E

The remainder of 1938 was taken up with practical problems {{in the development of}} ASV. One change was the use of the new Western Electric 4304 tubes in place of the earlier 316As.

500|$|Additional {{tracking}} {{tests were}} carried out by Target Tracking Radars (TTRs) at Bell's Whippany, NJ labs and an installation on Ascension Island. The latter was first used {{in an attempt to}} track a SM-68 Titan on 29 March 1961, but the data download from Cape Canaveral simulating Zeus Acquisition Radar (ZAR) information failed. A second test on 28 May was successful. Later in the year the Ascension site tracked a series of four test launches, two Atlas, two Titan, generating tracking information for as long as 100 seconds. A ZAR at White Sands reached initial operation in June 1961, and was tested against balloons, aircraft, parachutes deployed from sounding rockets and Hercules missiles. A TTR was completed at White Sands in November, and testing with the complete system of ZAR, TTR and MTR ("all-up" [...] tests) began that month. On 14 December a Zeus passed within [...] of a Nike Hercules being used as a <b>test</b> <b>target,</b> a success that was repeated in March 1962. On 5 June 1963, President Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson visited White Sands to view missile launches, including a Zeus launch.|$|E

2500|$|The Solid State Phased Array Radar System (SSPARS) began {{replacing}} PAVE PAWS {{when the}} first AN/FPS-115 face was taken off-line for the radar upgrade. [...] New Raytheon AN/FPS-123 Early Warning Radars became operational in 19xx (Beale) and 19xx (Cape Cod) in each base's existing PAVE PAWS [...] "Scanner Building". RAF Fylingdales, UK and Clear Air Force Station, Alaska BMEWS stations became SSPARS radar stations when their respective AN/FPS-126 radar (3 faces) and 2001 Raytheon AN/FPS-120 Solid State Phased Array Radar became operational. [...] In 2007, 100 owners/trustees of amateur radio repeaters in the 420 to 450MHz band near AN/FPS-123 radars were notified to lower their power output to mitigate interference, and AN/FPS-123s {{were part of the}} Air Force Space Surveillance System by 2009. [...] The Beale AN/FPS-123 was upgraded to a Raytheon AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR), circa 2012, with capabilities to operate in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) ABM system—the Beale UEWR included Avionics, Transmit-Receive modules, [...] Receiver Exciter / <b>Test</b> <b>Target</b> Generator, Beam Steering Generator, Signal Processor, and other changes.

40|$|Few {{identification}} methods will rapidly or specifically detect all {{bacteria in}} the order Chlamydiales, family Chlamydiaceae. In this study, three PCR tests based on sequence data from over 48 chlamydial strains were developed for identification of these bacteria. Two tests exclusively recognized the Chlamydiaceae: a multiplex <b>test</b> <b>targeting</b> the ompA gene and the rRNA intergenic spacer and a TaqMan <b>test</b> <b>targeting</b> the 23 S ribosomal DNA. The multiplex test was able to detect as few as 200 inclusion-forming units (IFU), while the TaqMan test could detect 2 IFU. The amplicons produced in these tests ranged from 132 to 320 bp in length. The third <b>test,</b> <b>targeting</b> the 23 S rRNA gene, produced a 600 -bp amplicon from strains belonging to several families in the order Chlamydiales. Direct sequence analysis of this amplicon has facilitated the identification of new chlamydial strains. These three tests permit ready identification of chlamydiae for diagnostic and epidemiologic study.

40|$|This {{study will}} present a simple, quick, and {{inexpensive}} way to producing sinusoidal <b>test</b> <b>targets,</b> which can then be used in measuring the image quality of a photographic system {{by way of a}} coherent system. The sinusoidal <b>test</b> <b>targets</b> will be produced from a series of bar targets using Fourier Optics, and a comparison study will be made between measuring MTF with a laser and a microdensitometer. A defocused target series will also be produced to note the change in MTF of the photographic system. The results indicate that sinusoidal <b>test</b> <b>targets</b> can be made quickly and inexpensively, and then can be used to provide meaningful data in evaluating a system. It was found that the laser method used in measuring the MTF of a photographic system was found to be superior to the microdensitometer in convenience, in speed, and in noise reduction. However, the microdensitometer can perform tests which the laser cannot, which still makes the microdensitometer an essential and invaluable tool in measuring the image quality of a system...|$|R
