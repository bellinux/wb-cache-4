The grain filling stage was also unaffected by irrigation frequency as was seasonal water use and water use efficiency.

Soybean grain yields, as well as all their interactions, affect the significance level P= 0. 01.

50|$|Fields were {{organised}} for {{the convenience}} of the farmer - both arable and pastoral. Therefore, the size of fields often gives an indication of the type of agriculture and agricultural implements in use when they were established. The shape and orientation of collections of fields provides clues about the date they were established. <b>Field</b> <b>systems</b> can give an indication of land ownership and social structure. The extent to which the <b>field</b> <b>system</b> respects other features (or not) can be used as dating evidence for the other features or the <b>field</b> <b>system</b> itself. For example, a <b>field</b> <b>system</b> that doesn't respect a Roman road is likely to predate it. Similarly, a feature that respects medieval ridge and furrow is likely to post date it.|$|R

The considered processes in the model are methane production, methane consumption and transport of methane by diffusion, ebullition and through plants. The model has been tested against data from a <b>three-year</b> <b>field</b> study from a Michigan peatland. The interannual and seasonal variations of the modelled methane emissions and methane concentration profiles are in good agreement with the observations. During the growing season the main emission pathway proceeds through plants.

Two were different measures of song (repertoire size and song flighting) and one a measure of territory (territory size). Repertoire and territory size had a significant influence on pairing date in all three years, and song-flighting in two. The three cues were not intercorrelated and so had independent effects upon pairing date. We suggest that females select males upon multiple cues as these reflect different aspects of male and territory quality...|$|R
