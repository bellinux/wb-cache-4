"In these days, the {{construction}} and guidance of airships have been improved greatly", wrote The Providence Journal, [...] "and it is supposed, both by the Parisian experts and by the Swedish scientists who have been assisting M. Andree, {{that the question of}} a sustained flight in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be very satisfactorily answered by the character of the balloon, by its careful guidance and, providing it gets into a Polar current of air, by the elements themselves."Faith in the experts and in science was common in the popular press, but with international attention came also for the first time informed criticism. Andrée being Sweden's first balloonist, no national had the requisite knowledge to second-guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but both Germany and France had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about Andrée's methods and inventions. However, just as with the Svea mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andrée's optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known aeronaut and balloon builder Henri Lachambre in Paris, world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer silk balloon, 20.5meters (67ft) in diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called Le Pôle Nord (French for [...] "The North Pole"), was to be renamed Örnen (Swedish for [...] "The Eagle").|$|E

2500|$|Perturbation theory also {{fails to}} {{describe}} {{states that are}} not generated adiabatically from the [...] "free model", including bound states and various collective phenomena such as solitons. Imagine, for example, {{that we have a}} system of free (i.e. non-interacting) particles, to which an attractive interaction is introduced. Depending on the form of the interaction, this may create an entirely new set of eigenstates corresponding to groups of particles bound to one another. An example of this phenomenon may be found in conventional superconductivity, in which the phonon-mediated attraction between conduction electrons leads to the formation of correlated electron pairs known as Cooper pairs. When faced with such systems, one usually turns to other approximation schemes, such as the variational method and the WKB approximation. This is because there is no analogue of a bound particle in the unperturbed model and the energy of a soliton typically goes as the inverse of the expansion parameter. However, if we [...] "integrate" [...] over the solitonic phenomena, the nonperturbative corrections in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be tiny; of the order of exp(−1/) or exp(−1/2) in the perturbation parameter [...] Perturbation theory can only detect solutions [...] "close" [...] to the unperturbed solution, even if there are other solutions for which the perturbative expansion is not valid.|$|E

2500|$|The {{index of}} {{refraction}} (or refractive index) {{is a way of}} measuring the speed of light in a material. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical singlemode fiber used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1,500nm, and a core of doped silica with an index around 1.4475. The larger the {{index of refraction}}, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 kilometers per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 milliseconds to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about [...] of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>will</b> probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).|$|E
