500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is now un guerre à mort and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always {{feel that they are}} practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E

[...] She described that in February 2002, while discussing an inquiry from the office of Vice President Cheney about the alleged Iraqi uranium purchases, a colleague who knew of her husband's diplomatic background and previous work with the CIA suggested sending him, and that she agreed to facilitate the discussion between her husband and her superiors despite her own ambivalence about the idea.|$|E
