5|$|The Chili Peppers {{collaborated with}} {{producer}} Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Rubin felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion, {{and the band}} agreed. Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there {{for the duration of}} the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside, and spent most of their time smoking marijuana. Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, none of which has ever been released.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1893, Cao Thang {{proposed}} a full-scale {{attack on the}} provincial seat of Nghệ An and the surrounding posts. The plan proposed to Phan included diversions {{to the south and}} the training of almost 2,000 men in conventional military tactics. Unconvinced of its viability, Phan reluctantly approved the plan. The troops were eager, but after overpowering several small posts en route, the main force was pinned down while attacking the French fort of No on September 9, 1893. Along with his brother, Cao Thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky frontal attack with 150 men, and the forces retreated in disarray. Phan regarded the loss of Cao Thang as a significant one, admitting as much in delivering the eulogy and funeral oration. According to the historian David Marr, there was evidence that Phan clearly realised the advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance. Although Phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success, the guerrilla leader thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> keep pressuring the French in order to demonstrate to the populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from the Huế court.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E

One of the major individuals involved was Davis McCaughey, who later became Governor of Victoria. The university was named after Charles Joseph La Trobe, the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto. The La Trobe University Coat of Arms incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and sprigs of heath to represent Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Most Ashkenazim {{have the}} custom {{to fill a}} fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic {{discussion}} that concerns the number of cups {{that are supposed to}} be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6-7, some rabbis felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question {{as to whether or not}} the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which - by this stage - was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until Elijah (in reference to the notion that Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the Kos shel Eliyahu ("Cup of Elijah"). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the Jewish Messiah.|$|E

He continued {{to say that it}} need to be [...] "futuristic" [...] but retain the naturalness of what is featured in Avatar. The inspiration for the ultra-violet forest and the light piercing through the canapes of the trees in the video came from the film itself, which were re-created in a controlled studio environment. Nava went to visit Cameron in his studio to choose clips from the film which would be included intercut with Lewis in the video.|$|E
500|$|David Scheffer, {{director}} of the Northwestern University School of Law Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations was a complicating factor. [...] "Normally when an individual is under indictment {{the purpose is to}} capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him... The object is not to literally summarily execute him if he's under indictment." [...] Scheffer and another expert stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him.

Chris Carter has also praised Ivanek's involvement with the episode, calling the actor's portrayal [...] "just an amazing performance. This guy, Zeljko, should have won an award for this". Glen Morgan, a regular writer for the series, felt that the episode [...] "wasn't completely effective", but also added that it offered a [...] "softer" [...] outlook compared to the series' other episodes so far, feeling <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> include several [...] "episodes that demonstrate the paranormal isn't always horrifying".|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Carol Case and Hawley {{worked closely}} together to develop Fargo costumes. Case saw {{the show as}} a big undertaking because of her desire to capture the [...] "specific feeling" [...] of 1970s fashion. Starting [...] "from scratch", the design team sought to create a [...] "really small-town America" [...] style {{for most of the}} show's wardrobe. They also felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the style of the rural characters, who at that time were largely unaware of fashion trends, from that of the urban characters. For the urban characters, Case used clothes she bought from New York to create a more polished, sleek look. Though Fargo producers bought a few pieces months in advance of production, sourcing vintage wear proved to be daunting, especially for cold weather, since much of the available supply was inadequately insulated. As a consequence, many costumes, such as Dunst's, were either modified by adding insulation, or created anew by the design team. Some modern pieces were used for footwear and accessories.|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} {{tributes to}} Demoitié, many riders also called for {{improved}} safety for professional bike races.

Alberto Contador tweeted [...] "Regulations on motos in races are needed NOW", while other riders called for clear rules, speed limits and exams for race motorbike riders.
