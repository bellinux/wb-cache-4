5|$|In the present, Detective Munch {{does not}} believe Byers' story, but it is soon corroborated by Mulder. After the Lone Gunmen are released, they {{encounter}} Susanne after she has failed to get the press <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> story; she tells them to reveal the truth to {{as many people as}} possible. Susanne is then captured by X, who leers at the Lone Gunmen as he departs with her. Later, the three of them meet Mulder in the convention center and explain what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) {{dreams that}} she pushes {{a woman in}} front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just in her head. In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her,</b> as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E
5|$|By August, Lucien, his {{children}} and Dermide had all suffered from bouts of fever. Doctors saw no cause for alarm and Lucien quickly recovered, as did {{his children}}. Despite the doctors' best efforts, Dermide died on 14 August, {{at the age of}} six. Pauline later came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> son's blood had been thinned by the recurrent spells of yellow fever they had suffered in Saint-Domingue. Borghese decided to conceal Dermide's death from his wife until her health improved. Thus, Francesco returned to Frascati and wrote three letters addressed to Pauline: one which announced the onset of Dermide's illness, the second announcing that the illness worsened and the third announcing Dermide's demise. Immediately after receiving the first letter, Pauline began making preparations for her departure from Pisa, in order to reach her son at Frascati. Before this was possible, she became aware of the truth and her suspicions were confirmed by de la Ronde.|$|E

It is not so very far from pitying <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>her.</b> How could I feel sure {{that you might not}} suspect me?" ...|$|R

5|$|Peter {{brings the}} fat men {{back to his}} home to protect them, but after {{learning}} from Brian that Patrick is the killer, a chase between the fat men and Patrick ensues. Brian, still at the house, shows Patrick's room to Lois, where several of his victims are either deceased or had been left for dead, and photographic evidence of Patrick killing them. Lois continues to make crazy excuses, still wanting <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> brother is a sane person, but ultimately she snaps out of her denial and realizes that Patrick is dangerous. Lois and Brian pursue Patrick and Peter into the woods, where Patrick is strangling Peter. Patrick quickly releases Peter after Lois threatens to stab Marion, his imaginary wife. Patrick apologizes, telling Lois that he never meant to hurt her, and the two agree he should be sent back to the mental hospital, where Lois and the family plan to visit him once a month.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Joel and Ellie {{was the central}} focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed {{to the development of}} the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Ellie's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us, but the team found it difficult <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> car is a ghost car.|$|E

5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Cur√© Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her,</b> claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E
5|$|Danielle later {{breaks down}} and tells Ronnie {{that she is}} {{pregnant}} by Paul, a barman she had a one-night stand with. She intended {{to tell him about}} her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend. Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy, suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie. She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life. Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy. She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, so in order to preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression and she should keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts her off to maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her.</b> Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by a car driven by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Ronnie cradles Danielle and apologises for not believing her, saying that if she had known, she would never have given her up. Danielle passes away in Ronnie's arms as Roxy, Stacey and Janine watch on helpless, leaving Ronnie devastated. Danielle is buried and a grief-stricken Ronnie sings by her grave when alone.|$|E
25|$|In August 1986, she {{contacted}} her ex-boyfriend, who was by then {{a resident}} at a hospital, and {{claimed to have}} had his child. When he refused <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her,</b> Dann called the hospital where he worked and claimed he had raped her in the emergency room.|$|E

25|$|If pseudo-Martyrius is <b>to</b> be <b>believed,</b> <b>her</b> two pregnancies (due late in 403 {{and late}} in 404, respectively) ended not in miscarriages, as {{previously}} supposed, but stillbirths, the second caused Eudoxia's death from hemorrhaging and infection.|$|R

25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs {{show that there is}} a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E
25|$|Aydrian Wyndon {{is the son}} of Elbryan and Jilseponie (Pony) Wyndon. He {{was taken}} and raised {{secretly}} by Lady Dasselrond, the Queen of the Touel'alfar. The elves had allowed Pony <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> child had died in the womb in her spirit battle with Father Abbot Markwart (who at the time was possessed by the spirit of the Demon Dactyl). Also kept secret from all, including the elves, was that the Demon Dactyl's spirit had infected the child's soul, and left a piece of itself there.|$|E
25|$|Upon returning, the {{passengers}} discover that {{what seemed like}} many hours took {{no time at all}} from Earth's perspective. They also find that all of their video footage has been erased, presumably by magnetic fields in the wormholes. After seeing that Hadden is apparently dead and that the transmission has somehow been stopped without a 26 year delay, government officials accuse the travellers of an international conspiracy. They blackmail Ellie and her fellow travellers into silence until more evidence can be found. Palmer Joss becomes {{one of the few people}} willing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> story that she can only justify on faith.|$|E

60|$|Fortunately, {{no notice}} was {{taken of the}} exclamation, though it was hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>her</b> words had not been overheard; and presently, {{recovering}} from my fright, I apologized for hurting her, and hoped she would forgive me.|$|R

25|$|The victim, {{now married}} and going {{by the name}} Samantha Geimer, stated in an {{interview}} with Larry King that the police and media had been slow {{at the time of the}} assault <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> account, which she attributed to the social climate of the era. In 1988 she sued Polanski. Among other things, the suit alleged sexual assault, false imprisonment, seduction of a minor, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In 1993, Polanski agreed to settle with Geimer. In August 1996, Polanski still owed her $604,416; Geimer and her lawyers later confirmed that the settlement was completed.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus had {{a strange}} birth that evokes the {{difficulty}} in fitting him into the Olympian pantheon. His mother was a mortal woman, Semele, the daughter of king Cadmus of Thebes, and his father was Zeus, {{the king of the}} gods. Zeus's wife, Hera, discovered the affair while Semele was pregnant. Appearing as an old crone (in other stories a nurse), Hera befriended Semele, who confided in her that Zeus was the actual father of the baby in her womb. Hera pretended not <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her,</b> and planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind. Curious, Semele demanded of Zeus that he reveal himself in all his glory as proof of his godhood.|$|E
25|$|Tabloids {{from the}} time claimed that, at some point after her infant {{daughter}} and husband both died, a Boston medium told her (while supposedly channeling her late husband) that she should leave her home in New Haven and travel West, where she must continuously build a home for herself and the spirits {{of people who had}} fallen victim to Winchester rifles. Winchester left New Haven and headed for California. Though it is possible she was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that Winchester came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> family and fortune were haunted by ghosts, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits.|$|E
25|$|Mom {{gets home}} and Candace thinks that, at last, Mom {{will see what}} the boys have been up <b>to</b> and <b>believe</b> <b>her.</b> But just as Mom is about {{to step into the}} back yard, all {{evidence}} vanishes, usually as a side effect of Doofenshmirtz's device.|$|R

60|$|His politeness was great, {{but he was}} plainly delighted, and {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>her</b> demand sprang from affection, and not naughtiness.

25|$|Henry is {{now making}} ends meet as {{freelance}} cab driver, struggling with writer's block after the failure of his book, Once Upon a Time. When Lucy arrives at his apartment, she tells Henry that she is his daughter and that his family needs him, although Henry refuses <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> and turns her away. The next day, Jacinda, Lucy's mother, shows up late for work at Cluck's Chicken, but quits when calling out her boss for his bad temper. When she returns to her apartment, she tells her roommate, about having quit her job, but is stunned to find that Lucy has snuck out without her knowledge. In Belfrey Tower, Jacinda's stepmother Victoria grows increasingly irritated with what she sees as Jacinda's irresponsibility, and plans on taking full custody of her granddaughter, all while buying out smaller businesses and raising rent to push the cursed inhabitants out of the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Subha {{goes to her}} {{genetics}} {{department and}} announces that Operation Red can be stopped if they read and {{make use of the}} cures in a book written by Bodhidharma. However, the department laughs and refuses <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her,</b> claiming that an ancient book is of no use in modern times, much to Subha's dismay. After some time, Subha and Aravind learn that Subha's professor from the genetics department is assisting Dong Lee in Operation Red. They sneak into the professor's apartment and learn about the operation. The next day, the professor is caught red-handed by Aravind, Subha and her friends, but surrenders and explains that he received a huge sum of money from the China government if he carried out Operation Red. After the professor gives the gang more details about Operation Red and how to stop it, they leave. However, after a while, Dong Lee arrives and the professor once again teams up with him to save his own life.|$|E

As a stunned Ingrid kneels by her frozen sister, Helga's body crumbles into a pile of ice shards. As Gerda shows up, she is stunned by what Ingrid did to Helga. Refusing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>her</b> and fearing that Ingrid has become a danger to everyone around her, Gerda takes the urn and traps a sobbing Ingrid inside. Later, Gerda goes to the Grand Pabbie and asks him to make a potion that will cause the residents of Arendelle to forget Ingrid and Helga ever existed {{in order to protect the}} future of the kingdom. He warns her that magic comes at a price but agrees to make the memory potion.|$|E
