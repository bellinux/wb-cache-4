5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S. The aim of <b>this</b> <b>proposition</b> is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|In <b>this</b> <b>Proposition,</b> Newton derives the {{consequences}} of his theorem of revolving orbits in the limit of nearly circular orbits. This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth. This approximation also allows Newton to consider a great variety of central force laws, not merely inverse-square and inverse-cube force laws.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>proposition</b> {{is based}} on Galileo’s {{analysis}} of a body following a parabolic trajectory under the action of a constant acceleration. In Proposition 10, he describes it as Galileo’s Theorem, and mentions Galileo several other times in relation {{to it in the}} Principia. Combining it with Kepler's Second Law gives the simple and elegant method.|$|E

5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, <b>this</b> <b>proposition</b> was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, <b>this</b> <b>proposition</b> is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|In 341BC Demosthenes {{was sent}} to Byzantium, where he sought to renew its {{alliance}} with Athens. Thanks to Demosthenes' diplomatic manoeuvres, Abydos also entered into an alliance with Athens. These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes. The Assembly, however, laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty; so doing, in effect, amounted to an official declaration of war. In 339BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece, assisted by Aeschines' stance in the Amphictyonic Council. During {{a meeting of the}} Council, Philip accused the Amfissian Locrians of intruding on consecrated ground. The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians. Aeschines agreed with <b>this</b> <b>proposition</b> and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress. * C. Carey, Aeschines, 7–8. Demosthenes however reversed Aeschines' initiatives and Athens finally abstained. After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians, the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gave command of the league's forces to Philip and asked him to lead a second excursion. Philip decided to act at once; in the winter of 339–338BC, he passed through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians. After this significant victory, Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338BC. He then turned south-east down the Cephissus valley, seized Elateia, and restored the fortifications of the city.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 283; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{combines}} {{these two}} propositions into a third proposition, a complete statement {{of our common}} sense notions of duty. <b>This</b> <b>proposition</b> is that ‘duty is necessity of action from respect for law.’ (4:400) This final proposition serves {{as the basis of}} Kant’s argument for the supreme principle of morality, the categorical imperative.|$|E

25|$|The {{rational}} choice approach to religion draws a close analogy {{between religion and}} the market economy. Religious firms compete against one another to offer religious products and services to consumers, who choose between the firms. To the extent {{that there are many}} religious firms competing against each other, they will tend to specialize and cater to the particular needs of some segments of religious consumers. This specialization and catering in turn increase the number of religious consumers actively engaged in the religious economy. <b>This</b> <b>proposition</b> has been confirmed in a number of empirical studies.|$|E

WKL0 can also be defined as the principle of Σ01 separation (given two Σ01 formulas of a free variable n which are exclusive, there is a class containing all n satisfying the one and no n satisfying the other).|$|E

25|$|No {{indication}} {{is given}} {{of the method}} of reasoning {{that led to the}} result, although the Data does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the Elements. Some scholars have tried to find fault in Euclid's use of figures in his proofs, accusing him of writing proofs that depended on the specific figures drawn rather than the general underlying logic, especially concerning Proposition II of Book I. However, Euclid's original proof of <b>this</b> <b>proposition,</b> is general, valid, and does not depend on the figure used as an example to illustrate one given configuration.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand <b>this</b> <b>proposition.</b> On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the issues}} found with the distractor {{inhibition}} model, Tipper and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the distractors are suppressed. The Houghton–Tipper model revised <b>this</b> <b>proposition</b> and claims that inhibition occurs during both the encoding of distractors and the retrieval of that memory. The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves {{the memory of the}} stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus. Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.|$|E
