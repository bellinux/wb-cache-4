5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> brightness of the sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E
