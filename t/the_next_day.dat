5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and {{turn back to}} the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an eye. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had turned back to the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed off the Karnataka-Goa coastline in the Arabian Sea on May 27 and developed into a depression <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> The system developed further into a cyclonic storm on May 29 as it moved to the north. The storm reached its peak with 95km/h (60mph) soon after this as it turned to the west, but soon degenerated into a deep depression over the northern Arabian Sea on May 31. The depression continued to move west, weakening to a remnant low shortly as it made landfall on the Arabian Peninsula on June 2. The remnant low dissipated over southern Saudi Arabia <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} persisted {{toward the end}} of April between Diego Garcia and the equator. It developed a spiral area of convection on April24, which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> By that time, the system was already at tropical storm status and was given the name Karla. Moving southwest, the storm strengthened and organized. A ridge to the south steered Karla to the east on April27, although an approaching trough turned it to the southeast on the following day. Enhanced atmospheric instability helped the storm strengthen to tropical cyclone status on April29. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> Karla attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) after developing a well-defined eye. Increased wind shear and progressively cooler waters weakened the cyclone as it turned more to the south. By May3, the storm weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> within the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed well {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August29. Initially drifting westward, the storm gradually intensified and became a tropical storm early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> By August31, the system strengthened into a Category1 hurricane. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> the hurricane entered the Caribbean Sea, passing the island of Dominica as a Category2 hurricane. Continuing to intensify, the storm further intensified into a Category3 hurricane on September2 {{and then to a}} Category4 the following day. Around 18:00UTC on September3, the hurricane peaked with winds of 155mph (250km/h), observed by a ship. Simultaneously, the storm made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|After {{several days}} as a {{powerful}} typhoon, Fengshen began a weakening trend due to decreased outflow and dry air. It weakened below super typhoon status after being at that intensity for five days. On July24, Fengshen turned more to the west while passing {{to the south of}} mainland Japan, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> it weakened below typhoon intensity. At 1145UTC on July25, Fengshen made landfall on Yakushima in Japan's Ōsumi Islands, while a severe tropical storm. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> the storm passed a short distance southwest of Jeju Island offshore South Korea. After entering the Yellow Sea, Fengshen weakened into a tropical depression, and on July27 the JTWC discontinued advisories, after much of the convection had dissipated. The JMA continued tracking the system, and Fengshen made landfall on China's Shandong Peninsula late on July27. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> the depression dissipated over the Bohai Sea.|$|E
