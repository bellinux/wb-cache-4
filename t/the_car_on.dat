Ron remains immobile in his seat well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him.

The police officer on Go To Jail is wearing a New York City Police Department hat, not a Metropolitan Police helmet, while <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> Free Parking has a Whitewall spare tyre, which was uncommon in the UK.

5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E

5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms {{at one end of}} the car. There is a baggage rack at the end of <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>On</b> some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E
5|$|Ferris and {{his friends}} collect the Ferrari and depart for home, but shortly {{discover}} many miles {{have been added to}} the odometer, and Cameron becomes catatonic. Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> blocks and runs it in reverse to try to take miles off the odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E

25|$|How can the {{accelerating}} frame {{be discovered}} to be non-inertial? In the accelerating frame, everything {{appears to be}} subject to zero net force, and nothing moves. Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration on the seat from <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based simply on the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather {{it is based on the}} simplicity of the physical explanation for this compression.|$|E

During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and protégé Rubens Barrichello {{was involved in a}} serious accident when his Jordan became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1960s saw {{the release of the}} Moskvitch 408, intended to be an economy car that would spread the use of cars among the population. Other manufacturers such as MZMA, GAZ and ZAZ were offering a variety of cars intended for the mass market. The Soviet government opted to build an even larger car manufacturing plant that would produce a people's car and help to meet the demand for personal transport. For reasons of cost-efficiency, it was decided to produce <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>on</b> the basis of an existing, modern foreign model. After considering several options, the Fiat 124 was chosen because of its simple and sturdy design, being easy to manufacture and repair.|$|E
