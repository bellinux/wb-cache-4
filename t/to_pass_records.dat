5000|$|In 2014, the BBC {{learned that}} more than 50 people had {{instructed}} UK solicitors Bolt Burdon Kemp over historical abuse claims against The Scout Association since the Jimmy Savile scandal emerged. The association and individual Scout leaders have also paid £897,000 in damages, the lawyers for the claimants say. One MP urged an inquiry into failures <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>records</b> of abuse to police. The Scout Association disputed the figures, but said it was [...] "deeply sorry" [...] for anyone hurt by abusers' actions.|$|E

25|$|The 2009 fleet {{comprised}} 99 starters. In the 2008 race, Wild Oats XI had equalled Morna/Kurrewa IV's {{record of}} three consecutive line honours victories, which Morna achieved in 1946, 1947 and 1948, and was attempting <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the <b>record</b> {{in its own}} right in 2009.|$|R

50|$|In 1919, Belmonte fought 109 bullfighting corridas (bullfights), {{a number}} {{unmatched}} by any matador before, until the 1965 bullfight season when Manuel Benítez Pérez ("El Cordobés") performed in 111 corridas, surpassing Belmonte's record. The Mexican matador Carlos Arruza fought 108 corridas {{in one season}} but {{it is said that}} he refused <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Belmonte's <b>record</b> out of respect for the maestro.|$|R
50|$|Ling-Ling died {{suddenly}} from heart failure in December 1992, {{at which time}} she was the longest-lived giant panda in captivity outside China. Hsing-Hsing would go on <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> her <b>record</b> when he was euthanized by zookeepers in November 1999 {{at the age of}} 28 due to painful kidney failure. Following Hsing-Hsing's death, the zoo received thousands of letters and cards from people across the country expressing sympathy.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, councils {{have their}} own regulations. Some merely require a driver <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a Criminal <b>Records</b> Bureau {{disclosure}} and have a reasonably clean driving licence, while others use their own local versions of London's The Knowledge test.|$|R
50|$|A {{right-handed}} batsman, Kerr represented Scotland for 26 {{years and}} is their longest serving player of all time. His unbeaten 178 against Ireland in Dublin remained a national record for 3 decades until it was passed by James Aitchison. Aitchison was also the man <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> his <b>record</b> tally of 1975 runs for Scotland. Kerr played club cricket for Greenock and scored 21558 runs for them and made 49 hundreds.|$|R

50|$|Hall of Famers George Blanda and Billy Cannon {{benefited from}} his {{blocking}} as the Oilers {{won the first}} two AFL Championships. Talamini made first-team All-AFL in 1962 and was a regular at American Football League All-Star games, selected to six straight, through 1967. He anchored an offensive line that gave Blanda time <b>to</b> set <b>passing</b> <b>records</b> that would last for decades and opened holes {{for the likes of}} Cannon, Charlie Tolar, Sid Blanks and Hoyle Granger to run through. Talamini, Don Floyd and Jim Norton were the last of the original Oilers.|$|R
50|$|Cuddy {{appeals to}} Gail {{to admit the}} truth. Gail calls her an idiot, and says that she began {{stealing}} six months after she was hired. Cuddy takes the flower that was sitting on her desk {{and hands it to}} Nurse Regina. She explains that Lucas gave her the hidden microphone inside of it, and instructs Regina <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the <b>recording</b> of Gail's admission to the DEA. With one victory today, Cuddy goes to turn in her resignation to the board.|$|R
6000|$|This act {{also was}} passed without ayes and nays. In the Congress which passed it {{there were two}} of the [...] "thirty-nine." [...] They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton. As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is {{probable}} they both voted for it. They would not have allowed it <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> without <b>recording</b> their opposition to it if, in their understanding, it violated either the line properly dividing local from Federal authority, or any provision of the Constitution.|$|R
2500|$|He {{played for}} Old Collegians in Christchurch and Ian Cromb {{influenced}} {{him as a}} young club player. He made his first-class debut for Canterbury during the 1976-77 season.

5000|$|On 5 February, Barcelona {{broke the}} record for most {{consecutive}} league wins with 16 victories after they defeated Atlético Madrid 3-0 at Camp Nou. Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick to ensure the victory for his side and after the match stated, [...] "It's {{an honor to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a <b>record</b> set by a great like Di Stéfano" [...] and, [...] "If the record has been around for so long is because it's very complicated to achieve and we have reached it by defeating a very difficult team who's going through a bad situation, which makes it even more difficult." ...|$|R
25|$|According <b>to</b> family <b>records</b> <b>passed</b> {{down through}} the Houchin, and later Henderson families, John Houchin was bear hunting and the bear turned and began to chase him. He found the cave {{entrance}} when he ran into the cave for protection from the charging bear.|$|R

[...] For Landmark, Bobby Hutcherson recorded his most extensive sequence of latter-day albums. Landmark <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Muse <b>Records</b> in 1993.|$|R
50|$|Borzakovskiy's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} his {{victory in the}} 800 m race at the Athens Olympics in 2004. By this point, he was well known for sitting back until about the last 200 metres and then using a great kick to catch up and win, reminiscent of the tactics of U.S.A's Dave Wottle. At the Olympics he employed the same strategy, using this 'late charge' to come from behind in the last 150 meters <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> world <b>record</b> holder Wilson Kipketer, who was leading with only 20 metres to go, and take the victory. Borzakovskiy's decisive pass so deflated Kipketer that he allowed Mbulaeni Mulaudzi to nip him at the line.|$|R
50|$|After {{an injury}} filled 2013 season, Amos {{returned}} {{to form in}} 2014. At the 2014 Prefontaine Classic, Amos set a meet record and world leading time of 1:43.63. At the Herculis IAAF Diamond League, he again set a meet record and world leading mark of 1:42.45. Beating Rudisha for the 2nd time on the season, his performance was the fastest 800m race since the men's 800 m race. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Amos won the 800 meter Gold medal in 1:45.18. In the tactical affair, Amos maneuvered out of a box <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> World <b>Record</b> holder David Rudisha in the last 50 meters.|$|R

5|$|Leading the 2008 Texas Longhorn {{football}} team, McCoy and the Longhorns {{began the}} season with eight straight wins, including a win over then #1 Oklahoma, #6 Oklahoma State and #11 Missouri. His performance helped the Longhorns rise at one point to the #1 ranking in the national polls, although UT lost to Texas Tech University and finished ranked third in the BCS standings. In 2008 McCoy set school records for most career touchdown passes, most touchdown passes in a season, most total touchdowns by a Texas player, most career wins, and most career passing yards. In addition <b>to</b> setting <b>passing</b> <b>records,</b> McCoy led the team with 561 yards rushing and eleven rushing touchdowns, establishing {{a reputation as a}} dual threat quarterback. McCoy was named the 2008 AP Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year.|$|R
5000|$|When an RREQ message {{arrives at}} its destination, a [...] "Routing Reply" [...] (RREP) message will {{immediately}} be <b>passed</b> back <b>to</b> the origin, indicating that a {{route to the}} destination was found.

25|$|In July 2007, Muttiah Muralitharan {{became the}} second bowler after Australia's Shane Warne to capture 700 Test wickets. The off-spinner reached the {{landmark}} {{when he had}} Bangladesh's last man Syed Rasel caught in the deep by Farveez Maharoof {{on the fourth day}} of the third and final Test at the Asgiriya stadium in Kandy. The dismissal signalled Sri Lanka's victory by an innings and 193 runs to give the host a 3–0 sweep of the series. Muralitharan finished with six wickets in each innings to claim 10 wickets or more in a Test for the 20th time. However, he was unable <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Warne's <b>record</b> of 708 wickets when Sri Lanka toured Australia in November 2007, capturing just four wickets in two Test matches.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, Wilhelm {{finished}} with career highs in both saves (27) and games pitched (73). His ERA decreased to 1.99 that season; it remained less than 2.00 through the 1968 season. In 1965, Wilhelm contributed <b>to</b> another <b>passed</b> balls <b>record</b> when Chicago catcher J. C. Martin allowed 33 {{of them in}} one season. That total set a modern single-season baseball record for the category. Wilhelm's career-low ERA (1.31) came in 1967, when he earned an 8–3 record for the White Sox with 12 saves.|$|R
50|$|The {{race for}} which Singh is best remembered is his fourth-place {{finish in the}} 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games, which he had entered {{as one of the}} favourites. He led the race till the 200m mark before easing off, {{allowing}} others <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> him. Various <b>records</b> were broken in the race, which required a photo-finish and saw American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann. Singh's fourth-place time of 45.73 became the Indian national record and held for almost 40 years.|$|R
50|$|There {{was some}} {{good to the}} Steelers 2009 season. They were able to beat four {{eventual}} playoff-bound teams; the Green Bay Packers, the Minnesota Vikings, the Baltimore Ravens, and the San Diego Chargers. The Steelers offense gained 369.2 yards a game (263.1 coming through the air, and 106.1 coming on the ground.) The Steelers defense only allowed their opponents to compile 305.5 average yards per game, and allowed only an average of 89.3 yards a game on the ground. Ben Roethlisberger was able <b>to</b> set team <b>passing</b> <b>records</b> in the following categories: completion percentage, completions, attempts, and yards. The Steelers defense compiled 47 sacks, and the team finished with 41 total touchdowns and 3 defensive touchdowns.|$|R
50|$|He {{would follow}} up his Iowa State {{performance}} with a record-setting performance against West Virginia. Webb passed for 462 yards, 36-50 attempts, and two touchdowns, making Webb the first quarterback {{in school history}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> for over 400 yards twice in their freshman season. Additionally, the yardage broke the school freshman <b>passing</b> <b>record</b> previously held by Billy Joe Tolliver. The passing yardage also set a Big 12 Conference freshman <b>passing</b> <b>record,</b> beating the mark set by Baylor's Nick Florence in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Another {{eleven years}} were <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> before a <b>recording</b> appeared, that of 1984 under Mark Elder by the English National Opera. This {{production}} also toured to the United States in New York, New Orleans and Texas. Other productions {{of the opera}} in Britain have been undertaken by Welsh National Opera in 1992 and by Opera North in 2002. Central City Opera (in Colorado) presented the North American premiere production of the opera in 2001, starring Joyce Castle as Elizabeth I. The Opera Theatre of Saint Louis mounted the work in 2005, with Christine Brewer as Elizabeth I.|$|R
50|$|Typical of triple-option teams, the Midshipmen rarely {{threw the}} ball (attempting 143 passes in their first eleven games). Keenan Reynolds, the third {{freshman}} to start at quarterback in the team's history, started every game after the team's win against the Air Force Falcons (rushing for 628 yards on 140 carries during the season). In the win over Army, Reynolds completed 10 of 17 passes for 130 yards and received the game's Most Valuable Player award. With 758 career receiving yards, Gee Gee Greene needed 73 more in the bowl <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Reggie Campbell's <b>record</b> for most receiving yards by a Navy slotback.|$|R
5|$|On offense, the Jayhawks {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 344yards, 249of which came through the air. Quarterback Todd Reesing was the key contributor to the Kansas aerial attack, completing 20of his 37passes for 227yards and just one interception. The only other Kansas player <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>passing</b> yards was running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw a 22-yard first-down pass during a fake punt. Though under pressure {{for much of the}} game—Reesing was sacked four times—Kansas continued to maintain an effective pass attack throughout the game.|$|R
50|$|At first Kumagai {{went to the}} {{authorities}} concerneds of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, etc.. But they refused him. They took sides with the companies blown the whistle on. Therefore, {{he wrote a letter}} to CoCom. The contents were the details of the products which violated the CoCom regulations, and which had been exported and were likely to be exported to the Soviet Union. He attached documents on hand about the machine tools of nine axes. He wrote correctly the information, including his name, address, and telephone number. And he posted the letter written in English to CoCom headquarters in Paris, France in December, 1985. Because he worried about the assassination to him, he recorded in detail the event which he knew on work with the Soviet Union during summer from spring of 1986, and handed his friend the copy of this record. If he had an accident to him, he asked his friend <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the <b>record</b> <b>to</b> the address written on the letter.|$|R
5000|$|Botswana {{has been}} doing well in {{athletics}} looking at the works of Nijel Amos [...] winnig a silver medal in the men's 800 m race, the first Olympic medal for his country. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Amos won the 800 meter Gold medal in 1:45.18. In the tactical affair, Amos maneuvered out of a box <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> World <b>Record</b> holder David Rudisha in the last 50 meters. Botswana also has a good athlete Amantle Montsho who has won the silver medal at the 2006 African Championships and the {{gold medal at the}} 2007 All-Africa Games. At the All-Africa Games she also finished fifth in the 200 metres. She ran a personal best and Botswana record of 49.83 seconds to win at the 2008 African Championships in Athletics. It remains the Championship record for the event. At the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in South Korea, she narrowly beat Alyson Felix to become Botswana's first World or Olympic track and field champion.|$|R
50|$|Edith Durham {{recorded}} several methods traditionally considered {{effective for}} defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone {{could be placed}} {{at the entrance of}} a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> She further <b>recorded</b> the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|R
