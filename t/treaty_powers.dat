40|$|I count myself {{among those}} who suppose that the Constitution {{contains}} no subject matter limits on the <b>treaty</b> <b>power.</b> More precisely, I believe that the original Constitution granted the President {{the power to make}} international agreements, with no particular constraints on the subjects they might touch.

Today, many federalists see such a <b>Treaty</b> <b>Power</b> as a potential threat to the sovereignty of the states. Between 1998 and 2000, the Michigan Law Review published a series of articles by Curtis Bradley and David Golove on competing conceptions of how the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Power</b> fits in the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s federal structure. Bradley argued that federalism delimits the capacity of the national government to create binding national law through the forging of treaties. That is, the national government may not invade the sovereign province of the states by using the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Power</b> to circumvent the restrictions placed on the national government by federalism. In contrast, Golove argued that the national government may use the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Power</b> to legislate in areas generally reserved to the states so long as the Constitution does not explicitly prevent it.

This framework would be applied where the President has signed, and Congress has ratified, a treaty and Congress has enacted domestic legislation in some way satisfying the goals or requirements of the treaty. Under this framework, the inquiry into whether the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> could appropriately be used by Congress in excess of its Article I, Commerce Clause powers would be indexed {{to the strength of}} (1) the contract-like nexus between the necessarily reciprocal requirements and the goals of the treaty and the specific statutory provisions enacted, and (2) the visibly apparent connection between the treaty and the legislation.

Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration of Congress the propriety of the release of the Japanese Government from the further payment of the indemnity under the convention of October 22, 1864, and as no action had been taken thereon, it became my duty to regard the obligations of the convention as in force; and as the other powers interested had received their portion of the indemnity in full, the minister of the United States in Japan has, in behalf of this Government, received the remainder of the amount due to the United States under the convention of Simonosaki. I submit the propriety of applying the income of a part, if not of the whole, of this fund to the education in the Japanese language of a number of young men to be under obligations to serve the Government for a specified time as interpreters at the legation and the consulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the same time be educated in our own vernacular, and mutual benefits would result to both Governments. The importance of having our own citizens, competent and familiar with the language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in other capacities connected with the legation and the consulates in that country can not readily be overestimated.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the scope of}} the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> under the U. S. Constitution. A recent challenge in the courts has revived a debate over the reach and limits of the federal government’s <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> that dates to the Founding. This Article begins by placing today’s debate into historical perspective— examining the understanding of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> {{from the time of the}} Founding, through the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in 1920 in Missouri v. Holland, and up to the present. It then provides a systematic account of the actual and potential court-enforced limits on the treaty power— including affirmative constitutional limits, limits on implementing legislation, and limits on {{the scope of the}} Article II <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> itself. In the process, the Article develops a detailed pretext test that courts could use to assess whether the federal government has exceeded its Article II authority. Yet even this elaborated pretext test is unlikely to be used to invalidate many treaties. Hence the most important protection against abuse of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> comes not from the courts but from structural, political, and diplomatic checks on the exercise of the power itself—checks that this Article describes and assesses. These checks provide for “top-down” and “bottom-up” federalism accommodation. The result is a flexible system in which the states and the federal government work together to preserve the boundary between their respective areas of sovereignty. The Article concludes that this flexible system of accommodation is likely to be more effective than any court-enforced restraint at protecting against abuse of the federal <b>treaty</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

40|$|Peter Irons’ WAR POWERS favors congressional {{initiative}} in questions {{of war and}} peace but makes a historical argument that our government has strayed from the constitutional design in the service of an imperialist foreign policy. John Yoo’s THE POWERS OF WAR AND PEACE seeks to overthrow the traditional perspective on war powers espoused by Irons in favor of executive {{initiative in}} war. Yoo also pursues a revisionist perspective on the <b>treaty</b> <b>power,</b> which favors executive initiative in treaty negotiation and interpretation but insists on congressional implementation so as to minimize the impact of international obligations on domestic law. This Essay criticizes Irons’ approach for its failure to provide a normative defense of congressional initiative in war and takes issue with some of the historical and structural analyses underlying Yoo’s defense of executive unilateralism in the realm of war powers. Because Yoo’s arguments on the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> raise questions of methodological consistency, he is susceptible to the criticism that his arguments are motivated more by prudential and policy considerations than by fidelity to constitutional text, structure and history. The Essay concludes that, while the constitutional text, structure and history are clear and consistent and support Irons’ arguments fovoring congressional war powers, the Constitution provides little guidance on how the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> should operate. Yoo’s view that treaties do not bind the President finds no support in constitutional text or structure.

40|$|This Comment {{considers}} a fundamental {{question about the}} relationship between state and national sovereignty in our federal system: may individuals hold state governments accountable in federal court for violations of treaty-based rights? The answer to this question appeared to be negative until the Supreme Court decided Central Virginia Community College v. Katz, holding that state sovereign immunity did not bar an individual suit against a state pursuant to federal bankruptcy law. To reach this holding, the Court did not rely on traditional principles of sovereign immunity abrogation. Rather, the Court concluded that in ratifying the Constitution, the states surrendered their sovereign immunity with regard to private suits based on federal bankruptcy law. So far, the Katz decision is unique in upholding a private right of action against a state based on an implied surrender of state sovereign immunity in the Constitution, but its reasoning is applicable to contexts other than bankruptcy. Perhaps no other federal power is as ideal a candidate for an application of Katz than the <b>treaty</b> <b>power.</b> By analyzing the history of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power,</b> the Framers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power,</b> and the function of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> in the U. S. federal system, this Comment concludes that in ratifying the Constitution the states surrendered their sovereign immunity to private lawsuits brought to enforce treaty-based rights. Over the last thirty years, a number of commentators have considered whether states are amenable to treaty-based private suits, with opinions splitting evenly. This Comment is the first to apply the principles of Katz to the treaty context, and the first to consider the understandings and the practices of the founding generation with regard to the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> in the years immediately following the Constitutional Convention. The significance of recognizing a surrender of state sovereign immunity to treaty-based suits is twofold. First, recognizing treaty-based suits opens a new avenue for individuals to vindicate their rights under treaties, including human rights and intellectual property rights. Second, recognizing treaty-based suits promotes the national interest by assuring the international community that the United States as a whole honors its commitments to treaty partners and international law...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether the}} anti-commandeering principle of New York v. United States and Printz v. United States applies to exercises of the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Power.</b> It illustrates {{the problem with}} {{an analysis of the}} treaty provision involved in Breard v. Greene, 118 S. Ct. 1352 (1998), which requires state officials to notify certain aliens they arrest that {{they have a right to}} consult with their consul. Whether exercises of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> are subject to the commandeering prohibition depends on the resolution of two ambiguities in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s anti-commandeering doctrine. The first concerns the distinction between commandeering and mere encouragement. Specifically, can a treaty such as the one involved in Breard be upheld as an exercise of conditional preemption, on the theory that it gives the state the choice between providing notification and refraining from arresting aliens? The answer to that question depends on whether a treaty barring states from arresting aliens would be valid, and the answer to that question turns on where the line falls between commandeering and valid preemption. If, as some lower courts have found, Printz and New York prohibit legislation that imposes obligations on states but not individuals, or regulates the states in their roles as governments, then a treaty barring the arrest of aliens would contravene the anti-commandeering principle. But, if so, the anti-commandeering principle could not be applicable to the <b>treaty</b> <b>power,</b> as it would call into question too much Supreme Court precedent. If the anti-commandeering principle is narrower, there would appear to be no reason to exempt the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Power</b> from its scope. Under the narrow interpretation of Printz and New York, the sorts of 2 ̆ 2 obligations 2 ̆ 2 to which the treaty-makers would legitimately want to subject the states would be valid 2 ̆ 2 encouragement 2 ̆ 2 under the conditional preemption doctrine.

40|$|The {{orthodox}} {{view that}} states have {{no role in}} U.

Revisionist scholarship, and recent Supreme Court case law, suggest that Congress alone should decide when the states must stay out of foreign relations. In this article, I argue that both the orthodox and revisionist views neglect an alternative basis for a judicial role - the Treaty Clause, enforced through the dormant <b>treaty</b> <b>power.</b> The text, structure, and original understanding of the <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> establish two important principles of continuing validity. First, the President was to have an independent and substantive authority to negotiate on behalf of the United States, the better to secure advantageous treaties and avoid perilous entanglements. Second, state interference with this negotiating authority, even prior to the conclusive adoption of a federal treaty or statute, was unlawful. Treaty Clause exclusivity is best maintained by a judicially-enforced dormant <b>treaty</b> <b>power</b> barring the states from bargaining with foreign powers, including indirect bargaining through measures that are contingent on foreign government policies - such as the Massachusetts law targeting companies doing business with Burma. However, state activities that incidentally have effects overseas would not be precluded, and the jurisprudence must be informed by the original rationales for federal exclusivity and by the President 2 ̆ 7 s discretion to exempt state activities posing no threat to federal functions...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{revival of}} {{federalism}} casts {{doubt on the}} previously unimpeachable power {{of the national government}} to bind its states by treaty, suggesting potential subject-matter, anti-commandeering, and sovereign immunity limits that could impair U. S. obligations under vital trade and human rights treaties. Existing scholarship treats these principles separately and considers them in originalist or other terms, without definitive result. This Article takes a different approach. By assessing all of the doctrines with equal care, but not at daunting length, it permits insight into the common issues involved in determining whether they should be extended to the <b>treaty</b> <b>power.</b> It also demonstrates that international law and constitutional law are not estranged on these questions. Not only does international law require federal states to interpret their constitutions so as to permit adhering to treaties, but the new federalism doctrines show a sensitivity toward preserving adequate means to pursue national and international ends like the <b>treaty</b> <b>power,</b> especially where those means turn on state consent. Finally, the Article develops a treaty-compact device as an innovative tool for dissolving federalism 2 ̆ 7 s constraints. Taking advantage of parallel doctrinal developments that liberate state and national authority relating to foreign and interstate compacts, it demonstrates that combining the use of compacts with treaties offers solutions on each of the new federalism 2 ̆ 7 s fronts. The answer, then, is that federalism does not constrain the <b>treaty</b> <b>power,</b> when the Constitution is read as an organic whole, and interpreted in a fashion in keeping both with international law and the new federalism itself...|$|R
