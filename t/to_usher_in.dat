25|$|The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a {{literary}} genre {{in which a}} heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an angelic interpreter, and an emphasis on end-time events.

Daniel, the book's hero, is a representative apocalyptic seer, {{the recipient of the}} divine revelation. He refused to learn the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and thus surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge.

Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned {{with the opening of the}} Atlantic trade route and the route to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope, both of which bypassed the Mediterranean.
