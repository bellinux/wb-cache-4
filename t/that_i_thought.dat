5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|None {{of us did}} [...] It was just, you know, it's very conceptual.

500|$|... "Angry White Boy Polka", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} {{at the same time}} as the album's parodies.

However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, saying: [...] "the Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments".|$|E
500|$|The Killing Joke is a {{story about}} Batman and the Joker; it isn't about {{anything}} that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, it was something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.|$|E

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. She laughs at the fact that she has cancer, like this was all some really badly written show. Oh wait, it is." ...|$|E

[...] It was really hopeless after that." [...] In losing the race, Hall became the first Oxonian to lose four Boat Races in the 20th century. [...] Jim Railton, writing in The Times summarised the race: [...] "Cambridge beat the Tideway and the Tideway beat Oxford."

500|$|In 1967, Marshall Chess formed Cadet Concept Records as a {{subsidiary}} of Chess Records. The label's first release was the self-titled debut album of the psychedelic band Rotary Connection, whose members Chess described as [...] "the hottest, most avant garde rock guys in Chicago". As {{a result of the}} album's success, Chess felt that he could revive the career of bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf by recording two albums of experimental, psychedelic blues, producing the albums Electric Mud and The Howlin' Wolf Album. [...] Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. According to Muddy Waters, [...] "Quite naturally, I like a good-selling record. I was looking at it because I played for so many of these so-called hippies <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> probably I could reach them." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} other nine Star Trek films, The Undiscovered Country was re-released on DVD as a Special Edition in 2004. Meyer, who stated he dislikes director's cuts, {{nevertheless}} found [...] "a couple of moments <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> were not clear", and re-edited them as [...] "I suddenly saw {{how to make them}} clear." [...] Among the elements added for home video were a briefing with the Federation president where Admiral Cartwright and Colonel West unveil their plan for rescuing Kirk and McCoy, and a scene where Spock and Scott inspect the torpedoes. Some shots were reordered or replaced, with wide-angle shots replacing close angles and vice versa. The special features included a commentary track with Meyer and Flinn, featurettes detailing the special effects, production, and historical inspiration of the film, and a tribute to actor DeForest Kelley.|$|E
500|$|Including his {{stops at}} both two- and {{four-year}} schools, Saban's overall collegiate coaching record was 94–99–4. Including playoffs, his professional football record stands at 97–101–7. Saban had periods of {{success as a}} player and as a coach at the college and professional levels, but his constant moves from job to job eventually came to define him. [...] "I have been known as a peripatetic coach", he said in 1994. [...] "The first time I was called <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a dirty word. I looked it up in the dictionary and found it meant I moved around a lot." [...] Saban was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and, in a surprise move, was added to the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame in 2015. [...] In 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Saban to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011 ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore wrote, [...] "Daniel Craig {{impressed}} me so greatly in his debut outing, Casino Royale, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined {{edge to the}} character <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Sean [...] might just have to move over. Craig's interpretation was like nothing we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted." [...] So impressed was Moore that he chose to buy the DVD. Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, called Casino Royale [...] "a perfect Bond film." ...|$|E

500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with Joel Little, Lorde said that Little's refining of her [...] "raw potential {{to end up}} with [...] " [...] {{was one of the best}} aspects of him. She also views Little as [...] "the only one who was working with electronic music in the way [...] was interested in at the time". Lorde details that her songs are shaped by her lyrics, which she felt as a [...] "more cohesive way of working." [...] She said, [...] "I tend to start with lyrics– sometimes the seed of a song will just be a word <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was rad, one that summed up a particular idea I'd been trying to pin down." [...] Nonetheless, she points out that the songwriting process of [...] "Tennis Court" [...] was different to how she normally writes a song: the lyrics are built on the instant music and beat.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of shooting, Jack Nicholson had {{appeared}} in two films, and had worked with Roger Corman as the lead in The Cry Baby Killer. According to Nicholson, [...] "I went in to the shoot knowing I {{had to be very}} quirky because Roger originally hadn't wanted me. In other words, I couldn't play it straight. So I just did a lot of weird shit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> would make it funny." [...] According to Dick Miller, all of the dialogue between his character and Mel Welles was ad-libbed. During a scene in which writer Charles B. Griffith played a robber, Griffith remembers that [...] "When [...] and I forgot my lines, I improvised a little, but then I was the writer. I was allowed to." [...] However, Welles states that [...] "Absolutely none of it was ad-libbed [...] every word in Little Shop was written by Chuck Griffith, and I did ninety-eight pages of dialogue in two days." ...|$|E
500|$|Campaign {{magazine}} listed [...] "Cog", {{along with}} Balls for the Sony BRAVIA line of high-definition televisions, {{as one of}} the most-imitated commercials in recent times.

When asked about the similarities between [...] "Cog" [...] and [...] "Tipping Point", Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind Tipping Point, replied: [...] "I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, {{you have to look at}} things like that and make a decision.
