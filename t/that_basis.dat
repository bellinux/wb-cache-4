On <b>that</b> <b>basis</b> the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E

The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E

5|$|The work {{is thought}} to have been {{completed}} as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait was examined by the art dealer Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of Jane, had it verified and on <b>that</b> <b>basis</b> negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured £100,000. The historian David Starkey was highly critical of the sale and challenged Foley's identifications.|$|E
5|$|A {{copyright}} issue arose {{after the}} publication of letters written by Helena's sister, Princess Alice. In Germany, an edition of Alice's letters was published in 1883, by a Darmstadt clergyman called Carl Sell, who chose a selection of her letters made available to him by the Queen. When it was done, Helena wrote to Sell and requested permission to publish the German text into English, and it was granted, but without the knowledge of the publisher Dr Bergsträsser. In December 1883 Helena wrote to Sir Theodore Martin, a favoured royal biographer, informing him that Bergsträsser was claiming copyright of Alice's letters, and on <b>that</b> <b>basis</b> was demanding a delay in the publication of the English edition. Martin acted as an intermediary between Helena and Bergsträsser, who claimed to have received many offers from English publishers, and that the chosen one would expect a high honorarium.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} Guam, Chataan continued {{toward the}} northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000UTC on July8, the typhoon {{reached its peak}} intensity of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute sustained) while located near the Japanese island of Okinotorishima. The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained) about six hours earlier; on <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> the agency classified {{the system as a}} super typhoon. On July8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18hours. On July9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530UTC on July10, Chataan made landfall on the Bōsō Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100km/h (65mph 10-minute sustained). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200UTC on July11; this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28years. A few hours later, Chataan became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Okhotsk, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July13 near Sakhalin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the surface}} low {{pressure}} center dissipated, {{the remnants of}} Mitch maintained a circulation aloft that reached the Bay of Campeche on November2. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November3, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60mph (95km/h). On <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> the NHC began reissuing advisories on Mitch about 55mi (90km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon reforming, Mitch was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November4, Mitch made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40mph (65km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, {{including}} HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While {{they were}} en route, the Métis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December. Meetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation {{took place on}} 5 and 6 January 1870, but when these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in a public forum. Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 January, leading Riel to propose {{the formation of a}} new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on <b>that</b> <b>basis.</b> The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled New Nation and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws.|$|E

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on <b>that</b> <b>basis.</b> During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E
5|$|In Mendeleev's 1871 {{periodic}} table, copper, silver, {{and gold}} are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the iron triad and platinum group metals), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised {{to note that}} it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due {{to the existence of}} copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time. However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{marriage}} of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed {{at the lack of}} a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother Arthur (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a valid marriage. Her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, Julius II, on <b>that</b> <b>basis.</b> Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had surrounded and occupied Rome in the War of the League of Cognac.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1941, the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard structure for the military organisation of the resistance. The General Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the General Staff. The basic Partisan unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the Partisan forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment staff would be directly responsible to the General Staff. On <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> the existing Partisan units operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten detachments, six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and detachments in those regions were placed under the direct control of the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|On September10, a {{tropical}} disturbance persisted within the {{intertropical convergence zone}} near Pohnpei. When the Hurricane Hunters approached the system at 02:00UTC on September11, they observed a center with several small circulations about 130km (80mi) east of Guam. On <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> the Joint Typhoon Warning Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Sarah. The depression passed near or just north of Guam, as tracked by radar. By late on September11, the Hurricane Hunters were reporting flight-level winds of 95km/h (60mph). Early on September12, the JTWC upgraded Sarah to {{a tropical}} storm after the circulation became better defined. The storm exhibited a parabolic trajectory that was slightly {{to the west of}} the typical September storm. It moved westward initially but gradually curved to the northwest. A Hurricane Hunters flight at 14:15UTC on September12 observed a 65km (40mi) eye diameter, prompting the JTWC to upgrade Sarah further to typhoon status, with maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph).|$|E

5|$|The Legend of Korra is set {{to music}} by Jeremy Zuckerman, who {{previously}} wrote the music for Avatar: The Last Airbender with Benjamin Wynn. For The Legend of Korra, Zuckerman is the sole composer while Wynn is the lead sound designer; the two collaborate with Foley artist Aran Tanchum and showrunner Mike DiMartino on the soundscape of the series. Konietzko and DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On <b>that</b> <b>basis,</b> Zuckerman composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration. It is performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments, including a dizi (flute), paigu (drums), a guqin and a Mongolian matouqin.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} events that caused Kean to change the {{direction}} of DeChow's attack toward Komam-ni began at 01:00, September 3. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea. Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion had the advantage of calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on <b>that</b> <b>basis</b> estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men. The 35th units also had the advantage of well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on <b>that</b> <b>basis</b> hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
