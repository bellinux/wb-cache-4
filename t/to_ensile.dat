40|$|One {{strain of}} Lactobacillus brevis and four strains of Lactobacillus buchneri are each {{intended}} to improve ensiling at proposed doses ranging from 5 × 107 to 1 × 108 CFU/kg fresh material. Both bacterial species are considered by EFSA to {{be suitable for}} the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment. As the identity of all strains was clearly established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, {{the use of these}} strains in silage production is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals and the environment. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents and the high dusting potential of the products tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat these additives as skin and respiratory sensitisers.

40|$|The {{strain of}} Lactobacillus plantarum is {{intended}} to improve the ensiling process at proposed doses ranging from 1  x  108 to 1  x  109 CFU/kg fresh material. This speciesis considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, for consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. The active agent is not an eye or skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the product tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a respiratory sensitiser. A total of 20 laboratory-scale ensiling studies were conducted with L. plantarum applied at 1 x 109 or 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, forage containing the additive was compared with untreated control materials, and the duration of the studies was at least 90 days. L. plantarum has the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing lactic acid content and the preservation of dry matter, by reducing the pH and protein degradation. This was demonstrated in a range of easy and moderately difficult <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> forage materials at a minimum concentration of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material and also in difficult <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> forage materials when added at a concentration of 1 x 109 CFU/kg fresh material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the ability for early-harvested Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus and Miscanthus sacchariflorus) to be stored in silage for later use in anaerobic digestion. Two silage additives favouring a homo and hetero-fermentation pathway were examined. The results show that silage additives are necessary <b>to</b> effectively <b>ensile</b> Miscanthus, otherwise untreated Miscanthus grasses incurred dry matter losses of 4 % during three months' storage. The silage additives improved the lactic and acetic acid production in the Miscanthus silages however {{did not have any}} effect on the biogas yield. On a ‘per tonne volatile solids’-basis, Miscanthus produces half the biogas yield of maize. The outlook for the use of Miscanthus AD therefore depends on the yield when harvested in autumn.

40|$|Sawdust-based Spent Lentinula Edodes Substrate (SLES) is an {{important}} agricultural waste resource for itsâ huge production amount, on the other hand, {{it is hard to}} recycling because of the low digestibility. For the purpose of recycling the SLES, a study was conducted to improve the feeding values of SLES via microbial inoculation. The SLES was ensiled with 0. 5 % (v/w) Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB, Lactobacillus plantarum) or 0. 5 % (v/w) yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for 15 days. Four treatments were made included 100 % SLES (control), 99 % SLES + 0. 5 % LAB (T 1), 99 % SLES + 0. 5 % yeast (T 2) and 99 % SLES + 0. 5 % LAB + 0. 5 % yeast (T 3). Compared with the raw SLES (not fermentation), 100 % SLES (control) after ensiling showed higher (p< 0. 05) pH (5. 47) and lower lactic acid production. The addition of microbe to the SLES improved most of the physical parameters, fermentation parameters and microbial populations compared to the control experiments. On the other hand, microbial-blending to SLES decreased most of the chemical parameters except for the Crude Protein (CP). Compared <b>to</b> the raw, <b>ensile</b> fermentation would increase the amino acids and microbial inoculants to the SLES could increase the total amount of amino acids further and the most abundant component of essential-amino acid and non-essential amino acid were valine and glutamate, respectively. Among the four ensile treatments, the impact of the addition of 0. 5 % LAB and 0. 5 % yeast (T 3) on the SLES storage and feeding value was the greatest one (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: Legumes {{are more}} highly {{buffered}} than grasses and are consequently more difficult <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> satisfactorily. Therefore this study designed {{to examine the}} inclusion effect of molasses on silage quality of alfalfa, sorghum forage (Abu 70) and there mixture silage pH, dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and gas production were determined. Dry matter and crude protein contents were increased by molasses inclusion in both grass and legume silages. However, protein content increased by molasses inclusion in legume and legume mixed silage. In conclusion, molasses inclusion leads to an improvement in silage quality through the drop in silage pH and increases of total gas production in all types of silage even legumes...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of acetic acid as the chemical conservant in three doses (4, 6 8 g/kg green mass) on {{the intensity of}} fermentation and proteolysis in lucerne silage was investigated. On the basis of chemical analysis, {{it was found that}} with the increase of conservant dose the pH value decreased aminogenesis and nitrogen solubility was limited. In silages treated the absolute and relative domination of acetic acid was found in total acid content. The increase of free and bonded acetic acid was discovered with the increase of conservant dose. Free butyric acid was not detected, while bonded butyric acid was present in negligible concentration, without effect on silage quality. Compared to control silage (III quality class according to DLG and Zelter method), a significant increase of acetic acid in silages resulted in the decline of their quality, and they were ranked as not useful (V quality class according to DLG method), or on the margin of usefulness (IV quality class according to Zelter method).

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{assess the}} {{potential}} use of both softwood and hardwood bark broiler litters as a feedstuff for ruminants, the nutrient composition and in vitro digestibility for both raw and ensiled bark litters were chemically evaluated and compared to softwood planer shavings broiler litter. Each bark type was either processed or used directly {{as it came}} from the rosserhead debarker. Ensiling studies showed the lactic acid content was higher for hardwood bark litters than for softwood planer shavings. Softwood bark litter contained the least amount of lactic acid after fermentation in mini-silos. In vitro dry matter digestibility was higher for hardwood bark litters than for softwood bark litters or softwood planer shavings. No difference in in vitro dry matter digestibility was observed between raw and ensiled bark litter. No differences in ash, phosphorus, ether extract, nitrogen, total energy, and acid detergent fiber content were observed among the litters tested. The pH. of ensiled hardwood bark was lower than ensiled softwood bark. Results indicate that from a nutritive standpoint, bark litters are potentially useful as a ruminant feed. Hardwood bark litter also appears <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> better and to be more digestible and possibly more nutritious than softwood bark and softwood planer shavings litter...|$|E
40|$|An idea {{of using}} biomass for {{generating}} electricity and heat leads to new solutions for power generators, adapted to be supplied with gaseous and liquid biofuels. At present, {{there is a growing}} interest in low-power generators. This type of energy production is termed ‘scattered energy generation’. It is expected that generating energy in small units situated close to energy consumers may bring about substantial benefits. It is assumed that in a scattered energy generation system, energy will be produced from local fuels, such as broadly understood biomass as a primary component for production of gaseous and liquid biofuels to power low-power energy generators. An adequate amount of biomass must be secured to ensure that biogas can be produced all year round. The easiest way to store highly efficient biomass is <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> maize and rye as well as grass. The amounts of biogas obtained from these two types of silage are comparable. Using rye as a renewable energy source for production of either bioethanol or biogas is economically viable for at least two reasons: rye grows on poor class soils and rye cultivation technology can be reduced to just nitrogen fertilization. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to generate energy in Poland in scattered energy generation systems from crops grown for this purpose. Currently, gas-powered engines are being in several ways...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} effect of the replacement of aruana grass by gliricidia on the fermentative losses, chemical composition, and aerobic stability of silages. For ensiling, whole-crop aruana grass (75 d of growth) was chopped (275 g kg- 1 dry matter - DM) and ensiled alone or associated with gliricidia (270 g kg- 1 DM; 150 d of growth). For gliricidia, we used only the leaves and stalks <b>to</b> <b>ensile.</b> The evaluated treatments were different ratios of aruana grass to gliricidia (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100), with four replicates (mini-silos). The silage composed only of gliricidia exhibited a lower pH than the other silages. Dry matter recovery was not affected by the treatments, although effluent losses were affected. The replacement of aruana grass by gliricidia 50 % at ensiling resulted in a higher lactic acid bacteria count. The aruana grass silages displayed lower protein contents and a higher neutral detergent fiber content than the gliricidia silages after 40 d of fermentation. Consequently, the silage consisting of 100 % gliricidia showed higher in vitro DM digestibility, presenting an increase of 8. 13 % after 40 d of fermentation compared with 100 % of aruana grass silage. After silo opening, the gliricidia silage was very stable (> 72 h). The low quality of aruana grass silage is improved by replacing this grass with significant amounts of gliricidia (approximately 75 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{strains of}} Pediococcus pentosaceus are each {{intended}} {{to improve the}} ensiling process at a dose of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh matter. This speciesis considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strains has been established and as no resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance was detected, the use of the strains in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. In the absence of evidence, these additives should be regarded as skin and eye irritants and potential skin sensitisers. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat these additives as respiratory sensitisers. Given the high dusting potential of the preparations tested, there is the need to take measures to minimise inhalation exposure of workers. Eight studies with laboratory-scale silos were conducted with P. pentosaceus applied at 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, which lasted for at least 90 days, the effects of adding the additive to forage were compared to untreated control materials. All three strains of P. pentosaceus have the potential to improve the production of silage by reducing the pH and increasing lactic acid concentration, resulting in an increased preservation of dry matter.

40|$|Enterococcus faecium is a {{technological}} additive intended {{to improve the}} ensiling process at a proposed dose of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. It is not expected {{that the use of}} E. faecium at the dose proposed would substantially increase the exposure to this species of animals given silage as part of their rations Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that use of this strain in the preparation of silage is safe for the target animals. Since the strain does not belong to the hospital-associated clade and does not express resistance to the antibiotics tested, use of this strain in animal nutrition is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. The material safety data sheet proposed indicates that preparations containing the strain may cause irritation upon contact with skin and eyes. The dustiness of the preparation tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly.

40|$|Grass {{samples were}} {{harvested}} during the 1993 growing season after a precut on April 27, 1993 and were stored frozen or left <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> in 30 -L buckets. Effects on chemical composition and fermentation kinetics of the maturation {{of the grass}} and of ensiling were investigated. Chemical composition and fermentation kinetics were determined using the gas production technique, in vitro techniques, and the nylon bag technique. Two silage samples were also investigated in vivo. Maturation caused a decrease in crude protein content and organic matter degradability {{and an increase in}} neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and lignin contents. Degradation rates were highest for the youngest samples and decreased as grass and silage matured. This result could be observed from the first derivative of the cumulative gas production curves (i. e., the rate of gas production) and from the gas production parameters. The rate of degradation of the nonsoluble fraction of the young samples, determined using the gas production technique, was relatively higher in rumen fluid from a cow fed silage from grass cut at a young stage. More mature samples were degraded relatively faster in rumen fluid from a cow fed mature grass silage, suggesting a specific adaptation of the rumen microorganisms to the grass properties. There was a good relationship among the second phase of gas production (i. e., fermentation of the nonsoluble fraction), maturity of the grass and grass silage samples, degradability determined with the Tilley and Terry technique, and degradability determined after 46 h of incubation in rumen fluid. Results obtained with both of the different in vitro techniques and the nylon bag technique were confirmed by the in vivo experiments involving the two silage samples...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{to increase the}} metabolisable energy (ME) yield of pastures has been {{the development of a}} genetic engineering technology which increases the leaf lipid content and biomass production of perennial ryegrass (PRG). Outdoor plot/feeding trials of genetically engineered crops are prohibited under the current New Zealand (NZ) regulatory framework. However, this high lipid PRG may become available to farmers and eventually be used to make silage, which could fulfill an important role as a high ME, inexpensive, supplementary feed for livestock. Ensiling preserves a crop’s nutrients at a high moisture content and at a low pH, by microbial fermentation of plant sugars into lactic acid under anaerobic conditions. In a preliminary investigation into the ensiling biochemistry of this high lipid PRG, glasshouse-grown materials were wilted and inoculated, and then ensiled on a miniature scale. A series of method development ensiling experiments revealed that non-transgenic PRG grown in glasshouse conditions during the NZ spring/summer was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> naturally, due to its low water soluble sugar to buffering capacity ratio. In order to generate well-preserved silage in the main experiment, glucose was added (post-harvest) to a non-transgenic PRG genotype (WT) and two transgenic PRG genotypes containing ‘medium’ and ‘high’ leaf lipid levels (ML and HL). The HL plants produced 51 % more dry biomass than WT during the regrowth period. Pre-ensiled HL had 31 % higher fatty acid content, 70 % higher nitrate content and a 17 % lower water soluble sugar to crude protein ratio than WT. ML was intermediate. The glasshouse growth environment resulted in an atypical overall PRG nutritional composition. WT, ML and HL underwent a similar fermentation, and nutrients were well-preserved. The nutritional differences in the ensiled material largely reflected those in their fresh counterparts, although a longer wilt caused greater overall digestible nutrient losses in HL. In an in vitro rumen incubation experiment the fatty acids in HL silage exhibited less complete biohydrogenation than in fresh and ensiled WT. Experiments using a range of high lipid PRG lines grown in a range of environments will be needed to validate these results...|$|E

The {{effect of}} harvest date and {{inoculation}} on the yield, fermentation characteristics and feeding value of kale silage. ? Grass and Forage Science, 56, (2), 151 - 161. Sponsorship: UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Milk Development Council. Using new harvesting and ensiling technologies, {{it is now}} possible <b>to</b> <b>ensile</b> kale (Brassica oleracea) successfully. However, there is little information available regarding the optimum time for harvest. The aim of this 2 -year study was to compare the yield, fermentation characteristics and feeding value of kale harvested at different stages of growth, and ensiled with and without a bacterial inoculant. During Year 1 the crop was harvested after 15, 18 and 20 weeks of growth. The yield at each harvest was similar, but as the crop matured the crude protein (CP) concentration and buffering capacity decreased significantly, and there was a marked increase in the water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentration. During Year 2 the crop was harvested at 14 and 17 weeks of growth. Again, the stage of maturity did not affect yield and, on this occasion, the chemical composition of the crop was unaffected by harvest date. However, the WSC and CP concentrations of the crop were lower in Year 2 than in Year 1, possibly as a result of differences in fertilizer regime. Each of the silages produced in Year 2 was offered to six Suffolk cross wether lambs, aged 10 months, to measure voluntary intake, in vivo digestibility and nitrogen retention. Neither harvesting date nor the use of an inoculant affected voluntary intake or nitrogen retention by the lambs. However, in vivo digestibility was higher in the kale silage harvested after 14 weeks of growth and when an inoculant was applied. The results obtained suggest that harvesting kale after 14 weeks of growth can produce highly digestible silage with a high CP concentration. Although delaying harvest until 18 weeks of growth will probably result in a decrease in the CP concentration of the crop, it should also lead to an increase in the WSC concentration of the crop, ensuring a more reliable fermentation.
