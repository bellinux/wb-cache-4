50|$|It was {{determined}} that the tunnel would be redundant to the existing Hultman Aqueduct by connecting Shaft C on the existing Cosgrove Tunnel in the west with Shaft 5 on the existing City Tunnel, and with the Weston Aqueduct Terminal Chamber Area in the east end.

Additional major connections to existing MWRA transmission facilities resulted in Shaft E, Shaft L, Shaft NW and Shaft NE.

5000|$|ETCO {{released}} a technical report detailing results of comparative testing conducted at their R&D facility. This report titled “Under the Boot” was published {{after a series}} of consumer complaints, research and articles involving Coil on Plug ignition systems. There were also Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by automobile manufacturers from automotive manufacturers including Acura/Honda that caused the company to release the white paper on this research. The main focus of the research looked at the spring like connection devices. The connection devices used to supply the current's path from coil to plug were not as robust as the [...] "mated fit" [...] terminal to <b>terminal</b> <b>connections</b> required on wired ignition systems. These Coil on Plug devices do not have the retention values demanded by SAE ( [...] Society Automotive Engineers [...] ) Standard J2032 3.2.1 for High Voltage Ignition cable assemblies. Proponents of Coil on Plug technology cite cost and ease of use as primary advantages when compared to standard wire assemblies.|$|E
50|$|Along with {{dramatic}} advances in satellite technology {{over the past}} decade, ground equipment has similarly evolved, benefiting from higher levels of integration and increasing processing power, expanding both capacity and performance boundaries.The Gateway—or Gateway Earth Station (its full name)—is {{also referred to as}} a ground station, teleport or hub. The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components. In short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the subscriber terminal. Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.The system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for subscriber <b>terminal</b> <b>connections</b> to the Internet.In the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Because of the satellite's geostationary orbit, the gateway antenna can stay pointed at a fixed position.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to experimentally characterize factors that can cause electrical failures (i. e., overheating connections), to assess the damage and potential forensic signatures of these failures, and to characterize the similarities and differences between arcing and melting in receptacle components and wiring. Laboratory testing evaluated the impact {{of a wide range of}} variables on the formation of overheating connections in residential duplex receptacles including screw terminal torque, wiring method (back-wired, or side-wired), and primary receptacle materials. A total of 408 trials of receptacles with various <b>terminal</b> <b>connections</b> were tested in the laboratory setting; receptacles were powered for up to 16 months. A small portion of receptacles with loose connections overheated to the point of failure of the receptacle; some including flaming events. Failure events occurred between 5 and 365 days after tests were started. Four hundred and sixty eight (468) receptacles were placed in compartment fire tests and furnace fire tests. These tests were designed to evaluate the persistence after fire exposure of overheating/arcing evidence from failure events (i. e., from potential fire cause events). The fire exposure tests also served to analyze the characteristic traits of arcing and melting damage. The results indicated that only very loose connections (less than 0. 339 N-m [3 in-lb]) at moderately high currents (9 A or higher) tend to form significant overheating connections and receptacle failures, irrespective of other variables such as receptacle materials and installation. Characteristic indicators of overheating and glowing <b>terminal</b> <b>connections</b> were identified and were found to persist after fire exposure...|$|E
