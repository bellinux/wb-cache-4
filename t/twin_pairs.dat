5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical <b>twin</b> <b>pairs</b> but not among fraternal <b>twin</b> <b>pairs.</b> The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

Observations We describe a unique <b>twin</b> <b>pair</b> who spent not only their first 2 decades of life together but also in their later decades had the same type of job at the same latitude, resulting in well-matched levels of significant sun exposure. However, the twins differed markedly in regard to smoking history; the twin with an approximately 52. 59 ̆ 6 pack-year smoking history showed more severe skin aging than did the nonsmoking twin.

25|$|Direct {{comparisons}} of identical twins constitute an optimal model for interrogating environmental epigenetics. In {{the case of}} humans with different environmental exposures, monozygotic (identical) twins were epigenetically indistinguishable during their early years, while older twins had remarkable differences in the overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation. The <b>twin</b> <b>pairs</b> who had spent less of their lifetime together and/or had greater differences in their medical histories were those who showed the largest differences in their levels of 5-methylcytosine DNA and acetylation of histones H3 and H4.|$|E

Those who volunteer to studies are not even representative of separated twins in general since not all separated twins agree to be part of twin studies.|$|E
25|$|Livesley et al. concluded, in {{agreement}} with other studies, that narcissism as measured by a standardized test was a common inherited trait. Additionally, in similar agreement with those other studies, {{it was found that}} there exists a continuum between normal and disordered personality. The study subjects were 175 volunteer <b>twin</b> <b>pairs</b> (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the heritability of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of genetic and environmental causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the concordance of this trait in the identical twins was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability coefficients of greater than 0.5: callousness, identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.|$|E

40|$|Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is {{a chronic}} {{myeloproliferative}} disorder in human bone marrow. Over 50 % {{of patients with}} myelofibrosis have mutations in JAK 2, MPL, or CALR. However, these mutations are rarely detected in children, suggesting {{a difference in the}} pathogenesis of childhood PMF. In this study, we investigated the response to drug treatment of a monozygotic <b>twin</b> <b>pair</b> with typical childhood PMF. The twin exhibited different clinical outcomes despite following the same treatment regimen. The transcriptomic profiles of patient samples after drug treatment (E 2 and Y 2) were significantly different between the <b>twin</b> <b>pair,</b> which is consistent with the observation that the drug treatment was effective only in the younger brother, despite the twin being genetically identical. Bioinformatics analysis of the drug-responsive genes showed that the JAK-STAT pathway was activated in the cured younger brother, which is opposite to the pathway inhibition observed in adult PMF cases following treatment. Moreover, apoptosis and cell cycle processes were both significantly influenced by drug treatment in the sample of younger brother (Y 2), implying their potential association with the pathogenesis of childhood PMF. Gene mutations in JAK 2, MPL, or CALR were not observed; however, mutations in genes including SRSF 2 and SF 3 B 1 occurred in this <b>twin</b> <b>pair</b> with childhood PMF. Gene fusion events were extensively screened in the <b>twin</b> <b>pair</b> samples and the occurrence of IGLV 2 - 14 -IGLL 5 gene fusion was confirmed.
