5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E

Travelers {{must have a}} passport that is valid {{for at least six}} months and a visa to enter Bahrain.

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were generally}} praised by critics. GameSpot's Andrew Park stated that virtually {{everything in the}} PC version [...] "looks bright, colorful and clean" [...] when playing in 3D-accelerated mode, but called its texturing minimal. GameSpot's Ben Stahl also called the N64 version's track design [...] "innovative and cute", as well as saying the tracks and backgrounds have a [...] "somewhat real look" [...] <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to tell where the player should be driving. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the game's background animations, stating that they not only [...] "add to {{the atmosphere of the}} game, but also affect the way it plays". However, some reviewers criticised the game's performance, with IGN's Sam Bishop stating that the PlayStation version's load times between levels are horrendous and Next Generation Chris Charla calling the N64 version's framerate [...] "nauseatingly slow". Conversely, IGN's Winnie Imperio called the N64 version's framerate [...] "consistent, if not entirely smooth".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. <b>That</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E

[...] It's an instrumental, it was a real collaboration and it just kind of came out of us in the studio, real improvised natural music, very simple. I think it's beautiful.

2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown on April 10, {{at which time}} the {{controls}} were demonstrated. IGN were impressed; [...] "The pointing function works really well in Scarface. Just like the PC version's mouse control, players now have near pin-point weapon precision <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> and more intuitive to gun down the opposition with the huge assortment of firepower within the experience. You can still target individuals to tighten up your aim using the Z button on the nunchuk, but because the Wii Remote's pointer already {{does a great job}} with its precision it's rare that we found ourselves using it." [...] GameSpot were less impressed; [...] "When you're wielding the chainsaw, its movement will be tied to that of the Wii Remote, and by slashing in different directions and at different heights you'll be able to target enemies' heads, legs, and individual arms. With practice you'll purportedly be able to remove all of the aforementioned extremities before the torso hits the ground, but the associate producer showing us the game on this occasion never managed to pull it off." ...|$|E
