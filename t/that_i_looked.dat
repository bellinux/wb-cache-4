500|$|The album's themes {{revolve around}} events {{which took place}} in 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's {{handling}} of the United Kingdom general election, {{as well as on the}} state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E
500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E
500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. I had to look out the porthole and have a weep. As I was doing <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> out and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bobo chic was {{associated}} {{in particular with}} punks in the SoHo area of Lower Manhattan, {{to the south of}} Greenwich Village. It was described by a student fashion writer as [...] "paying to look poor" [...] and having been [...] "made popular by silver screen stars who all look like they got dressed in the dark like the Olsen twins, Kirsten Dunst and Chloë Sevigny". In 2008 English actress Sophie Winkleman, who had attended Cambridge University in the 1990s, remarked wryly that she had [...] "wor floaty dresses at university ... thinking <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> poetic and wistful. I actually looked homeless". Another British commentator referred to Mary-Kate Olsen's [...] "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to dressing", but noted that, by 2006, the Olsens' merchandising empire was recording annual sales of £500 million.|$|E
2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he sighed, [...] "that terrible Press of ours! They told you, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was hard, unscrupulous, unforgiving, a money-making machine, and all {{the rest}} of it. Do you think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> like <b>that,</b> Virginia?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked so}} attentively at me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> attentively {{at him and}} felt sure I {{understood}} him.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked from}} one to the other. I have no doubt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> as bewildered as I felt.|$|E
60|$|Bewildered, horrified, {{stunned by}} this cruel perversion, I could not speak. But I trust <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> innocent, being so.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] {{the gentleman}} said, scrutinizing him closely. [...] "I see you look sunburned and weather-beaten now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at you; but somehow I {{should not have}} put you down as a sailor." ...|$|R

60|$|There was no disputing {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> most disgustingly like Clark when I {{got into his}} clothes. I {{actually}} felt a grudge against them for their excellent fit.|$|E
60|$|My father said, this morning, when my {{face was}} in repose and thoughtful, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{precisely}} as young Edward Twichell of Hartford used to look some is months ago--chin, mouth, forehead, expression--everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you, indeed?" [...] {{the young}} lady said, in surprise. [...] "Yes, and now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> close at you, I {{recognize}} your face. Poor boy, how have you got into a strait like this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! He's {{a curious}} animal and seems remarkably small, now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at him. No {{one would think}} of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me," [...] {{continued}} the Lion sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder, uncle, that aunt is shaken, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> pale. For John, and I, and Jonas {{were taken}} captives by the Romans, who carried us off to sell as slaves, leaving poor mother behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! clever, clever!" [...] muttered Hans in {{involuntary}} admiration, [...] "and {{to think}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> and looked too low, beneath the reed. Oh! Hans, {{though you are}} old, you have much to learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|Townshead nodded. [...] "Still, he was correct. I don't mind admitting <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{forward to}} your visit with apprehension, but I now fancy {{you will not}} jar upon me so much as I expected." ...|$|E
6000|$|I almost gaped--by which I mean <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> as if I did--for surprise. [...] "You {{agree that}} it's not she----?" [...] Then, as she again waited, [...] "It's you who've come round?" [...] I insisted.|$|E

6000|$|... "You know," [...] he said roughly, [...] "how I {{hate you}} {{to mix with}} that rowdy lot like you do; and you know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> on the csárdás as indecent and vulgar. Why do you do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I suppose <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> just as I felt--somewhat dubious {{owing to}} the {{lateness}} of the hour and {{the darkness of the}} night, not to speak of the abominable weather, for he continued with marked impatience: ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{imperfect}} {{was this}} {{realization of the}} first of my great expectations, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. [...] "Ah!" [...] said he, mistaking me; [...] "the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me." ...|$|E
