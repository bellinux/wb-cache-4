5000|$|<b>Thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> (...) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{conversion}} of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).

50|$|In {{contrast}} to uracil, thymine bases are found mostly in DNA, not RNA. Cells do not normally contain thymine bases that {{are linked to}} ribose sugars in RNA, thus indicating that cells only synthesize deoxyribose-linked thymine. The enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> is responsible for synthesizing thymine residues from dUMP to dTMP. This reaction transfers a methyl group onto the uracil base of dUMP to generate dTMP. The thymidylate synthase reaction, dUMP + 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate â‡” dTMP + dihydrofolate, is shown to the right.|$|E
50|$|To supply deoxynucleotides for viral {{production}} in the low proliferating host cells, large DNA viruses possess genes to encode deoxynucleotide synthesis enzymes themselves.

40|$|A {{homology}} {{search of}} proteins predicted from the recently reported complete DNA sequence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) {{revealed that the}} product of gene 13 was highly homologous to eukaryotic and prokaryotic <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetases</b> (TSs). The VZV protein was {{shown to be a}} TS by three functional tests. Firstly, a plasmid esigned to express the native protein was able to complement a strain of Escherichia coil in which the natural TS gene is deleted. Secondly, in an enzyme assay for TS, extracts of the complemented strain were capable of releasing tritiated water from 2 '-deoxy[5 - 3 H]uridylate. Thirdly, these extracts contained a protein that bound isotopically labelled 5 -fluoro- 2 '-deoxyuridylate, ligand specific for the active site of TS. In addition, a novel ligand-binding protein was detected in human cells infected with VZV. Two common human diseases, chickenpox and shingles, are caused by varicella-zoster vi us (VZV). This virus {{is a member of the}} Alphaherpesvirinae, a subfamily of the Herpesviridae typified by the most extensively studied human herpesvirus, herpes implex virus type 1 (HSV- 1).

40|$|A large {{variety of}} 5 -substituted 2 'deoxyuridines (dUrds) and 2 '-deoxyuridylates (dUMPs) have been {{evaluated}} for their inhibitory effects on the thymidine (dThd) kinase or <b>thymidylate</b> (dTMP) <b>synthetase</b> isolated from mouse leukemia L 1210 cells. The most potent inhibitors of dThd kinase were 5 -chloro-, 5 -bromo- and 5 -iodo-dUrd. Their Ki/Km values ranged from 0. 57 to 0. 82. All dUrd analogs tested showed competitive kinetics with respect to dThd. However, there was little, if any, correlation between the inhibitory effects of the compounds on L 1210 cell growth and their inhibitory activities against dThd kinase (r = 0. 16). The most potent inhibitors of dTMP synthetase were (in order of decreasing activity) : 5 -nitro-dUMP greater than 5 -formyl-dUMP greater than 5 -fluoro-dUMP greater than 5 -oxime of 5 -formyl-dUMP greater than 5 -azidomethyl-dUMP greater than (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) -dUMP. The ki/Km values for these compounds ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 665. All dUMP analogs tested showed competitive kinetics with respect to dUMP (if not preincubated with the enzyme at 37 degrees). There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 833) between the inhibitory effects of these compounds on L 1210 cell growth and their inhibitory activities against dTMP synthetase. Thus, the suppressive action of 5 -substituted dUrd derivatives on tumor cell growth would involve prior conversion of the nucleoside analogs to the corresponding 5 '-monophosphates followed by an inhibition of dTMP synthetase. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Floxuridine {{is rapidly}} catabolized to 5-fluorouracil, {{which is the}} active form of the drug. The primary effect is {{interference}} with DNA synthesis {{and to a lesser}} extent, inhibition of RNA formation through the drug's incorporation into RNA, thus leading to the production of fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits uracil riboside phosphorylase, which prevents the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. As well, the monophosphate of floxuridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) inhibits the enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase.</b> This leads to the inhibition of methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thus interfering with DNA synthesis.|$|E
50|$|B {{virus is}} {{approximately}} 200 nm {{in diameter and}} has a structure almost identical to that of HSV1 and HSV2. It has an icosahedral capsid (T=16) which consists of 150 hexons and 12 pentons, formed from 6 proteins. The envelope is loose around the viral capsid and contains at least 10 glycoproteins which are critical for adsorption and penetration into host cells. The tegument containing at least 14 viral proteins lies between the capsid and the envelope. The tegument proteins are involved in nucleic acid metabolism, DNA synthesis and processing of proteins. The proteins in the tegument are thymidine kinase, <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase,</b> dUTPase, ribonuclease reductase, DNA polymerase, DNA Helicase, DNA Primase and Protein Kinases.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{fluorouracil}} (5-FU) destroys AKs {{by blocking}} methylation of <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase,</b> thereby interrupting DNA and RNA synthesis. This in turn prevents {{the proliferation of}} dysplastic cells in AK. Topical 5-FU is the most utilized treatment for AK, and often results in effective removal of the lesion. Overall, there is a 50% efficacy rate resulting in 100% clearance of AKs treated with topical 5-FU. 5-FU may be up to 90% effective in treating non-hyperkeratotic lesions. The most commonly used application regimen consists of applying a layer of topical cream to the lesion twice a day after washing; duration of treatment is typically 2-4 weeks, but treatment of up to 8 weeks has demonstrated a higher cure rate.|$|E
40|$|Transformed {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by imbalances in metabolic routes. In particular, different key enzymes of nucleotide metabolism and DNA biosynthesis, such as CTP <b>synthetase,</b> <b>thymidylate</b> synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, IMP dehydrogenase, ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase, and DNA methyltransferase, are markedly up-regulated in certain tumor cells. Together with the concomitant down-modulation of the purine and pyrimidine degradation enzymes, the increased anabolic propensity supports the excessive proliferation of transformed cells. However, many types of cancer cells have maintained the ability to differentiate terminally into mature, non-proliferating cells not only in response to physiological receptor ligands, such as retinoic acid, vitamin D metabolites, and cytokines, but also following exposure {{to a wide variety}} of non-physiological agents such as antimetabolites. Interestingly, induction of tumor cell differentiation is often associated with reversal of the transformation-related enzyme deregulations. An important class of differentiating compounds comprises the antimetabolites of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis, the majority being structural analogs of natural nucleosides. The CTP synthetase inhibitors cyclopentenylcytosine and 3 -deazauridine, the thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5 -fluoro- 2 '-deoxyuridine, the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor methotrexate, the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors tiazofurin, ribavirin, 5 -ethynyl- 1 -beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole- 4 -carboxamide (EICAR) and mycophenolic acid, the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors hydroxyurea and deferoxamine, and the DNA polymerase inhibitors ara-C, 9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxyethyl) adenine (PMEA), and aphidicolin, as well as several nucleoside analogs perturbing the DNA methylation pattern, have been found to induce tumor cell differentiation through impairment of DNA synthesis and/or function. Thus, by selectively targeting those anabolic enzymes that contribute to the neoplastic behavior of cancer cells, the normal cellular differentiation program may be reactivated and the malignant phenotype suppressed. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|KSHV is a herpesvirus, {{and is a}} large {{double-stranded}} DNA virus with {{a protein}} covering that packages its nucleic acids, called the capsid, which is then surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the tegument, and finally enclosed in a lipid envelope derived {{in part from the}} cell membrane. KSHV has a genome which is approximately 165,000 nucleic acid bases in length. It is a rhadinovirus, and is remarkable since it has stolen numerous genes from host cells including genes that encode for complement-binding protein, IL-6, BCL-2, cyclin-D, a G protein-coupled receptor, interferon regulatory factor and Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP), as well as DNA synthesis proteins including dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase,</b> DNA polymerase and many others. While no other human tumor virus possesses these same genes, other tumor viruses target the same cellular pathways illustrating that at a basic level, all tumor viruses appear to attack the same cellular control pathways, so-called tumor suppressor pathways.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} gene (TMP 1) for yeast <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> (thymidylate synthase; EC 2. 1. 1. 45) was isolated from a chimeric plasmid bank by genetic complementation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Retransformation of the dTMP auxotroph GY 712 and a temperature-sensitive mutant (cdc 21) with purified plasmid (pTL 1) yielded Tmp+ transformants at high frequency. In addition, the plasmid was {{tested for the}} ability to complement a bacterial thyA mutant that lacks functional <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase.</b> Although {{it was not possible to}} select Thy+ transformants directly, it was found that all pTL 1 transformants were phenotypically Thy+ after several generations of growth in nonselective conditions.

No dUMP (< 1 fmol/Î¼mol of DNA) could be detected by these methods in DNA from cells not treated with methotrexate, regardless of whether Ura was present or absent. The presence of dUMP in DNA from cells treated with methotrexate {{is a result of the}} great increase in intracellular concentration of dUTP and the fall in dTTP that accompany inhibition of <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> (5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyltransferase; EC 2. 1. 1. 45) by the drug. These changes are apparently sufficient to overcome the normal mechanisms that exclude dUMP from DNA, and the enhancement by Ura reflects suppression of one of the mechanisms, Ura removal from DNA by the enzyme Ura-DNA glycosylase. The results suggest an active lesion of DNA in cells in which <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> is inhibited. Under these conditions there appears to be a cyclic incorporation and removal of dUMP resulting from reinsertion of dUMP during gap repair at sites of Ura removal. This consequence of the normal excision-repair process, which occurs when intracellular levels of dUTP approach those of dTTP, may have effects related to the cytotoxicity of drug inhibitors of <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase,</b> clinical deficiencies of folate and vitamin B- 12, and thymineless death, in general...|$|E
40|$|Clones of Plasmodium falciparum {{prepared}} {{from recent}} isolates of infected blood were studied {{to determine the}} molecular mechanism of naturally occurring pyrimethamine resistance. Total DNA, as well as <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> and dihydrofolate reductase activities, were characterized from these lines. Restriction analysis of DNA from pyrimethamine-susceptible and -resistant lines of the parasite showed no obvious amplification of any DNA fragment. Further, analysis of DNA from resistant and susceptible lines by centrifugation in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide revealed no extrachromosomal amplification in the resistant line. Comparison of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme activity in the two lines revealed similar KmS for substrate but a large difference in the inhibition constant for pyrimethamine. Additionally, the enzyme from the resistant line was considerably more stable in vitro than the corresponding enzyme from the susceptible line. The <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> activity in the two lines was similar and unaffected by pyrimethamine. The mechanism of drug resistance in this isolate involves altered properties of the dihydrofolate reductase conferring both a different affinity for the drug and increased stability...|$|E
40|$|Four {{overlapping}} cosmid clones {{were constructed}} that contain the complete genome of the attenuated Oka strain of VZV. Transfection of {{human melanoma cells}} with the four cosmids resulted in production of infectious VZV. A double-stranded oligonucleotide, encoding a stop codon in all three open reading frames, was inserted {{into one of the}} cosmids at the 5 ' end of the viral <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> gene. Transfection of melanoma cells with the mutant cosmid, along with the other three cosmids, resulted in VZV that does not express the viral <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> protein. The mutant virus grew at a rate {{similar to that of the}} parental Oka strain virus. Production of recombinant VZV using cosmid DNAs will be useful for studying the function of viral genes in VZV replication and establishment of latency. Furthermore, manipulation of the Oka strain of VZV might allow one to produce a vaccine virus that does not establish latency in the central nervous system or a virus that encodes foreign antigens for use as a polyvalent live virus vaccine...|$|E
40|$|The {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (fol) gene in Escherichia coli has been deleted and {{replaced}} by a selectable marker. Verification of the delta fol::kan strain has been accomplished using genetic and biochemical criteria, including Southern analysis of the chromosomal DNA. The delta fol::kan mutation is stable in E. coli K 549 [thyA polA 12 (Ts) ] and can be successfully transduced to other E. coli strains providing they have mutations in their <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> (thyA) genes. A preliminary investigation {{of the relationship between}} fol and thyA gene expression suggests that a Fol- cell (i. e., a dihydrofolate reductase deficiency phenotype) is not viable unless <b>thymidylate</b> <b>synthetase</b> activity is concurrently eliminated. This observation indicates that either the nonproductive accumulation of dihydrofolate or the depletion of tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools is lethal in a Fol- ThyA+ strain. Strains containing the thyA delta fol::kan lesions require the presence of Fol end products for growth, and these lesions typically increase the doubling time of the strain by a factor of 2. 5 in rich medium...|$|E
