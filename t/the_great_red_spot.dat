5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> a {{prominent}} oval-shaped {{feature in the}} southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> in 1831.|$|E
5|$|Planetary atmospheres are {{affected}} by the varying insolation or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot),</b> and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> but twice as large.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot.</b> A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the equilibrium states of a two-dimensional inviscid fluid in disk and annular geometries using the mean field equations that respect all conservation {{laws of the}} Euler equations. Axisymmetric vorticity distributions and their bifurcations to asymmetric solutions are calculated {{for a wide range}} of system parameters. Approximate zero-temperature compact vortices are also constructed and compared to symmetric states. From these results, the parameter ranges leading to the formation of a coherent vortex by the long time evolution from given initial conditions can be predicted without knowledge of the intervening dynamics. Applications to models of Jupiter’s <b>great</b> <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> and experiments on one-component plasmas in a magnetic field are discussed...|$|R

5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{atmospheric}} feature {{formed in}} the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter (5.2AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 {{times the}} mass {{of all the other}} planets put together. It is {{composed}} largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot.</b> Jupiter has 69 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Outer Planet Grand Tour Project, NASA and JPL examined less ambitious, alternative missions for exploring the outer planets. The mission that proved most attractive scientifically and fits within the projected NASA budget constraints embraces dual flights to Jupiter and Saturn, with launch in 1977. NASA has implemented it as the Mariner Jupiter/Saturn 1977 (MJS 77) Project. The MJS 77 mission covers exploratory investigations of the Jupiter and Saturn planetary systems and the interplanetary medium out to Saturn. Items of special interest include Jupiter's <b>great</b> <b>red</b> <b>spot,</b> <b>the</b> question of Io's anomalous brightening and phenomena associated with its EM behavior. After Saturn encounter, the spacecraft will escape the solar system {{in the general direction}} of the solar apex...|$|R

5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant to show any surface details.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{our understanding of}} the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> as a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E

5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> was {{revealed}} {{as a complex}} storm moving in a counterclockwise direction. An array of other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds.|$|E

25|$|Jupiter {{is covered}} with a cloud layer about 50km deep. The clouds are {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. The best-known feature of the cloud layer is <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator that is larger than Earth. In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> but smaller in size. The feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 2004, <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> had {{approximately}} half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres. At the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change {{is a result of}} normal fluctuations.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> {{may have}} existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied {{only after a}} {{prominent}} apparition in 1879. A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.|$|E
25|$|On February 25, 1979, {{when the}} Voyager 1 {{spacecraft}} was 9.2 million kilometres (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> back to Earth. Cloud details {{as small as}} 160 kilometres (100 miles) across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.|$|E
25|$|A minor mystery {{concerns}} a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by Donato Creti, which is {{exhibited in the}} Vatican. Part {{of a series of}} panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, and all overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy, Creti's painting is the first known to depict <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> as red. No Jovian feature was explicitly described as red before the late 1800s.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{structure}} of the equilibrium states of a regularized Keller-Segel model describing the chemotaxis of bacterial populations. We consider the limit of high degradation of the secreted chemical where analytical results can be obtained. Below a critical effective temperature, the system experiences a second order phase transition from a homogeneous phase to an inhomogeneous phase formed by two domains with uniform concentration separated by a thin interface (domain wall). We study the properties of the interface and determine the bifurcation between a circular shape (spot) and a rectangular shape (stripe) {{as a function of the}} control parameters. We show the analogy with {{the structure of}} Jupiter's <b>great</b> <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> which also consists in two phases with uniform potential vorticity separated by a thin annular jet.
