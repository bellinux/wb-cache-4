5|$|The Wireless <b>Telegraphy</b> Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless <b>telegraphy</b> apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless <b>telegraphy,</b> including the establishment or use of a wireless <b>telegraphy</b> station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The Wireless <b>Telegraphy</b> Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E
5|$|Guglielmo Marconi, the {{inventor}} of wireless <b>telegraphy,</b> successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel {{in the spring of}} 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to Brean Down (just south west of Weston, {{on the other side of}} the River Axe).|$|E
5|$|In March 1914, Regina Elena was {{involved}} in experiments with wireless <b>telegraphy</b> in Syracuse, Sicily. The tests were conducted by Guglielmo Marconi and were supervised by the Duke of the Abruzzi.|$|E
5|$|With the German {{declaration}} of war in August 1914, all further training at the naval academy was terminated and the normal compulsory officer examination was skipped. The entire Crew 1913 was assigned to various units in the Imperial Navy. Lindemann was assigned to , a battleship which belonged to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet {{under the command of}} Vizeadmiral (vice admiral) Reinhard Scheer, taking on the position of 3rd wireless <b>telegraphy</b> officer. Lothringen was mostly tasked with patrolling the North Sea, sailing back and forth between Altenbruch (now part of Cuxhaven) and Brunsbüttel without engaging in combat. Lindemann left Lothringen on 1 June 1915 to attend the wireless <b>telegraphy</b> school at Mürwik. He successfully completed the course and returned from it in July 1915. He then took over the position of 2nd wireless <b>telegraphy</b> officer and was promoted to Leutnant zur See (Second Lieutenant) on 18 September 1915.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, {{built the}} first fixed visual <b>telegraphy</b> system (or {{semaphore}} line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 Marine Broadcasting Offences Act officially outlawed {{offshore}} stations, but unlicensed radio continued, {{moving from}} ships and sea-based platforms to urban {{areas in the}} latter part of the 1960s (they were already illegal under the Wireless <b>Telegraphy</b> Act 1949). During this period, home-made medium wave (and sometimes short wave) transmitters were often constructed inside cheap, expendable biscuit tins.|$|E
5|$|As well as railway engineering, Brassey {{was active}} in the {{development}} of steamships, mines, locomotive factories, marine <b>telegraphy,</b> and water supply and sewage systems. He built part of the London sewerage system, still in operation today, and was a major shareholder in Brunel's The Great Eastern, the only ship large enough at the time to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable across the North Atlantic, in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Hector was {{assigned}} as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer {{during this period}} when the Queen and her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there until 1900 when she briefly {{became part of the}} HMS Vernon torpedo school as a store hulk. Hector became the first British warship to have wireless <b>telegraphy</b> installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|In September 1909, Liberté, Justice, and Vérité {{visited the}} United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. In early 1911, Justice and Vérité were used with {{success in the}} Navy's {{experiments}} with wireless <b>telegraphy.</b> Later that year, in September, Liberté was destroyed by a huge explosion in her forward propellant magazines. Several nearby warships were damaged by debris, including the battleship République. The explosion aboard Liberté killed some 250 officers and men. The wreck was left in Toulon until 1925, when it was raised and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to <b>telegraphy,</b> these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|Stone's {{first wife}} Maria died in Washington, D.C., shortly after Stone's release from Fort Hamilton. While serving in New Orleans during 1863, Stone {{fell in love}} with Jeanne Stone and they had two daughters and a son, John Stone Stone, who later became a pioneer in the field of {{wireless}} <b>telegraphy.</b> Stone was also an original founding member of the Aztec Club of 1847, a social organization for officers who served in the Mexican–American War.|$|E
5|$|The infant Army Signal Corps, {{which had}} played a {{valuable}} part in the Civil War, had {{a need for a}} post-war training ground. In 1866, the Army allowed the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, General Albert J. Myer, to use Fort Greble for this purpose. Then, in 1868, Myer requested and received control over Fort Greble as a signal communications school for instruction in electric <b>telegraphy</b> and visual signaling. In January 1869, however, Myer moved the school from Fort Greble and soon established it at Fort Whipple, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In January 1919, Collingwood was {{transferred}} to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon {{the dissolution of the}} Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was redesignated the Third Fleet and Collingwood became its flagship. She became a tender to HMS Vivid on 1 October and served as a gunnery and wireless <b>telegraphy</b> (W/T) training ship. The W/T school {{was transferred}} to Glorious on 1 June 1920 and the gunnery duties followed in early August; Collingwood returned to the reserve. She became a boys' training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was paid off on 31 March 1922. Collingwood was sold to John Cashmore Ltd for scrap on 12 December and arrived at Newport, Wales, on 3 March 1923 to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|Néstor Carlos Kirchner {{was born}} on 25 February 1950, in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, a federal {{territory}} at the time. His father, Néstor Carlos Kirchner Sr., met the Chilean María Juana Ostoić by <b>telegraphy.</b> They had three children: Néstor, Alicia, and María Cristina. Néstor {{was part of the}} third generation of Kirchners living in the city. As a result of pertussis, he developed strabismus at an early age; however, he refused medical treatment because he considered his eye part of his self-image. When Kirchner was in high school he briefly considered becoming a teacher, but poor diction hampered him; he was also unsuccessful at basketball.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} <b>telegraphy.</b> His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, München was {{employed}} as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with wireless <b>telegraphy.</b> After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} High Seas Fleet. She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914. That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland Bight. During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders. At 12:25, the two cruisers were ordered to move into the Bight and support the cruiser , but at 14:06, München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north-east of Heligoland.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hector {{was laid}} down on 8 March 1861 by Robert Napier and Sons in Govan. She was {{launched}} on 26 September 1861, completed in January 1862, and commissioned on 22 February 1864. She cost £294,000 to build, including a payment of £35,000 to her builders who had underestimated their costs. She {{served with the}} Channel Fleet until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886; during this time her only military activity occurred when she was detailed to service in the Particular Service Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Hornsby during the Russian war scare of June to August, 1878. Hector was assigned as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer during this period when the Queen, and her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there, partly dismantled, until 1900 when she briefly became part of the torpedo school HMS Vernon as a store hulk. Hector became the first British warship to have wireless <b>telegraphy</b> installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy. The ship was sold for scrap in 1905.|$|E
5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless <b>telegraphy</b> interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{reassembled}} on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, {{where it}} conducted a mock {{attack on the}} harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with wireless <b>telegraphy</b> {{on a large scale}} and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major landing operation, after which the ships took the ground troops from the IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.|$|E

5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless <b>telegraphy</b> (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E
5|$|Wettin and the I Squadron {{participated in}} an {{exercise}} in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March, and a major fleet exercise {{took place in the}} North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea {{with the rest of the}} fleet.

25|$|The {{period between}} 1945 and 1970 was {{dominated}} by a strategic disagreement between NRK and the <b>Telegraphy</b> Administration.

After the war there was initially consensus to reverse the decision, but NRK and Minister Kaare Fostervoll decided to support the new arrangement. A government committee agreed with Fostervoll, as did Parliament, and the transition was completed in 1950. NRK captured many of the <b>Telegraphy</b> Administration's younger engineers, which reinforced the tendencies for an innovative NRK and a conservative <b>Telegraphy</b> Administration.|$|E
25|$|Theodore {{was born}} on July 16, 1845 in Malvern, Ohio, and he was educated in Morristown, New Jersey. At first he studied {{medicine}} with his uncle.

25|$|<b>Telegraphy</b> {{requires}} that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according {{to the limits of}} the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of electricity led to the invention of electrical <b>telegraphy.</b> The advent of radio in the early 20th century brought about radiotelegraphy and other forms of wireless <b>telegraphy.</b> In the Internet age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication and ease of use, with natural language interfaces that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as electronic mail and instant messaging.|$|E

Parliament approved trial broadcasting in 1953 for two year, despite protests from the <b>Telegraphy</b> Administration. Starting on 12 January 1954, these were only sent from a transmitter in Oslo and were not announced. They were terminated in 1956.|$|E
