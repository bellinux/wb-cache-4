The ham and cheese {{sandwich}} was a regional offering, however it was reintroduced nationally in the United States as the Yumbo Sandwich in November 2014. The Yumbo name refers to a smaller snack based sandwich from the 1970s and early 1980s which was a heated ham and cheese sandwich served on a smaller, hamburger roll. The Long Fish was discontinued and the Whaler fish sandwich was reintroduced in 1983, while <b>the</b> <b>Steak</b> Burger sandwich was discontinued altogether.|$|E
5|$|A grilled Italian sausage {{sandwich}} {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions and peppers or parmigiana style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets promotion in 1993, the chain introduced a grilled meatloaf sandwich with ketchup and onions in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst sandwich in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The sandwich featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> sandwich have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak sandwich, and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak Sandwich which was almost identical to the 1979 sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} and earned the win against the St. Louis Blues. The win marked the {{beginning}} of a six-game winning streak with Schneider as the starting goaltender each game. He allowed a total of six goals during <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> and posted two shutouts. The wins put the Canucks back into first in the Northwest. In the second game of their winning streak, defenceman Alexander Edler collided with Phoenix Coyotes' goaltender Mike Smith and was given a five-minute major for charging. The following day, Edler was given a two-game suspension for his actions. Also during the Canucks' winning streak, they began to have injury problems. Booth suffered a leg injury that required surgery which ended his season. In 12 games played, Booth scored only a single goal into an empty net. Winger Dale Weise injured a shoulder. Kassian suffered a back injury, and Steve Pinizzotto missed games due to an illness. With the forward corps depleted, defenceman Keith Ballard was moved to forward. He continued to play upfront until he suffered a broken foot.|$|E

25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first meat grinder {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> gradually became distant from its German roots {{in the minds of many}} Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including hot dogs and meatloaf.|$|E

500|$|Steak {{has become}} a popular dish in many places around the world, cooked in {{domestic}} as well as professional kitchens, and is often a primary ingredient in a menu. It is used in small amounts in an hors d'oeuvre, in an entrée dish or more usually, in a larger amount as the main course. A steak knife is a specialized piece of cutlery to make cutting <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> easier. It is sharper than other knives and has a serrated edge. Steak has also been an important breakfast dish, especially for people undertaking hard outdoor work, such as farmers. [...] Diners ordering steak at a restaurant typically advise the chef or waiter of their preferences regarding the degree of cooking, using the terms [...] "rare", [...] "medium-rare", [...] "medium", [...] "medium-well", or [...] "well-done". [...] Print appearances of this use of [...] "rare" [...] are found as early as c. 1615.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{vegetables}} {{that come with}} the hamburger, the first described in the literature on its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings. Thus, the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of plant product, whether that be lettuce (as {{in the case of the}} BLT sandwich), sauerkraut (as on the reuben), coleslaw, or pickles. It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> with the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more [...] "natural" [...] appearance and taste. All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s. In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of Tex-Mex style burgers, which are served with a side of chili con carne.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 19th century, most of the {{northern}} European emigrants who traveled to the New World embarked on their transatlantic voyages from Hamburg. The German shipping company Hamburg America Line, also known as the Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien-Gesellschaft (HAPAG), was involved in Atlantic transport for almost a century. The company began operations in 1847 and employed many German immigrants, many of them fleeing the revolutions of 1848–9. The vast majority of settlers and emigrants from various parts of northern Europe also began their voyages to the United States from Hamburg, introducing their culinary customs to their host country. New York City was the most common destination for ships traveling from Hamburg, and various restaurants in the city began offering the Hamburg-style steak in order to attract German sailors. <b>The</b> <b>steak</b> frequently appeared on the menu as a Hamburg-style American fillet, or even beefsteak à Hambourgeoise. [...] Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants, evoking memories of the port of Hamburg and the world they left behind.|$|E

2500|$|A cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll {{filled with}} thinly sliced sautéed ribeye beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese {{of choice is}} Cheez Whiz, but American and {{provolone}} are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies {{in the balance of}} flavors, textures and what {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "drip" [...] factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, Pat's King of Steaks on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to <b>the</b> <b>steak.</b> The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1931, New York Times {{reporter}} William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in {{the interests}} of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it.

It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. <b>The</b> <b>steak</b> was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible.

2500|$|The Sublime Society of Beef Steaks was {{established}} in 1735 by John Rich at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, {{of which he was}} then manager. One version of its origin has it that the Earl of Peterborough, supping one night with Rich in his private room, was so delighted with <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> Rich grilled him that he suggested a repetition of the meal the next week. Another version is that George Lambert, the scene-painter at the theatre, was often too busy to leave the theatre and [...] "contented himself with a beefsteak broiled upon the fire in the painting-room." [...] His visitors so enjoyed sharing this dish that they set up the Sublime Society. [...] William and Robert Chambers, writing in 1869, favour the second version, noting that Peterborough was not one of the original members. A third version, favoured by [...] the historian of the society, Walter Arnold, is that the society was formed out of the regular dinners shared at the theatre by Rich and Lambert, consisting of hot steak dressed by Rich, accompanied by [...] "a bottle of old port from the tavern hard by." [...] Whatever the details of its genesis, Rich and Lambert are listed as the first two of the society's twenty-four founding members. Women were not admitted. [...] From the outset, the society strove to avoid the term [...] "club", but the shorter [...] "Beefsteak Club" [...] was soon used by many as an informal alternative.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of aging on the tenderness and palatability of beef from the semitendinosus muscle of the round. Tenderness may be affected by the length of the aging period and <b>the</b> aging temperature. <b>Steaks</b> from <b>the</b> semitendinosus muscle were stored for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hr at two temperatures, 43. 3 °C and 2. 2 °C. Ultra high temperature (UHT) pasteurization was accomplished by subjecting the meat to 1100 °C for 20 seconds. UHT pasteurization denatures surface proteins, destroys vegetative pathogens, and eliminates some spoilage organisms from the surface of the meat. UHT -treated steaks were cooked in a microwave oven to an internal temperature of 71. 1 °C. Two cores were taken from the center of each cooked steak. Shear values (lb) were determined on the cores using a Warner Bratzler shear. The results of the study showed that <b>the</b> UHT-treated <b>steaks</b> that were stored at 43. 3 °C were significantly more tender than those that were refrigerated at 2. 2 °C regardless of the length of the aging period up to 24 hr. Additional tenderness at 2. 2 °C when the aging period exceeds 24 hr may be possible. Total plate count (TPC) of raw and UHT-treated steaks was determined using the standard plate count method. The average TPC for <b>the</b> raw <b>steaks</b> was significantly higher than <b>the</b> UHT-treated <b>steaks.</b> <b>The</b> TPC was not significantly different between <b>the</b> UHT- treated <b>steaks</b> that were aged and those that were not aged. A trained panel was used for sensory evaluation to evaluate the moistness, tenderness, and flavor of <b>the</b> <b>steaks</b> using a 9 -point hedonic scale. Sensory scores of <b>the</b> UHT-treated <b>steaks</b> revealed that steaks stored at 43. 3 °C had significantly more moisture and were more tender than those stored at 2. 2 °C. The panel noted more spoiled flavor among <b>the</b> <b>steaks</b> stored at 43. 3 °C than 2. 2 °C. Steaks stored at 2. 2 °C received significantly higher flavor scores than those stored at 43. 3 °C...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the penetration behaviour of different brines with tumbled beef <b>steaks</b> from <b>the</b> biceps femoris muscle, specifically their interactions with pH and effects on yield. Six muscles from different animals, divided into origin (OP) and insertion (IP) portions, were cut into 60 steaks of 2. 5 cm thickness and tumbled for 30 or 60 min. <b>The</b> <b>steaks</b> were tumbled with two brines, with (WTB/HSP) or without (WTB) hydrolysed soy protein (HSP), and steaks that were not tumbled with brine or water were used as controls. Brine penetration was verified by measuring the amount of dye-containing brine (absorbance at 627 nm) recovered from homogenates of four thin (2 mm) slices {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> beef <b>steaks</b> after tumbling. <b>The</b> WTB/HSP <b>steaks</b> exhibited greater (P < 0. 05) brine penetration when tumbled for 60 min than for 30 min. <b>The</b> OP <b>steaks</b> showed greater yield and lower pH (P < 0. 05) than IP steaks. HSP-added brine increased the water absorption and retention in the first slices of <b>the</b> <b>steaks,</b> and its efficiency was increased with a longer tumbling time. The portion of the biceps femoris muscle used influenced brine absorption and retention, impacting meat yield. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
