40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaDuring space flight, the {{communications}} and tracking {{system of the}} Space Shuttle orbiter uses S- and Ku-band links to provide tracking; reception of digitized voice, commands, and printed or diagramatic data at a maximum rate of 216 kilobits a second; and transmission of digitized voice, telemetry, television, and data at a maximum rate of 50 megabits a second. S-band links may be established directly with a ground station and both S- and Ku-band links may be routed through NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System A simultaneous capability to communicate with other satellites or spacecraft, {{using a variety of}} formats and modulation techniques on more than 850 S-band channels, is provided. UHF is used for communication with extravehicular astronauts. Audio and <b>television</b> <b>subsystems</b> serve on-board needs as well as interfacing with the RF equipment. During aerodynamic flight following entry, a UHF link provides two-way simplex voice communication with Air Traffic Control facilities.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaDuring {{the first}} flight of Columbia (STS- 1), the Instrumentation, Communications, and Tracking Subsystems (I-C&TSS) of the Space Shuttle orbiter used S-band links to provide (in {{addition}} to tracking) reception of digitized voice, commands, and printed or diagrammatic data at a maximum rate of 72 kilobits per second (kbps). The subsystem also provided a transmission capability for digitized voice, telemetry, television, and real-time and recorded data. Communication was via S-band directly to the ground stations; ultrahigh frequency (UHF) voice was used for communication with the landing site and some ground stations and for providing a backup link for state vector update. Audio and <b>television</b> <b>subsystems</b> served on-board needs and interfaced with the radio frequency (RF) equipment. Provisions were provided to record on-board data for post-flight playback. During aerodynamic flight following entry, the S-band link was used to supplement the UHF link that provides two-way simplex voice communication with air traffic control facilities. The I-C&T subsystem for STS- 1 operated with almost textbook performance; exceptions were a dedicated signal conditioner redundancy failure, failure of the development flight instrumentation PCM recorder, and some measurement sensor failures...|$|E

40|$|A vehicle {{system has}} been built and tested to {{investigate}} some of the unknown factors {{with regard to the}} operation of a remotely controlled vehicle {{on the surface of the}} moon. A general vehicle system description is presented, giving attention to the wheel drive subsystem, the steering subsystem, the power system, the control console, the command <b>subsystem,</b> the <b>television</b> <b>subsystem,</b> the telemetry subsystem, and the navigation subsystem. The remote control driving station consists of the antenna system, the video display system, the instrument and control panel, the data panel, and the steering and throttle controls. Initial tests with the vehicle and the remote driving station were conducted in March and April 1971...|$|R

An elaborate picture-taking sequence resulted in transmission of over 4000 frames back to earth during two flyby encounters with Mercury. These sequences utilized a real-time data rate of 117. 6 kbit/s, resulting in coverage of about 75 % of the lighted portion of Mercury's surface at a resolution of better than 2 km. The complete set of useful images, which amounted to about 3000 frames, was processed with three different types of digital image-processing enhancements...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to create Internet Protocol Television Management Information System that allows not only to inform the user about the progress of television work, but also to manage <b>television</b> system and <b>subsystems.</b> This system was created by an order of Kaunas University of Technology television which broadcast its program over IP networks. IP TV control and information system helps to achieve the goals set by the television: •	easily and conveniently using only a web interface to inform users about news on television channel {{and allow them to}} comment on news releases; •	using only a Web interface to collect information about the video materials and using this archive make TV playlist; •	using only a Web interface to carry out the live TV streams; •	using the system to carry out projects; •	collect television viewing statistics. System services are fragmented to three types of users: ordinary user can read the information; operators and reporters can enter the news information, edit them, enter and edit data about the video materials. Program Director can modify the program categories, he can create them and delete old ones, create a playlist, management live television broadcasts. The administrator can edit all forms of data: remove incorrect information, change the user types...|$|R
