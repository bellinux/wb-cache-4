5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much {{of the human}} {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, {{in a series of}} mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Together, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.|$|E

25|$|The Norman Hauteville family, {{who were}} {{descendants}} of Vikings, came to appreciate and admire {{the rich and}} layered culture in which they now found themselves. And they began implementing their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily also adopted some of the attributes of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, {{and even in the}} presence of palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem. The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued {{in the language of the}} community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence. The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the most extraordinary buildings <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> ever seen.|$|E

500|$|A {{month after}} the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines' chief {{executive}} Ahmad Jauhari Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined but failed to provide specific details. This may have partially resulted from the suspension of the airline's advertising campaigns following the disappearance.

It is important that we provide answers for them. It is important <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> answers, as well." [...] In further remarks, Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370's disappearance. In China, where the majority of passengers were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60 percent in March.|$|E

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E

Cohen wrote that Smith's thesis, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> entered {{a new era of}} conflict, is of [...] "central importance" [...] for the United States military, which Cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if Smith was correct. Cohen criticised the book for its limited historical perspective, noting that conventional wars are still fought (for example the Kargil War in 1999) and that several confrontations in Asia threatened to spill over into conventional warfare. Nevertheless, Cohen concluded [...] "Smith has clearly written {{one of the most important}} books on modern warfare in the last decade. We would be better off if the United States had a few more generals like him".|$|E

500|$|After several further {{meetings}} and {{an exchange of}} letters, Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant. Now living in relative poverty, Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money, instead paying him in magical instruction. In March 1945, Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood, a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living. He continued living there with Crowley for several months, dealing with the old man's correspondences and needs. In turn, {{he was allowed to}} read from Crowley's extensive library on occult subjects, and performed ceremonial magic workings with him, becoming a high initiate of Crowley's magical group, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK, writing in his diary, [...] "value of Grant.

[...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> ever seen.

500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>has</b> now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
