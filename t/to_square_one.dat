25|$|It may be {{difficult}} to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does {{not have to worry about}} simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one,</b> and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.|$|E
500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one</b> to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
500|$|After the bad {{commercial}} results of Running Wild, Mercury broke {{the contract with}} Girlschool, leaving the band without financial backup and with a career in dire straits. [...] "Back <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one</b> again", McAuliffe said at the time. The band {{decided to go back}} to their roots, remaining a quartet with only McAuliffe on vocals and going on a UK tour in November – December 1985 supporting Blue Öyster Cult; their immediate goal was to play as much as they could and regain some of their fan base. In early 1986, thanks again to Lemmy’s suggestion, they eventually signed for Doug Smith’s new label GWR Records, which also included in their roster Motörhead. The girls immediately started working on a new album with their old producer Vic Maile at Jackson’s Studio in Rickmansworth. The first output of their new work was a team-up with British glam rock singer Gary Glitter for the cover of his 1973 hit [...] "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)", which was released as a single in April 1986. The album Nightmare at Maple Cross, released in July of the same year, marked for the band the return to the sound of Hit and Run and to their trademark abrasive lyrics. The album received fairly good reviews, but it did not enter the British charts and was released in North America only a year later. The following European tour saw the girls supporting the Scottish hard rock band Nazareth.|$|E

2500|$|... 25: The Aki basho is won by Hakuho, who avoids a {{possible}} three way playoff between himself, Kotoshogiku and Kisenosato by beating Harumafuji to finish one win {{ahead of the}} sekiwake pair on 13–2 (Harumafuji's bid for yokozuna promotion ends with a mediocre 8–7 record). Kotoshogiku is assured of ozeki promotion and gets prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. Kisenosato shares the Outstanding Performance prize, and gets his first ever jun-yusho or runner-up performance. He {{will be looking for}} ozeki promotion himself in November. Kakuryu, by contrast, is back <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one</b> after scoring only 9–6. The Fighting Spirit prize goes to Gagamaru for his fine 11–4 record which included a win over ozeki Baruto. Myogiryu wins his second jūryō championship in a row, this time without the need for a playoff.|$|E

2500|$|Farmer and {{his wife}} Marlene sold their house in 1992 and ran a two-star Southway Auto Lodge motel in South Perth until 1998,. Farmer said the {{business}} failed due to the downturn in the Asian economy and a 40% drop in tourist numbers, and left him with no money or assets. He said, [...] "We have nothing {{and we are back}} <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one.</b> But we didn’t borrow money to keep the business going. All my life I have helped myself {{and there is no reason}} why I can’t still do that". Farmer and Marlene were given temporary accommodation in the caretaker’s flat in the Main Roads building. Two fundraising events were organised in Perth and Melbourne by John Watts, Bob Davis and Sam Newman, raising $120,000. A trust fund was established with the money and a small villa bought in Innaloo.|$|E
2500|$|The third season, {{consisting}} of 16 episodes, shows Michael {{in his quest}} to have his burn notice lifted. [...] The season begins where the previous left off: Michael swims back to Miami, where he is met by Michelle Paxson (Moon Bloodgood), a Miami police detective who is intent on bringing Michael down. [...] After he finally convinces her to stay away, Michael is approached by Tom Strickler (Ben Shenkman), an agent to the spies. [...] Strickler claims that he can have Michael's burn notice lifted, but {{at a very high}} cost. [...] Michael eventually must kill Strickler instead to save Fiona's life. [...] In the meantime, Michael begins meeting Diego Garza (Otto Sanchez), a CIA agent who gives Michael information about his burn notice. [...] However, after Strickler's death, Garza is murdered, and Michael is nearly back <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one.</b> [...] Later, Michael is confronted by Mason Gilroy (Chris Vance), a freelance psychopath who once worked for Strickler and confesses to the murder of Garza. [...] Gilroy asks for Michael's help with an operation, and Michael, not wanting to let Gilroy get away with anything, follows. [...] He discovers that Gilroy is attempting to break a high-risk felon out of prison. [...] After Gilroy's murder, Michael learns the identity of the prisoner: Simon Escher (Garret Dillahunt), the man who committed the crimes for which Michael was framed. [...] In the final scenes of the season, Michael is arrested and taken to a mysterious room.|$|E
2500|$|Baruto's {{promotion}} {{was officially}} {{confirmed by the}} Sumo Association on March 31. Speaking to reporters at his Onoe stable, he said, [...] "I want to be cheerful and be an ōzeki that can {{live up to the}} expectations of the fans." [...] He also made clear his determination to win the yūshō, as [...] "unless I win a championship I can't move up to yokozuna." [...] However, for a significant period {{he was not able to}} challenge for the championship as an ōzeki, his best score never being higher than 11–4. This changed in January 2012, when after he recorded 13 straight wins and his nearest challenger yokozuna Hakuhō suffered three losses in four bouts, he took the championship with two days left to spare. [...] This made him the ninth foreigner, and the second from Europe after Kotoōshū, to win a top division championship. [...] He finished on 14–1, denied a perfect record by Hakuhō on the final day. He was told he had to win the next tournament or be in contention until the final day to earn a shot at yokozuna promotion, but Baruto told reporters the day after celebrating his victory, [...] "If I can wrestle at the spring basho like I did at the New Year meet, results will follow. Once you win one tournament, you want to win a second, a third, a 10th and a 30th." [...] At the Osaka tournament in March he stood at 9–1 after ten days, but lost four of his last five matches to finish on a disappointing 10–5, putting any hopes for yokozuna promotion back <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>one.</b> Baruto had been suffering from a fever during the tournament and said afterwards that talk of yokozuna was just [...] "journalistic chatter... that wasn't my goal in this tournament." ...|$|E
