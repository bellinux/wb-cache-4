5|$|From {{the first}} attack at 12:37 to the {{explosion}} at 14:23, Yamato {{was hit by}} at least 11 torpedoes and six bombs. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> two more torpedo and bomb hits, {{but this is not}} confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the leper colony on Brei Holm <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony.|$|E

5|$|In fast-progressing cases, {{mortality}} {{was primarily}} from pneumonia, by virus-induced pulmonary consolidation. Slower-progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> neural involvement {{that led to}} mental disorders in some cases. Some deaths resulted from malnourishment.|$|E
5|$|While <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognisable and obviously different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, {{but is also}} very popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E
5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita {{is typical}} of India – the {{idealized}} India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature {{of the past and}} world literature of the future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E

5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E
5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population is lacking. It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, {{although there was no}} evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E

5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books {{that were in the}} cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins. According {{to the findings of}} later resistivity and gradiometer surveys there may also have been a formal Tudor garden and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> fish ponds.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Roman settlement on the site. In the early 13th century, Lord Greenhalgh and his family lived at Highfield House (under what is now the M60 motorway).|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The famous {{eruption}} in AD 79 was {{preceded by}} numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.|$|E

5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|The Burgess Shale {{animals were}} {{probably}} killed {{by changes in}} their environment either immediately preceding or during the mud-slides that buried them. Proposed killing mechanisms include: changes in salinity; poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane; changes in the availability of oxygen; and changing consistency of the sea floor. The death event was not necessarily related to the burial, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> multiple death events between burial events; but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand any chance of being fossilised, instead of rotting or being eaten.|$|E
5|$|The city of Chester was an {{important}} Roman stronghold. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Christian basilica {{on the site of}} the present cathedral in the late Roman era, while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to Saint Paul and Saint Peter. This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from SaintPeter to SaintWerburgh.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> also <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> some spiritual {{connotation}} {{similar to}} the chancel screen in churches. They were often wooden screens decorated with carvings or interlocking turned pieces of wood (similar to a mashrabiya).|$|R
50|$|There is no {{consensus}} about when {{the foundation of the}} town occurred, other than <b>there</b> <b>may</b> always <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a small settlement of fishermen, weavers and some sort of agricultural trade post.|$|R
