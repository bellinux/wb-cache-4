40|$|The impact ball {{has shown}} to give {{excitations}} in close resemblance with the excitation {{from a human}} step. However due to practice and practical measurement reasons, {{it is interesting to}} use the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> in low-frequency measurements. Here, the two excitation techniques; the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and the impact ball, are compared in terms of statistical dispersion. In the AkuLite project light weight apartment buildings were measured using a <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and a (Japanese) impact ball in the low frequency range down to 20 Hz. The results showed that the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> gives more narrow/better confidence interval in the test compared to the test using one excitation point together with the impact ball. The t-test of the consistency of the difference between the impact ball and <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> for the same measurement objects shows weak correlation, which implies that the results from the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> are not normally possible to be interchanged with impact ball results and vice versa, without using a correction factor.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} on the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> {{has shown that the}} impact on a floor depends strongly on the combined system of floor and tapping hammers. This means that in general, a particular measure to reduce the impact sound pressure level can be advantageous with one impact source and disadvantageouswith another. Conversion from one impact source to another has to be made for each floor individually, provided there is a sufficient knowledge of the dynamic properties of the source and floor. So, if the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is to be used to characterise a floor with respect to walking noise, the only simple way out of the problem is to make it 'behave like a walker'. That means it should have the same source impedance. Investigations at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik Stuttgart showed that this could be achieved by small modifications to the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Comparisons using a concrete floor and a wooden joist floor have proved that results using such a modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> are much closer to walking noise than the results using the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
40|$|Impact sound {{insulation}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects when assessing {{sound insulation}} of floor constructions in buildings. For assessing the impact sound insulation of aconstruction, a standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is used as a sound source. However, the use of the current standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> has been criticised, especially with regard to measurement of wooden joist floors since the noise spectrum generated by a <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> differs from the spectrum generated by actual footfall. There are insufficient low frequency components in the noise spectrum produced by the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and it does not, therefore, accurately reflect low frequency noise from the construction. Reduce impact sound level from wooden joist floors are the main object of our study. It is important to be able to predict the sound insulation properties of wooden joist constructions at the design stage. To reduce the noise level in the receiving room, the input power transmitted through the construction must be estimated where the appropriate sound- and vibration-insulation can be designed. This study has investigated the waveform and frequency spectra of human footfall (walking, rum- ingand jumping); of the dropping of sand balls, sand bags and tires; and of the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The impact sound power radiation from a wooden joist construction while applying different impact sources, such as actual footfall and the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> have also been studied. Research was also carried out regarding the development of a practical impact sound insulation calculation method for wooden joist floor constructions. The characteristics with regard to mechanical properties of floor construction was calculated using the impedance method. The impact sound level inside the sound receiving room was determined. The method developed can predict the basic performance of the wooden floor structure when excited by impact sounds. Godkänd; 1995; 20070108 (biem...|$|R

50|$|A <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a device}} {{used to test}} the impact sound {{insulation}} of floors. The standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> has five hammers placed in a line. Each hammer is lifted and dropped in turn, creating 20 impacts per second on the floor. In the room below, a sound level meter is used to measure the sound level created by the impacts. Because the force and frequency of the impacts is known, the impact insulation provided by the floor can be determined from the sound level.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{research}} has shown that low frequency impact sound is of significant importance for inhabitants´ perception of impact sound in buildings with light weight wooden joist floors. The <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is well defined as an excitation device and is a standard tool for building acoustics. However, the excitation force spectrum generated for each individual floor is unknown when using a <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> In order to increase the possibilities to compare simulations to impact sound measurements, {{there is a need for}} improvement of impact sound measurement methods. By measuring the input force spectrum by a modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and the sound in the receiver room, transfer functions can be achieved. In the light weight wooden building used for the evaluation test of the proposed method, structural nonlinearities are evident in the frequency response functions stemming from different excitation levels. This implies that for accurate FRF-measurements in low frequencies, excitation magnitudes that are similar to these stemming from human excitations should preferably be used. ProWoo...|$|R
40|$|For each of {{a series}} of {{full-scale}} floor-ceiling assemblies, standard impact measurements were made with the sources defined in ISO 10140 including the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> the modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> and the heavy/soft impact source (rubber ball), dropped from various heights. Additionally, sound recordings were made of the sounds generated by the ball drops and by adult walkers without shoes. The standard impact measurements were used to calculate standardized metrics and non-standardized variants. The recordings of the walkers' footfalls and of the "thumps" resulting from the ball drops were played back in a controlled laboratory room to listening test participants, who subjectively rated the reproduced sounds in terms of relative "annoyance". Preliminary results from 19 bare floors (i. e., no coverings) indicated: that listeners ranked the floor assemblies slightly differently for the walkers than for the ball drops; and that some objective metrics determined from measurements with the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and with the rubber impact ball correlated most highly with the subjective response to both types of impact sounds.

40|$|Multi-storey timber {{buildings}} up to 6 {{and more}} floors are increasingly built in many European countries. The challenge with these buildings {{can be that}} with traditional intermediate floor constructions in timber {{it can be difficult}} to fulfill the standard requirements and even when they are met, low frequency transmission can still cause complaints. Additionally it is difficult to develop appropriate light weight floor constructions since it is well known that the correlation between the standardized evaluation methods using the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and the human perception of impact noise can be poor, especially in buildings with light weight structures. In the AcuWood project, measurements and recordings on different intermediate timber floor constructions in the laboratory and the field were performed covering a wide range of modern intermediate timber floor constructions. Additionally, one intermediate concrete floor with different floor coverings was included in the study. Besides the standardized <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> the modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and the Japanese rubber ball and "real" sources were employed. Subjective ratings from listening tests were correlated to many technical single number descriptors including the standardized descriptors and non-standardized proposals. It was found that the Japanese rubber ball represents walking noise in its characteristics and spectrum best, taking into account the practical requirement of a strong enough excitation for building measurements. The standardized <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> leads also to an acceptably high determination coefficient between the descriptor and the subjective ratings. Additionally, the study delivered data, from which proposals for requirements for the suggested single number ratings are deduced, based on the subjective ratings...|$|R

In consequence the development and optimization of a new building component is a very tedious and expensive task. A considerable reduction of these costs could be achieved, if the optimization relying on measurements would be replaced-at least to some extent-by a computational prediction model. For these models it is necessary to represent not only the component and the adjacent rooms but also the excitation in a suitable way.

40|$|Drum {{sound is}} the sound {{produced}} when an object, such as a foot, hits the flooring in the room in which the receiving ear is located. Drum sound has attracted interest in recent years, particularly due to an increased use of thin floating floor constructions, such as veneer or laminate flooring, which can produce loud and sharp walking sound. A prediction model of the subjective response, in a paired comparison test, to drum sound based on differences in objective measurements is developed. The difference in 10 -percentile loudness, N 10, between two stimuli is shown to predict the subjective perceived disturbance better than, for example, A-weighted sound pressure level. A difference of about 8 % in N 10 resulted in 50 % of the assessors noticing a difference. A comparison of different existing approaches to analysing the result from a paired comparison test is made. The main focus is set on the basic models by Thurstone-Mosteller and Bradley-Terry and extensions of these concerning ties. Procedures for testing if the responses and calculated ranking values are statistically different are presented. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these methods are discussed. These methods are illustrated with examples from tests on drum sound from floor coverings. A branch norm has been established for measuring drum sound on laminate floor coverings. The norm evaluates the subjective perception of the drum sound's loudness using the ISO <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> A round-robin study of the norm is reported along with the results of a paired comparison listening test using the same floor coverings. General aspects of evaluation measures, <b>tapping</b> <b>machines,</b> test environments, etc., that need to be considered when measuring drum sound on various floor coverings are discussed. It is concluded that loudness as measured according to ISO 532 B correlates the best with the subjective perception of the drum sound's loudness. The <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> can be used to excite hard floor coverings to produce the drum sound, but should be used with caution in studying low-level drum sounds due to the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine's</b> inherent mechanical noise...|$|R
50|$|Impact {{insulation}} class (or IIC) is an integer-number rating {{of how well}} a building floor attenuates impact sounds, such as footsteps. A larger number means more attenuation.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have posed {{the question of}} whether the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> simulates the impedance of real sources well enough to properly judge the impact sound insulation performance of a floor. Proposed solutions such as the modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> the bang machine, and ball were results of these investigations. Recent data collected on bare (wood and concrete) floors, suggest that in the low frequency range, the impedance of the source has no influence on the power injected into the floor. This is presumably due to the fact that the bare floors have much higher impedances than most common sources, meaning only the blocked force of the source influences the injected power. This furthermore suggests that modifying or redeveloping the source is not necessary, and that through use of an appropriate weighting curve a single number rating that correlates well with subjective measurements can be defined. Supporting objective and subjective results are presented. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years the use of {{lightweight}} buildings made of prefabricated wooden elements has become more common. Ease of installation, high accuracy and lightness of such buildings has attracted builders and designers. Sweden, having a large coverage of renewable forests has an increasing interest in multi-storey wooden buildings. However noise and vibration in wooden buildings is an issue of concern especially low frequency impact sound due to footsteps. Impact sound insulation of floors can be measured based on ISO 140 - 7 using standardized <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> as excitation source. Experience has shown that in many cases the results obtained by this method do not correlate with annoyance experienced by inhabitants. On the other hand, the method presented in ISO 140 - 7 has usually shown to be relevant for the evaluation of impact sound transmission of concrete floors. Discovering the source of this contradiction requires deeper understanding of the impact process. A first step would be to find the difference between contact forces of the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> on different floor materials. One could then correlate it with inhabitants’ perceived annoyance. This paper is the first step of this investigation which is a part of a Swedish research project called AkuLite. In this work a time-dependent model based on Hertz’s contact law is presented for the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The model is validated by measurements on a homogeneous concrete floor. Also the contribution of parameters such as damping and stiffness of floor material on the resulting impact force and vibrations is studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{rating of}} impact sound {{insulation}} {{on the basis of}} <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> measurements with the ISO reference values has proved to be unsatisfactory in practice. This is mainly due to the differences in spectrum shape of <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> noise and real life impact noises, such as walking. The problem can be solved by changing the reference values in accordance with these differences in spectrum shape. The difference between tapping and walking noise spectra has been established by measurements on 49 different floors. In the most important frequency range (125 - 500 Hz) it was discovered to be sufficiently constant for all the floor constructions considered. Thus a new set of reference values has been derived, {{based on the assumption that}} the NR-curves provide a correct subjective rating system for walking noise. In addition, due account has been taken of the different frequency content at higher frequencies of impact noises other than those made by walking males, such as those made by walking females, jumping children, the moving of furniture, etc. © 1976...|$|R

METRICS The IIC 4 fitting procedure differs in only two respects from the ISO 3 Lnw procedure: data are rounded to the nearest decibel instead of to the nearest 0. 1 dB and the maximum deficiency allowed during the fitting procedure is 8 dB- the “ 8 dB rule”. When fitting is complete, IIC is obtained by subtracting the value of the reference contour at 500 Hz from 110. This has the effect that higher IIC numbers mean greater protection against impact sound. In contrast, the Ln,w rating decreases as the floor impact sound attenuation increases. When the 8 dB rule is not invoked, the two ratings are related by IIC = 110 - Lnw. In an informative Annex to ISO 717, spectrum adaptation terms are proposed that are meant to deal with low frequency impact sound. The sum of the adaptation term and the Lnw rating is equal to the unweighted energy sum of the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> levels minus 15 dB.
