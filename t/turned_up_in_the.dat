25|$|Scientists {{believe that}} reduced sea {{ice in the}} Northwest Passage has {{permitted}} some new species to migrate across the Arctic Ocean.

25|$|E. caucasicum, {{defined by}} Borissjak in 1914, {{flourished in the}} Black Sea region, {{as a member of}} the Early Pleistocene Tamanian Faunal Unit (1.1–0.8 Ma, Taman Peninsula).

The Khaprov is in the MIddle Villafranchian, MN17, which spans the Piacenzian of the Late Pliocene and the Gelasian of the Early Pleistocene of Northern Caucasus, Moldova and Asia and has been dated to 2.6–2.2 Ma.|$|E

25|$|Because the Festival Express tour {{turned out}} to be a {{complete}} financial disaster, the film project was shelved soon afterwards, as the promoters sued the filmmakers, and the footage mysteriously disappeared. Some of the film's reels <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage of the original producer Willem Poolman, where they had been stored for decades and used at various times as goal posts for ball hockey games played by his son Gavin. The plan to resurrect the film was started in 1999 by executive producer Garth Douglas and story consultant James Cullingham, who found many more reels in the Canadian National Film Archives vault, where it had been kept in pristine condition and unknown to the world. Garth got in touch with Gavin, who had grown up to become a London-based film producer. Gavin produced the film together with his old high school friend John Trapman (who had played in some of those ball hockey games), and Bob Smeaton, double Grammy Award-winning director of The Beatles Anthology was brought on board. The music tracks were mixed at Toronto's MetalWorks Studios, and produced by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrix's producer, and engineer for Led Zeppelin, Woodstock, and Derek & The Dominos Live In Concert.|$|E
25|$|Sheila's baby died, {{unbeknownst to}} Scott, and she {{secretly}} switches Lauren's newborn {{with a black}} market baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from meningitis. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually {{found out about the}} baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee table, setting the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator Paul Williams, and his secretary, Lynne Bassett. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ashes. The corpse {{turned out to be a}} meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in Los Angeles. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, Scott Jr.|$|E
500|$|MGM's {{special edition}} of the 1981 film was not {{released}} until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared. [...] The workprint containing deleted scenes finally <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hutchinson, Kansas salt mine film depository. [...] The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: [...] "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there." [...] The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.|$|E

500|$|In May 2012, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Party" [...] {{during her}} [...] revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. Rebecca Thomas of MTV News described the performance, [...] "For {{one of our}} favorite numbers, 'Party,' the 4 singer donned full-on showgirl regalia in a heady rendition that saw confetti coming from the roof and dice-shaped beach balls being tossed through the crowd as dancers in large feathered headdresses magically <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aisles." [...] Both, Maura Johnston of The Village Voice and Tris McCall of New Jersey On-Line noted that the confetti should have been dropped during the first or the last song.

500|$|With Zephyr-mania {{sweeping}} the country, tributes <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> names {{of everything from}} sports teams to commercial products. [...] In 1934, Father Becker, principal of the newly built St. Mary High School in Menasha, Wisconsin, was so inspired by the dawn-to-dusk run that he chose [...] "Zephyrs" [...] as the mascot for the new school. [...] In Galesburg, Illinois, which is 162 rail miles from Chicago, {{the local high school}} named all its athletic teams the [...] "Galesburg Silver Streaks" [...] in honor of the train. [...] In 1935, the H. N. White Company changed the name of its top-line saxophones to [...] "King Zephyr." [...] Ford Motor Company introduced the [...] "Lincoln-Zephyr" [...] with the 1936 model year. [...] If advertisers {{could find a way to}} cash in on Zephyr-mania, they did.|$|E
500|$|When {{the musicians}} reconvened the {{following}} day, June 16, Al Kooper joined the proceedings. Kooper, {{at that time}} a 21-year-old session guitarist, was not originally supposed to play but was present in the studio as Wilson's guest. When Wilson stepped out, Kooper sat down with his guitar with the other musicians, hoping {{to take part in}} the recording session. By the time Wilson returned, Kooper, who had been intimidated by Bloomfield's guitar playing, was back in the control room. After a couple of rehearsal takes, Wilson moved Griffin from Hammond organ to piano. Kooper then approached Wilson and told him he had a good part for the organ. Wilson belittled Kooper's organ skills but didn't explicitly forbid him to play. As Kooper later put it, [...] "He just sort of scoffed at me... He didn't say 'no'—so I went out there." [...] Wilson was surprised to see Kooper at the organ but allowed him to play on the track. When Dylan heard a playback of the song, he insisted that the organ be <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mix, despite Wilson's protestations that Kooper was [...] "not an organ player." ...|$|E

2500|$|While limited {{attempts}} to give Maggie and Mickey storylines were made, {{for over a}} decade, they were relegated to supporting status, often off the front burner and with relative little airtime.

In 2003, a major series of serial killings occurred on the show. Maggie was [...] "killed off" [...] in a [...] "whodunnit?" [...] murder storyline involving a serial killer. Maggie's murder forced Rogers to depart from the series. To help with falling ratings at the time, head writer James E. Reilly decided to bring all the characters back from the dead.
