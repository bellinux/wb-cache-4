5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> fed {{mostly on}} low growth {{because of the}} {{position}} of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>probably</b> {{first met}} {{personally}} in November 1881, though Narendra {{did not consider}} this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later. At this time Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture. According to Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.|$|E

5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in English {{cities in the}} Middle Ages, Canterbury {{employed}} a town band known as the Waits. There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> existed earlier than this. The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile. Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. A modern early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Major General Ironside {{launched}} his offensive against the 6th Red Army, with the British force subsequently inflicting {{large numbers of}} casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought through thick pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged in holding operations only. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> had no intention of interrupting the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. To be sure the main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at any one time, and P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 10th century and early 9th century BC, {{the site was}} reoccupied but its name during that time is unknown; three human head sculptures made of basalt were {{discovered}} in the site; <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> date to the mid-9th century BC. At this time, the region was probably {{under the control of}} Palistin, with Qatna under the rule of Hamath, which was probably part of Palistin. The basalt heads bear similarities to a statue discovered in Palistin's capital, but there is not enough information to allow a general conclusion over the borders of Palistin and its extent into Qatna. The settlement was a small one; it included large buildings that were used both as residences and manufacturing facilities.|$|E
5|$|Kafka's parents {{probably}} spoke a German {{influenced by}} Yiddish that was sometimes pejoratively called Mauscheldeutsch, but, as the German language {{was considered the}} vehicle of social mobility, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> encouraged their children to speak High German. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They all died during the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland in 1942, {{but that is the}} last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favorite sister.|$|E

5|$|Plesiorycteropus, {{also known}} as the bibymalagasy or Malagasy aardvark, is a {{recently}} extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar. Upon its description in 1895, it was classified with the aardvark, but more recent studies have found little evidence to link it to aardvarks or any other order of mammals. Molecular evidence instead suggests that it is related to the tenrecs. Two species are currently recognized, the larger P.madagascariensis and the smaller P.germainepetterae. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> overlapped in distribution, as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site.|$|E
5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|The final {{process of}} the {{differentiation}} of the cultures recognized as early Slavic, the Kolochin culture] (over {{the territory of the}} Kiev culture), the Penkovka culture and the Prague-Korchak culture, took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE. Beyond the Post-Zarubintsy horizon, the expanding early Slavs took over much of the territories of the Chernyakhov culture and the Dacian Carpathian Tumuli culture. As not all of the previous inhabitants from those cultures had left the area, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Persian ships and men {{involved}} with the battle are, as so often in the Greco-Persian Wars, somewhat problematic. It {{is clear that the}} Persian fleet did not dare conduct operations against the Greeks, and thus must have been approximately equal to, or smaller than the Greek fleet. Herodotus gives the size of the Persian fleet at 300 ships; the Greeks had 378 at Salamis, but must have suffered significant losses, and so <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> also had around 300 in total (though not necessarily all these ships formed part of the allied fleet for 479 BC). The Phoenician ships were dismissed from the Persian fleet before the battle, which reduced its strength further.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} Neolithic causewayed {{enclosures}} is unclear, and <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> had {{a variety of}} functions. As well as burials, indicating the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas {{to the east and}} west indicate it was used as a meeting place which attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{military}} sites continues from the Iron Age into the Roman period; two Roman forts in Greater Manchester are scheduled monuments {{and were the}} two main areas of Roman activity in the county. Of the nine castles in Greater Manchester, four are scheduled monuments: Buckton Castle, Watch Hill Castle, Bury Castle, and Radcliffe Tower. The last two are fortified manor houses, and although defined as castles were not exclusively military in nature; <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> acted as the administrative centre of the manors they were in. There are several other manor houses and country houses some with moats in the county that are protected as scheduled monuments. The Astley Green Colliery, the Marple Aqueduct, Oldknows Limekilns, and the Worsley Delph are scheduled relics of Greater Manchester's industrial history.|$|E
