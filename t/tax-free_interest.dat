The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008. The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 {{as part of a larger}} crackdown in Brazil. Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.

2500|$|HSAs {{are seen}} by proponents {{as a way}} to make {{healthcare}} more affordable and accessible in the U.S. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which included provisions designed to stimulate the popularity of these plans, was passed by Congress in November 2003 and signed into law by President Bush in December 2003. The law expanded medical savings accounts, renaming them Health Savings Accounts and created tax incentives to encourage adoption of high-deductible health plans. Banks were empowered to create HSAs, which deliver <b>tax-free</b> <b>interest</b> to the holders, who can then withdraw money tax free to pay for qualified expenditures. To qualify for an HSA, the purchaser must also have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance plan. Over time, participants are allowed to contribute more (cumulatively) to the savings account than would be required to fulfill their annual deductible for a given year (although annual limits on pre-tax contributions [...] are well below the annual deductible), and any unused portions of the account accrue without tax penalty so long as the funds are used only for qualified medical expenses.|$|E

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be <b>tax-free</b> on mortgage <b>interest</b> (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|R

40|$|A welfare loss {{of about}} 5 to 6 per {{cent of the}} capital stock is {{estimated}} to result from {{the introduction of a}} tax on real domestic interest receipts in the 1983 Finnish economy. Firstly. a review {{of the history of the}} tax treatment of interest income and of the proposal to change it are presented. It is pointed out that prior to the year of 1983 the Finnish economy operated approximately so that no tax wedge was included in the domestic average lending rates. Secondly, the effects of the imposition ofa tax in such circumstances on domestic interest rates is analysed graphically in the presence of international capital flows. It is observed that if the domestic (foreign) investors determine solely the domestic <b>tax-free</b> <b>interest</b> rates, the tax will shift 100 per cent forward (backward). Hence. a welfare loss results in the form of reduced domestic investment (saving). Thirdly, limitations and crucial parameter values of the applied three-sector general equilibrium model are explained. and there is also a description of how the proposed reform is tackled in the model. Finally, the consumer's equivalent variation is calculated for each successive year by comparing the new utility level to the one along the reference path. The present value of those un weighted losses in relation to the capital stock gives the welfare loss. ...|$|E
