5|$|NextWorth is an {{electronics}} <b>trade-in</b> and recycling service. Users {{of the service}} exchange used electronics for cash or discounts on newer models. NextWorth was founded by business students at Babson College in 2005. It started as a commission-based service to help businesses setup online auctions for their used items, then changed its business model to focus on electronics trade-ins in 2006. As of late 2012, NextWorth {{was one of the}} best-known and largest electronics <b>trade-in</b> and recycling services in the United States, although it handles {{only a small percentage of}} total <b>trade-in</b> traffic.|$|E
5|$|Sellers {{can also}} do trade-ins {{in-person}} and get reimbursed immediately at partnered retailers like Target. The Target <b>trade-in</b> program {{began as a}} pilot project in 2009, and expanded to 190 locations by 2010 and almost 1,500 stores by 2011. A similar partnership was in place with Circuit City before it {{went out of business}} in 2009. A company spokesperson stated in 2009 that the company was also partnered with 15 smaller retailers for in-person trade-ins.|$|E
25|$|Publishers often funded <b>trade-in</b> {{deals to}} {{encourage}} consumers to purchase new games. <b>Trade-in</b> customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed {{about a third}} of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former <b>trade-in</b> retail executives behind the <b>trade-in</b> price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's <b>trade-in</b> industry was {{about a third of}} the size of its new games business. They figured that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's <b>trade-in</b> market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the <b>trade-in</b> values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate <b>trade-in</b> deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical investigation of adverse selection in the wholesale used car market. New car dealers (who sell both new and used cars) differ from used car dealers (who sell only used cars) in the propensity to sell <b>trade-ins</b> on the wholesale market. Models of adverse selection {{suggest that the}} dealer type that sells {{a higher proportion of}} its <b>trade-ins</b> on the wholesale market will sell, on average, cars of higher quality and receive in return a higher price. A survey of dealers' wholesale behavior and prices collected at a wholesale auction are used to test this prediction. Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R

In an effort to further distance themselves from the troubled Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans an opportunity to <b>trade-in</b> Hernandez jerseys for another jersey of comparable value. Hernandez would be convicted of the murder charge and sentenced to life imprisonment in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|Under a buyback {{program called}} the Resale Value Guarantee {{available}} in 37 U.S. states, a Tesla Model S sold before July 1, 2016 included {{the right to}} return it after three years with reimbursement of 43% to 50% of its initial price. This reimbursement matched the <b>trade-in</b> values of competitive German luxury cars of that age. In addition to maintaining the resale value, Tesla hoped to secure a supply of used cars to refurbish and re-sell with warranty. According to Automotive News, the profit margin on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's direct sales would allow it capture resale profits. Tesla ended the program in 2016 although they retained the Residual Value Guarantee on leased vehicles.|$|E

He also voted to pass a bill, <b>Trade-in</b> Vouchers for Fuel-Efficient Cars, in 2009 which granted a $3,500 voucher, or document that could be exchanged for services {{in the place of}} money, for trading in an old vehicle with at least 4 miles per gallon more, the purpose of which was to increase the purchasing of fuel efficient cars.

50|$|Sales Promotion is {{media and}} non-media {{marketing}} communication {{used for a}} pre-determined limited time to increase consumer demand, stimulate market demand or improve product availability.

50|$|New car dealerships also sell used cars, {{and take}} in <b>trade-ins</b> and/or {{purchase}} used vehicles at auction. Most dealerships also provide a series of additional services for car buyers and owners, which are sometimes more profitable than the core business of selling cars.|$|R
25|$|The games industry's {{shift from}} brick and mortar retail to digital {{downloads}} {{led to a}} severe sales decline at video game retailers such as GameStop, following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as Blockbuster, Tower Records, and Virgin Megastores. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its <b>trade-in</b> program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games. The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer Game revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments. The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles, as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail. Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.|$|E
25|$|This {{is due in}} part to the {{reduction}} in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years is up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or <b>trade-in</b> value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's depreciation costs or financing costs.|$|E
500|$|NextWorth has {{experienced}} spikes in <b>trade-in</b> activity from sellers when newer models are announced, {{such as when}} the iPad 2 was announced in March 2011, and when the iPhone 5 was announced in September 2012 These [...] announcements also caused the <b>trade-in</b> price of older models to decrease, due to over-supply. as well as after the holiday season.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Department of Transportation {{ruled that}} deals {{involving}} cash-for-clunkers <b>trade-ins</b> based on old EPA mileage numbers and consummated before July 24 would be honored, but that deals consummated after July 24 on vehicles that became ineligible as clunkers due to mileage ratings changes {{would not be}} honored.|$|R
50|$|Dealers often obtain {{these reports}} {{that provide a}} {{detailed}} background on the used vehicle to show their customers. Dealers also run reports prior to acquiring vehicles at auction or from <b>trade-ins</b> to help ensure they pay a fair market value. Vehicle prices may be adjusted due to history events on any particular vehicle.|$|R
500|$|NextWorth sets its prices {{through an}} {{algorithm}} developed by MBA {{students and a}} professor at Babson College. Sellers can obtain better prices by reselling their electronics directly through services like eBay or Craigslist, but services like NextWorth are more convenient and have predictable pricing. A CNET editor found most of the <b>trade-in</b> prices at NextWorth to be [...] "pretty fair", though he was expecting higher prices for some items. Variations in price between <b>trade-in</b> services and products depend on timing (release of new models and market fluctuations), the model being sold, and the product's condition.|$|E
500|$|The {{store is}} also known for giving more credit for trade-ins than its competitors.
