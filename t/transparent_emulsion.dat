50|$|The term {{microemulsion}} {{was first}} used by T. P. Hoar and J. H. Shulman, professors of chemistry at Cambridge University, in 1943. Alternative names for these systems are often used, such as <b>transparent</b> <b>emulsion,</b> swollen micelle, micellar solution, and solubilized oil. More confusingly still, the term microemulsion can refer to the single isotropic phase that {{is a mixture of}} oil, water and surfactant, or to one that is in equilibrium with coexisting predominantly oil and/or aqueous phases, or even to other non-isotropic phases. As in the binary systems (water/surfactant or oil/surfactant), self-assembled structures of different types can be formed, ranging, for example, from (inverted) spherical and cylindrical micelles to lamellar phases and bicontinuous microemulsions, which may coexist with predominantly oil or aqueous phases.|$|E
40|$|Nanoemulsion {{has been}} {{identified}} as a promising delivery system for various drugs including biopharmaceuticals. Nanoemulsion is a heterogeneous system composed of one immiscible liquid dispersed as droplets within another liquid. The droplets size of nano emulsion is between 20 to 500 nm. Diameter and surface properties of droplets of nanoemulsion {{plays an important role in}} the biological behavior of the formulation. Small droplet sizes lead to <b>transparent</b> <b>emulsions</b> so that product appearance is not altered by the addition of an oil phase.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was addressed to}} develop transparent microemulsions as delivery system of lemon oil. To this aim, phase inversion temperature (PIT) method was employed. The effect of the surfactant Tween 80 content as well as lipid phase type and concentration (lemon oil, peanut oil and their mixtures) on microemulsion characteristics was studied. <b>Transparent</b> <b>emulsions</b> were obtained up to 1. 3 and 7. 5 % (w/w) of lemon oil and peanut oil, respectively. Only by considering as lipid phase a mixture of lemon oil and peanut oil, {{it was possible to}} increase the delivering capacity of emulsions up to 15 % of lemon oil (total oil phase 20 %). Therefore, blending peanut oil rich in long chain fatty acids with lemon oil expanded the lipid phase loading capacity of microemulsions while maintaining particle size lower than 30 nm and thus system transparency.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{production of}} nanoemulsions, with oil droplet sizes {{of less than}} 100 nm would facilitate the inclusion of oil soluble bio-active agents into a range of water based foods. Small droplet sizes lead to <b>transparent</b> <b>emulsions</b> so that product appearance is not altered {{by the addition of}} an oil phase. In this paper, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} create remarkably small transparent O/W nanoemulsions with average diameters as low as 40 nm from sunflower oil. This is achieved using ultrasound or high shear homogenization and a surfactant/co-surfactant/oil system that is well optimised. The minimum droplet size of 40 nm, was only obtained when both droplet deformability (surfactant design) and the applied shear (equipment geometry) were optimal. The time required to achieve the minimum droplet size was also clearly affected by the equipment configuration. Results at atmospheric pressure fitted an expected exponential relationship with the total energy density. However, we found that this relationship changes when an overpressure of up to 400 kPa is applied to the sonication vessel, leading to more efficient emulsion production. Oil stability is unaffected by the sonication process. Open Acces...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his first}} patent application, filed February 11, 1913, American {{inventor}} Percy Douglas Brewster described a new color film process: The exposure is made through a ray filter, preferably light yellow {{in color and}} adapted to cut off all the violet and ultra-violet rays of light. The green and blue light {{with the addition of}} some yellow, after passing through the ray filter, acts upon the panchromatic emulsion {{on the front of the}} film, while the red and orange light with some yellow passes through the film and acts upon the panchromatic emulsion on the back of the film. The color that the <b>transparent</b> <b>emulsion</b> is stained prevents the passage of a substantial amount of blue and green light through the film to act upon the panchromatic film on the back. Over the next eight years, Brewster filed a series of further patents pertaining to photographic film, film development, color cinematography, and various improvements to the process. [...] In 1917, a patent for a method of [...] "Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images" [...] was issued to Hoyt Miller, chief chemist of the Brewster Color Film Corporation, and assigned to the corporation.|$|E
50|$|Lippmann {{made use}} of this {{phenomenon}} by projecting an image onto a special photographic plate capable of recording detail smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. The light passed through the supporting glass sheet into a very thin and nearly <b>transparent</b> photographic <b>emulsion</b> containing submicroscopically small silver halide grains. A temporary mirror of liquid mercury in intimate contact reflected the light back through the emulsion, creating standing waves whose nodes had little effect while their antinodes created a latent image. After development, {{the result was a}} structure of laminae, distinct parallel layers composed of submicroscopic metallic silver grains, which was a permanent record of the standing waves. In each part of the image, the spacing of the laminae corresponded to the half-wavelengths of the light photographed.|$|R
50|$|An {{amplitude}} modulation hologram {{is one where}} the amplitude of light diffracted by the hologram {{is proportional to the}} intensity of the recorded light. A straightforward example of this is photographic <b>emulsion</b> on a <b>transparent</b> substrate.

40|$|Emulsion-based {{delivery}} systems offer many potential benefits for incorporating omega- 3 oils into foods and beverages. Nanoemulsions are emulsion-based {{delivery systems}} that are gaining popularity because of their ease of preparation, small particle size, relatively high stability, high bioavailability, and production of optically <b>transparent</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Fish oil (FO) nanoemulsions are potentially more susceptible to lipid oxidation because of their high degree of lipid unsaturation, high surface area of exposed lipids, and greater light penetration. In the first study, spontaneous emulsification, a low-energy method, was used to fabricate FO nanoemulsions. The influence of surfactant-to-oil-ratio (SOR) on particle size, turbidity, and physical stability was evaluated. Furthermore, the oxidative stability of these nanoemulsions was compared to emulsions produced by microfluidizer, a high-energy method. The effect of particle size and SOR on oxidation was monitored by measuring lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Optically transparent nanoemulsions were formed and maintained physical stability after being held at 37 °C for 14 days. FO nanoemulsions produced by high- and low-energy methods had similar oxidative stabilities at 55 °C for 14 days. These results demonstrate that spontaneous emulsification can produce fish oil nanoemulsion that are physically stable and oxidize at similar rates as traditionally prepared nanoemulsions, and are therefore potentially suitable for fortification of clear food systems. Additionally, carrier oils can also impact the physical and oxidative stability of FO nanoemulsions. Medium chain triglycerides, lemon oil, and thyme oil were chosen as carrier oils and added to the oil phase at different ratios of FO to carrier oil for emulsions produced by the microfluidizer. Medium chain triglycerides and lemon oil produced stable FO nanoemulsions but the thyme oil only produced stable FO nanoemulsions at lower concentrations of carrier oil. On the other hand, at FO to carrier oil ratios of 75 / 25, lemon oil and thyme oil nanoemulsions had high oxidative stability because of natural of their antioxidants. These findings suggest that lemon oil and thyme oil can produce FO nanoemulsions that are physically and chemically stable {{and can be used}} for food system fortification...|$|R
40|$|Rheo-optical {{techniques}} are used here {{to probe the}} development of the morphology in <b>transparent</b> polymeric <b>emulsions.</b> The evolution of the droplet geometry is monitored in situ by means of linear conservative dichroism and flow small-angle light scattering (SALS). An interrupted step-up in shear rate is used to generate distorted droplets. Once the flow rate is stopped the droplets can relax either by retraction or by breakup. These relaxation mechanisms can be distinguished by the techniques used here, and structural relaxation times can be derived from either dichroism or light scattering experiments. During filament breakup the SALS pattern exhibits two secondary streaks that can be associated with capillary instabilities. From the kinetics of the corresponding relaxation, the breakup time of the fibrils can be estimated. The combination of size information derived from light scattering experiments with breakup times deduced from dichroism measurements or SALS experiments also provides a new rheo-optical method for estimating the interfacial tension in transparent immiscible blends.

40|$|Fresh duck {{egg white}} (FDEW) powders and desalted duck egg white (DDEW) powders were {{produced}} {{by using a}} novel pulse-spouted bed microwave freeze dryer and a conventional freeze dryer. The desalting process of the salted egg white {{was carried out in}} {{the presence or absence of}} ultrasound pretreatment. The drying time, microstructure, apparent density, color, and functional properties (gelling, foaming, and emulsifying) of FDEW and DDEW powders obtained from both the pulse-spouted bed microwave freeze-drying (PSMFD) and a conventional freeze-drying (CFD) were studied in order to evaluate the physicochemical and functional properties of these powders. The results show that PSMFD produced FDEW powders with better color appeal (higher L and lower b), lower apparent density, as well as shorter drying time compared to the FDEW powders produced by the CFD. FDEW powders produced from PSMFD produced more <b>transparent</b> gels, <b>emulsions</b> with higher foam stability, and higher emulsifying activity index compared to the FDEW powders obtained from CFD. Regarding the powders obtained from DDEW by using PSMFD, the ultrasound pretreatment during the desalting process produced DDEW powders with higher gel strength, higher foaming capacity, higher foam stability, higher emulsion stability index, as well as shorter drying time compared to the DDEW powders in which ultrasound treatment was not carried out during the desalting process in the upstream...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} and emission characteristics of a Single Cylinder Spark Ignition engine have been investigated. The research is based on micro emulsion application as fuel in a gasoline engine. We have analyzed many micro emulsion compositions in various proportions, for predicting {{the performance}} of the Spark Ignition engine. This new technology of fuel modifications is emerging very rapidly as lot of research {{is going on in the}} field of micro emulsion fuels in Compression Ignition engines, but the micro emulsion fuel used in a Gasoline engine is very rare. The use of micro emulsion as fuel in a Spark Ignition engine is virtually unexplored. So, our main goal is to see {{the performance and}} emission characteristics of micro emulsions as fuel, in Spark Ignition engines, and finding which composition is more efficient. In this research, we have used various micro emulsion fuels whose composition varies for all the three blends, and their performance and emission characteristic were predicted in AVL Boost software. Conventional Gasoline fuel 90 %, 80 % and 85 % were blended with co-surfactant Ethanol in different compositions, and water was used as an additive for making it crystal clear <b>transparent</b> micro <b>emulsion</b> fuel, which is thermodynamically stable. By comparing the performances of engines, the power has shown similarity for micro emulsion fuel and conventional Gasoline fuel. On the other hand, Torque and BMEP shows increase for all the micro emulsion fuels. Micro emulsion fuel shows higher thermal efficiency and lower Specific Fuel Consumption for all the compositions as compared to the Gasoline fuel. Carbon monoxide and Hydro carbon emissions were also measured.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with understanding how the rate and extent of membrane permeation of a drug is affected by switching the donor delivery vehicle for different permeants and membranes. The project is funded by an industrial Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering (CASE) award with an additional sponsorship by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The interest of GSK in this research is {{in the understanding of}} how the various types of topical formulation available, such as solutions, ointments, dispersions and emulsions, influence the characteristics of drug transport across a membrane. The rate and extent of membrane permeation from various types of topical formulation is experimentally investigated {{through the use of a}} developed automated method which is shown to be accurate and highly reproducible. The developed method incorporates stirred donor and re-circulating receiver compartments and continuous monitoring of the permeant concentration in the receiver phase. In a theoretical model based on rate-limiting membrane diffusion, an explicit set of equations are derived showing how the permeation extent and rate depend mainly on the membrane-donor and membrane-receiver partition coefficients of the permeant. The permeation of drug molecules from simple, single phase donor solutions are first investigated. The experimental permeation results for systems containing all possible combinations of hydrophilic or hydrophobic donor solvent, permeant and polymer membrane are measured using the developed method and are then compared to the calculated theoretical results. A quantitative comparison of model and experimental results from the widely-differing permeation systems successfully enables the systematic elucidation of all possible donor solvent effects in membrane permeation. For the experimental conditions used here, most of the permeation systems are in agreement with the model, demonstrating that the model assumptions are valid. In these cases, the dominant donor solvent effects arise from changes in the relative affinities of the permeant for the donor and receiver solvents and the membrane and are quantitatively predicted using the separately measured partition coefficients. It is also shown how additional donor solvent effects can arise when switching the donor solvent causes one or more of the model assumptions to be invalid. These effects include a change in rate-limiting step, permeant solution non-ideality and others. The development of a new type of formulation is investigated whereby the preparation of waterless, particle-stabilised emulsions is reported upon. The prepared emulsions incorporate a non-aqueous polar liquid phase, an immiscible oil phase and are stabilised by solid nanoparticles. Variation of the incorporated oil, polar liquid and particle hydrophobicity allow for the preparation of stable emulsions containing a wide range of liquids of both oil-in-polar liquid and polar liquid-in-oil emulsion types. The prepared formulations show great potential as vehicles for use in drug delivery in the pharmaceutical industry. These waterless emulsions provide several advantages such as high emulsion stability, aesthetic textures for topical application, aesthetic appearances (including the preparation of <b>transparent</b> <b>emulsions</b> through matching of the refractive index of the liquid phases) and the capability of containing very high hydrophobic drug concentrations dissolved within due to the absence of an aqueous liquid phase. The permeation of a drug molecule from more complex multiphase donor formulations, such as particle dispersions and particle stabilised emulsions, is also investigated. The delivery of a permeant across a synthetic membrane from both conventional oil-water and the developed waterless emulsions is discussed. The same experimental technique as that used to investigate the membrane permeation from single phase donor solutions is employed and a comparison of the experimental results to those calculated using the derived theoretical model is given. The theoretical model is adapted to account for the additional partioning of the permeant between the multiple phases present in these more complex donor formulations, but maintains the same set of underlying assumptions and fundamental principles of diffusion. The model successfully accounts for the experimental observations and reveals information regarding the mechanism of drug delivery from particle-stabilised emulsions. It is conclusively illustrated that permeant delivery from particle-stabilised emulsions occurs via partitioning of the drug between the dispersed and continuous emulsion phases prior to partitioning to the membrane exclusively from the emulsion continuous phase (i. e. dispersed emulsion droplet adhesion onto the surface of the membrane does not occur). Through analysis of the derived theoretical model, the extent and rate of membrane permeation of a permeant are correctly predicted to be independent of the emulsion type (i. e. oil-in-water or water-in-oil) and emulsion dispersed volume fraction for a given emulsion composition...|$|R
40|$|The poster {{provides}} and {{overview of}} the research project MAP-EASES (Fundamental and Applied Studies in Emulsion Stability) supported by the European Space Agency. The project is aimed at understanding the relationships between interfacial properties of surfactant adsorption layers at liquid-liquid interfaces and the stability and properties of the corresponding emulsions. The research programme also includes the investigation of particle-stabilised emulsions. These emulsions are widely diffuse in nature (Pickering emulsions) and have an increasing importance for different products, technologies and application subjects. Synthetic micro/nano-size particles, often in association with surfactants, are then being investigated to be utilised as new emulsion and foam additives, capable to provide long-term stability. On the other side, for some technologies {{it is important to}} understand the mechanisms underlying the particle stabilisation capability, in order to destabilise very stable emulsions, such as some crude oils. In order to respond to these fundamental and technological needs, the EASES project covers a wide spectrum of investigations and modelling: from the interaction of surfactants with particles, to droplet dynamics in emulsions, passing through the properties of single liquid-liquid interfaces and films. Benchmark experiments are planned onboard the International Space Station (ISS), exploiting the purely diffusive conditions and the absence of buoyancy, which allows for the accurate investigation of interfacial properties and of the fundamental processes involved in emulsion destabilisation. To this aim, specific innovative diagnostics have been conceived in the framework of the project, which have been realised by ESA into suitable experiment modules for the ISS. In particular, the experiment container EASES for the Fluid Science Laboratory, has been developed to produce emulsions and investigate collective properties of the emulsion, such as, destabilisation process and droplets interaction and dynamics. The module allows for the serial investigation of emulsion samples of different nature (water-in-oil, oil-in-water, surfactant-stabilised, particle stabilised) and composition (water/oil ratio, surfactant and particle concentrations) by means of two diagnostics. Optical microtomography is utilised for the investigation of <b>transparent</b> (dilute) <b>emulsions,</b> while a technique based on a Differential Scan Calorimeter allows for the investigation of opaque (concentrate) emulsions. Properties of oil-water interfaces relevant for emulsion stability, such as dilational viscoelasticity of surfactant adsorbed layers and surfactant adsorption kinetics, are instead investigated by means of the facility EASTER (Facility for Adsorption and Surface Tension), based on Capillary Pressure Tensiometry...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{preparation}} of highly <b>transparent</b> oil-in-water Pickering <b>emulsions</b> using contrast-matched organic nanoparticles. This is achieved via addition of judicious amounts of either sucrose or glycerol to an aqueous dispersion of poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) 56 -poly(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate) 500 [PGMA-PTFEMA] diblock copolymer nanoparticles prior to high shear homogenization with an equal volume of n-dodecane. The resulting Pickering emulsions comprise polydisperse n-dodecane droplets of 20 - 100 μm diameter and exhibit up to 96 % transmittance across the visible spectrum. In contrast, control experiments using non-contrast-matched poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) 56 -poly(benzyl methacrylate) 300 [PGMA 56 -PBzMA 300] diblock copolymer nanoparticles as a Pickering emulsifier only produced conventional highly turbid emulsions. Thus contrast-matching of the two immiscible phases is a necessary but not sufficient condition for {{the preparation of}} highly transparent Pickering emulsions: {{it is essential to}} use isorefractive nanoparticles in order to minimize light scattering. Furthermore, highly transparent oil-in-water-in-oil Pickering double emulsions can be obtained by homogenizing the contrast-matched oil-in-water Pickering emulsion prepared using the PGMA 56 -PTFEMA 500 nanoparticles with a contrast-matched dispersion of hydrophobic poly(lauryl methacrylate) 39 -poly(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate) 800 [PLMA 39 -PTFEMA 800] diblock copolymer nanoparticles in n-dodecane. Finally, we show that an isorefractive oil-in-water Pickering emulsion enables fluorescence spectroscopy to be used to monitor the transport of water-insoluble small molecules (pyrene and benzophenone) between n-dodecane droplets. Such transport is significantly less efficient than that observed for the equivalent isorefractive surfactant-stabilized emulsion. Conventional turbid emulsions do not enable such a comparison to be made because the intense light scattering leads to substantial spectral attenuation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 A {{complete}} {{analytical model}} of radiative and convective heat {{transfer to a}} horizontal tube in small and large particle gas fluidized beds has been developed. In the model the bed of particles consists of an emulsion phase and a bubble phase. The emulsion phase is approximated {{by a series of}} transmitting alternate layers of gas and solid. The transmissivity of the solid slabs is obtained by treating the voids in the bed as windows through which radiation is transmitted to the immersed surface. The gas layer, the gas within the voids and the gas in the bubble are considered to be radiatively <b>transparent.</b> Within the <b>emulsion</b> phase, radiosites for all solid slab surfaces in addition to the heat transfer surface are obtained by an iterative scheme with the transmission effect included. The convective boundary condition is obtained by treating the bed as a series of contact resistances from particle to particle, starting with the initial resistance between the first layer of particles and the immersed surface. A one-dimensional unsteady conduction analysis is employed using an implicit finite difference technique to determine the temperature distribution at the surfaces and inside the solid slabs. The gas convection contribution from the emulsion phase is based upon the Adams-Welty model and justified to be an additive term. Gas convection heat transfer from the bubble phase is also included using an existing model. Radiation heat transfer through the bubble phase is obtained by considering a three-dimensional hemispherical bubble surface adjacent to a horizontal tube. The total heat transfer to the immersed surface is determined by adding the contributions of both emulsion and bubble phases, weighted by their contact fractions. Results obtained with the model show that the radiant energy transmitted through the voids increases the heat transfer by about 25...|$|R
