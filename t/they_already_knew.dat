As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces {{were forced to}} retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.|$|E

500|$|The show's {{original}} three lifelines were [...] "50:50", {{in which}} the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers; [...] "Phone-a-Friend", which allowed the contestant to make a 30-second call to {{one of a number}} of friends (who provided their phone numbers in advance) and read them the question and answer choices, after which the friend provided input; and [...] "Ask the Audience", in which audience members use touch pads to designate what they believe the correct answer to be, after which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant. 50:50 was eliminated at the end of the show's sixth syndicated season, only to be restored in season fourteen. Phone-a-Friend was removed on the episode aired January 11, 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using search engines and other Internet resources, unfairly privileging individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline where friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew.</b> From 2004 to 2008, there was a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, {{in which the}} computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question.

In the wake of the departure of French officers in 1954 after Lao independence, these few junior officers suddenly rose in rank and responsibilities, becoming field grade officers. Lao sergeants and corporals were promoted to company commands as officers. At the top of the rank structure, generals were commissioned into the army from civilian life, with no military experience.

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot in 35 days over a 53-day period. As usual Panahi used non-professional actors, with the {{exceptions}} of Fatemeh Naghavi and Fereshteh Sadre Orafaiy. He saw the lead actress, Nargess Mamizadeh, in a park one day and immediately offered her the role. The film opens with one long, handheld shot that lasts over three minutes and took 13 attempts to achieve. Panahi adopted a different camera style to depict {{each of the four}} main protagonists' lives. For the first, an idealistic woman he used a handheld camera. For the second woman, the camera is mounted on a constantly moving dolly. The third woman's story is told at night in darker outside, and the camera is static with pans and tight close ups. For the last, least optimistic woman both the camera and the woman are completely immobile and very little sound is used. Panahi submitted the film to the Venice Film Festival without getting a permit from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. At the festival it won the Golden Lion, the FIPRESCI prize, the UNICEF prize, the Ecumenical Special Mention, the Sergio Trazzati Award and Mamizadeh won the Italian Film Journalist's Award for Best Actress. The Ministry of Culture and Guidance issued a permit for the film a few days before its screening at the festival, although <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> that it had been submitted illegally. The Ministry later banned the film in Iran. Panahi was worried that the Ministry would [...] "confiscate and mutilate" [...] all copies of the film, so he made multiple copies and hid them all over Iran. Irans's Cinema Deputy Mohammad-Hassan Pezeshk said that The Circle was banned because it had [...] "such a completely dark and humiliating perspective."

Phone-a-Friend was removed from the U.S. version beginning with the episode that aired on 11 January 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using web search engines and other Internet resources to assist them, which unfairly privileged individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew.</b> From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. version had a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, in which the computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question.

2500|$|The book sold very well, {{and while}} some {{anatomical}} experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig Rütimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the Archiv für Anthropologie wondered about {{the claim that the}} work was [...] "popular and scholarly", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost [...] "scrupulosity and conscientiousness" [...] and an artist must [...] "not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes" [...] which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, [...] "one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [...] embryo of the dog, the chick, [...] the turtle." [...] He accused Haeckel of [...] "playing fast and loose with the public and with science", and failing {{to live up to the}} obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned [...] "embryo of a mammal or bird". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clichés) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this [...] "extremely rash foolishness" [...] had occurred in undue haste but was [...] "bona ﬁde", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.|$|E

Producer Corinne Hollingworth has commented, [...] "we'd decided on Steve [...] and Ross [...] and we knew the sort of round, open face we needed. We saw Danniella (Westbrook) first and liked her, then saw some others, but came back to her." [...] The actress, {{a graduate of the}} Sylvia Young Theatre School, had already appeared in the soap aged 11, as an extra who rollerskated across the soap's fictional setting of Albert Square in front of the characters Den and Angie Watts. At the time, Westbrook's local paper ran a story on her with the punchline, [...] "who knows, one day she might be the show's star". Eighty girls auditioned for the part of Sam, but these eighty were eventually whittled down to four. On her final casting callback, Westbrook bumped into actors Michelle Gayle and Sid Owen, who were already on the EastEnders cast as Hattie Tavernier and Ricky Butcher respectively. Westbrook already knew Gayle, whose character was to be Sam's screen best friend, and she introduced her to Owen, whose character was scripted to be Sam's boyfriend. According to Westbrook, she liked Owen right from the start and was amused by his response of [...] "You're a bit of alright. You can be Sam!". On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance. Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, [...] "they told me they were looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted." [...] In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a [...] "flirty backward glance", causing him to walk into a lamp-post. Westbrook was initially given a three-month contract with the soap, but halfway through her contract the producers extended it as they felt [...] "the character of Sam had gelled well with the others and they wanted to include her in more storylines".|$|E
