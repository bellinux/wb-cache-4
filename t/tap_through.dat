40|$|Detection and {{elimination}} of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes depends on recognition of virus-derived peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. A critical {{step in this}} process is the translocation of peptides from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Here, we identified the bovine herpesvirus 1 -encoded UL 49. 5 protein as a potent inhibitor of TAP. The expression of UL 49. 5 results in down-regulation of MHC class I molecules at the cell surface and inhibits detection and lysis of the cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. UL 49. 5 homologs encoded by two other varicelloviruses, pseudorabies-virus and equine herpesvirus 1, also block TAP. Homologs of UL 49. 5 are widely present in herpesviruses, acting as interaction partners for glycoprotein M, but in several varicelloviruses UL 49. 5 has uniquely evolved additional functions that mediate its participation in TAP inhibition. Inactivation of TAP by UL 49. 5 involves two events: inhibition of peptide transport through a conformational arrest of the transporter and degradation of TAP by proteasomes. UL 49. 5 is degraded along with TAP via a reaction that requires the cytoplasmic tail of UL 49. 5. Thus, UL 49. 5 represents a unique immune evasion protein that inactivates <b>TAP</b> <b>through</b> a unique two-tiered proces...|$|E

30|$|In IEEE 802.11 f [17], an STA {{maintains}} {{association with}} a single AP and transfers security context information through the CAP to the TAP. This protocol is not directly applicable for inter-domain HOs and only covers intra-ESS HOs [18]. Moreover, IEEE 802.11 f was not approved as a full-use standard protocol owing to its unsuitability. As alternative enhancements, IEEE 802.11 i/r were ratified to support secure roaming to the <b>TAP</b> <b>through</b> pre-authentication with a key management mechanism [19, 20]. The IEEE 802.11 i standard has {{been included in the}} revised edition of the IEEE standard 802.11 since June, 2007 [21]. Pre-authentication of IEEE 802.11 i/r enables an STA to establish a pairwise master key security association (PMKSA) with a new AP through the CAP. Once the STA successfully authenticates the new AP, the STA completes pre-authentication with a PMKSA between the STA and the TAP without performing a four-way handshake. When the STA actually roams to the coverage area of the TAP, it sends a re-association request message including the PMKSA name to the TAP. If the TAP successfully sends an association response message, the STA and the TAP directly perform a four-way handshake. In this manner, pre-authentication enables the establishment of PMKSA before an STA associates with a TAP (L 2 HO). At the same time, the STA can mitigate the delay due to pre-authentication with the TAP. Pre-authentication, however, has limitations, such as overloading on the centralized authentication server (AAA server) with {{an increase in the number}} of pre-authentication requests. Moreover, as pre-authentication is performed at the IEEE 802 layer (L 2), it cannot be applied across IP subnets (L 3) or different administrative domains.|$|E
40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critically {{important in the}} host defense against various patho-gens through presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a process resulting {{in the destruction of}} virus-infected cells. Herpesviruses interfere with CTL-mediated elimination of infected cells by various mechanisms, including inhibi-tion of peptide transport and loading, perturbation of MHC-I trafficking, and rerouting and proteolysis of cell surface MHC-I. In this study, we show that equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV- 4) modulates MHC-I cell surface expression through two different mechanisms. First, EHV- 4 can lead to a significant downregulation of MHC-I expression at the cell surface through the product of ORF 1, a protein expressed with early kinetics from a gene that is homologous to herpes simplex virus 1 UL 56. The EHV- 4 UL 56 protein reduces cell surface MHC-I as early as 4 h after infection. Second, EHV- 4 can interfere withMHC-I antigen presen-tation, starting at 6 h after infection, by inhibition of the transporter associated with antigen processing (<b>TAP)</b> <b>through</b> its UL 49. 5 protein. Although pUL 49. 5 has no immediate effect on overall surface MHC-I levels in infected cells, it blocks the supply of antigenic peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transport of peptide-loadedMHC-I to the cell surface. Taken to-gether, our results show that EHV- 4 encodes at least two viral immune evasion proteins: pUL 56 reduces MHC-I molecules on the cell surface at early times after infection, and pUL 49. 5 interferes withMHC-I antigen presentation by blocking peptide transport in the ER.

Quality drinking water brought to the <b>tap</b> <b>through</b> elaborate underground distribution systems is a critical component to our public health and economic well-being. In the USA and Canada, {{it has been the}} hallmark of our industry and cooperation. EVIDENCE OF DECLINE Our water infrastructure is now in decline after decades of service. The signs of distress surface daily as water mains break, creating floods and sink holes. The loss of water service is more than an inconvenience, since it causes significant social and economic disruptions and jeopardizes public health. THE MEASUREMENT One factor used to quantify the occurrences of failing underground pipe networks is water main break rates. Water main break rates are calculated for all pipe materials used in the transport of water to create a measurement to judge pipe performance and durability. Water main break rates can vary year to year and by utility. However, in aggregate, break rates produce a compelling story which can aid our prudent decision making as it relates to repairing and replacing our underground pipes. PURPOSE AND HIGHLIGHTS This Comprehensive Water Main Break Rate Study for the USA and Canada compiles the collective experience of 188 utilities which can be used for making future critical pipe replacement decisions. It is the desire of the researchers and participants to offer data and analysis that utility managers and elected officials can apply to the circumstances of their own operations. Highlights of the Comprehensive Water Main Break Study include a new national metric for citizens served per one mile of pipe, aggregate data on pipe material break rates, analysis of age and corrosion in failure modes, and related observations on pressure, temperature and trenchless technology practices...|$|E
40|$|Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes play an {{important}} role in the protection against viral infections, which they detect through the recognition of virus-derived peptides, presented in the context of MHC class I molecules at the surface of the infected cell. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays an essential role in MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation, as TAP imports peptides into the ER, where peptide loading of MHC class I molecules takes place. In this study, the UL 49. 5 proteins of the varicelloviruses bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV- 1 and EHV- 4) are characterized as members of a novel class of viral immune evasion proteins. These UL 49. 5 proteins interfere with MHC class I antigen presentation by blocking the supply of antigenic peptides through inhibition of TAP. BHV- 1, PRV, and EHV- 1 recombinant viruses lacking UL 49. 5 no longer interfere with peptide transport. Combined with the observation that the individually expressed UL 49. 5 proteins block TAP as well, these data indicate that UL 49. 5 is the viral factor that is both necessary and sufficient to abolish TAP function during productive infection by these viruses. The mechanisms through which the UL 49. 5 proteins of BHV- 1, PRV, EHV- 1, and EHV- 4 block TAP exhibit surprising diversity. BHV- 1 UL 49. 5 targets TAP for proteasomal degradation, whereas EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 UL 49. 5 interfere with the binding of ATP to TAP. In contrast, TAP stability and ATP recruitment are not affected by PRV UL 49. 5, although it has the capacity to arrest the peptide transporter in a translocation-incompetent state, a property shared with the BHV- 1 and EHV- 1 UL 49. 5. Taken together, these results classify the UL 49. 5 gene products of BHV- 1, PRV, EHV- 1, and EHV- 4 as members of a novel family of viral immune evasion proteins, inhibiting <b>TAP</b> <b>through</b> a variety of mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Summary An {{infected}} cell is {{recognized by the}} immune system via pathogen-derived antigenic peptides. The surface presentation of these peptides is achieved by the assembly of a MHC class I-peptide complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this PhD thesis tapasin is shown to positively influence peptide loading on MHC class I molecules in quantitative {{as well as in}} qualitative terms. Reconstituting the peptide loading defect in the B-lymphoblastoid cell line 721. 220 by the expression of tapasin induces the plasma membrane expression of long-lived MHC class I molecules carrying an optimized spectrum of peptides. Tapasin facilitates the selection of peptides in the ER by recruiting the MHC class I molecule into the TAP loading complex. The assembly of two subcomplexes is promoted by tapasin: on one hand calreticulin is recruited to the MHC molecule, {{and on the other hand}} the thioreductase ER 60 is recruited to <b>TAP</b> <b>through</b> tapasin. On the HLA alleles investigated (HLA-B* 4402 anh HLA-B 8), the bridging of both subcomplexes by tapasin leads to enhanced binding of optimal length peptides and to the improved formation of Bw 4 /Bw 6 epitopes. Soluble tapasin constructs and mouse tapasin are not able to assemble the complete loading complex consisting of the MHC molecule, calreticulin, ER 60 and TAP. In these cases a suboptimal peptide loading is observed, characterized by a reduced half-time of class I molecules on the cell surface and a lower thermostability in lysates. With the findings of this work, we can define functional domains of tapasin. It is shown, that the N-terminal domain of tapasin is essential for peptide loading onto HLA-B 8 und HLA-B 44 molecules. The deletion of only 19 amino acids at the N-terminus of tapasin abolishes surface expression of these alleles. The transmembrane region of tapasin interacts with TAP. In the presence of membrane-anchored human and murine tapasin the expression of TAP is enhanced by a factor of ten. By contrast, when the transmembrane region is missing, no enhancement of the steady-state levels of TAP were detectable. The importance of the membrane domain of tapasin has also become clear by the fact that a sole amino acid substitution (L 410 F) in the human protein sequence leads to 70 - 80 % less TAP protein expression. This point mutation putatively destroys a leucin zipper motive which partially abolishes ER retention of tapasin. </FONT...|$|E

Argumentation is considered {{as one of the}} ways to promote scientific-thinking. But studies in the area of argumentation {{in the context of the}} developing world could not be located. Therefore, this study aimed to understand and explore the processes to apply the strategies to promote students 2 ̆ 7 argumentation in a science grade seven of a public school in Karachi, Pakistan. The practical action research methodology based on cyclic model by Kemmis, McTaggart and Retallick (2004) was used to attain the aim of the study. This model is based on identifying the general idea, reconnaissance stage to identify the prevalent teaching and learning situation, planning, implementation, and monitoring of implementation process. In this study five students of class VII and one science teacher voluntarily participated. The data was collected through classroom observations, interviews, field notes, reflective journal, audio-recording of the students 2 ̆ 7 conversation, and document analysis. The data was analyzed in two steps; on-going data analysis continued throughout the data collection process, and overall data was analyzed at the completion of the implementation process. In this regard, Toulmin Argument Pattern (TAP) was used to assess students 2 ̆ 7 arguments. The results revealed that the students could construct better level of arguments by using claim, data and warrant components of <b>TAP,</b> <b>through</b> applying two different strategies. Such as: the whole-class discussion based-on students 2 ̆ 7 personal experiences along with teachers 2 ̆ 7 and students 2 ̆ 7 questioning, and Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) along with working model about the sun, earth and moon. Besides, these strategies also facilitated the development of other aspects of argument like construction of content knowledge, scientific thinking, and culture for argument including questioning, acceptance of ideas, the social dimensions of argument and decision-making during argumentation. Moreover, during debate the students proposed arguments and counter arguments but could not demonstrate scientific attitude and social-dimension of argumentation. Modeling was implemented for development of the language for argument, through this students could visualize a suggested practice and they frequently demonstrated similar use of language to question or challenge the ideas and claims of each other. Subsequently, these questions seemed to create culture of argument and reasoning discussion in the classroom. However, during modeling students could demonstrate the use of appropriate language to challenge ideas but rarely presented and supported own ideas. The study implies that argumentation should be an important component of school education; it should be a part of all science teacher education programs, textual material for teaching argumentation needs to be developed, science textbooks need to have socio-scientific, health and environmental issues and a persuasive style to develop argumentation which will bring about both conceptual understanding and scientific thinking.
