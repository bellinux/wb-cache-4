5|$|Both a {{small and}} large coat of arms existed from 1949 until 1957 based on {{representations}} of them prior to 1936. In 1957 both the large and small city coat of arms were newly arranged by the designer Eduard Ege.

5|$|Note {{that the}} overall size and crest size also {{corresponds}} to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, it seems <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, as well {{as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated.

The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E

5|$|During {{construction}} of the dam, it was anticipated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> size and scenic location of the reservoir, coupled with its proximity to urban centers, {{would make it a}} large tourist draw. A $40,000 plan was put forth to develop the reservoir for recreational activities. This entailed the {{construction of}} campsites, picnic areas, boat ramps, a landing strip, and hiking trails, including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake. Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in Central California, attracting 360,000–400,000 visitors each year.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton was {{selected}} for a second string Australian team to tour New Zealand for two months {{at the end of}} the season while the Test team departred for England. However, captain Victor Richardson and his deputy Keith Rigg withdrew, dissatisfied with the pay, leaving Fingleton as the most senior member of the team. The tour was then cancelled by New Zealand, who feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of absentees would result in a large financial loss.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> {{size of the}} reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E

As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 RobertA.Martin {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> North American wolf C.armbrusteri (Armbruster's wolf) was C.lupus. Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta {{proposed that}} C.dirus was not derived from C.lupus. In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could {{give rise to}} a larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C.dirus in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that C.lupus had given rise to the C.dirus hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Thulborn {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> tusks of heterodontosaurids {{represented a}} secondary sex characteristic. According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype specimen of the related Abrictosaurus, which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, {{who argued that}} the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype specimen of Abrictosaurus; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Front Mission was re-released for the PlayStation as Front Mission 1st, and a {{corresponding}} promotional sound track album was released as Front Mission 1st Special BGM Selection. The nine-track album contains eight tracks by Shimomura and Matsueda, arranged by Hidenori Iwasaki, and one new track by Iwasaki {{out of the}} five he composed for the remake. It was published by Square Enix on October 23, 2003 with the catalog number FM1-DA, and has a total length of 18:25. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described the album as a good sampler for the full soundtrack, and claimed that it had slightly better sound quality. He also felt that the new track was a good addition to the rest. Dave of Square Enix Music Online agreed with these praises, though he felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> amount of overlap between the promotional disc and the full soundtrack made its purchase not worthwhile.|$|E

5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> majority of the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo.

The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the {{buoyancy}} of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E
