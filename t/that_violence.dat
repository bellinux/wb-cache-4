5|$|Completed in {{the context}} of the Yugoslav wars, the film {{constitutes}} an investigation into the consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as a verdict on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described as a warning <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E
5|$|For many centuries, {{the people}} within the Nri hegemony were {{committed}} to peace. This religious pacifism was rooted in a belief <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> was an abomination which polluted the earth. Instead, the eze Nri could declare a form of excommunication from the odinani Nri against those who violated specific taboos. Members of the Ikénga could isolate entire communities via this form of ritual siege.|$|E
5|$|Jains {{agree with}} Hindus <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> in {{self-defence}} can be justified, and {{they agree that}} a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty. Jain communities accepted {{the use of military}} power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|General Recommendation No. 19 (1992) {{discusses}} [...] "violence against women." [...] Specifically, {{it states}} that [...] "the definition of discrimination includes gender-based <b>violence,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> is directed against a woman {{because she is}} a woman or that affects women disproportionately." ...|$|R

It also recognizes <b>that</b> sexual <b>violence</b> in conflict can also affect men and boys, {{as well as}} the community-wide trauma <b>that</b> sexual <b>violence</b> can inflict.|$|R
5|$|In an {{era when}} defencemen were {{expected}} to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known {{for his ability to}} score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent. He also became known for his work to reduce <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> and to increase the salaries of hockey players. His efforts were acknowledged when the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945 and {{he became one of the}} first nine players to be inducted. He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870 election, {{the first}} state in which blacks were allowed to vote, Stevenson warned <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> against them would not be tolerated. Although he relied on local {{authorities}} to suppress any incidents, he offered rewards for the apprehension of perpetrators of election-related violence. Stevenson also recommended that the carrying of concealed weapons be outlawed. The General Assembly passed the requested legislation on March 22, 1871. The law imposed small fines for the first offense, but the amount rapidly increased for subsequent infractions in order to deter repeat offenders.|$|E
5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly {{passed a resolution}} agreeing {{to submit to the}} government's terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated. The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws. The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
5000|$|We {{felt that}} doing nothing {{in a period}} of repressive {{violence}} is itself a form of <b>violence.</b> <b>That's</b> really the part that I think is the hardest for people to understand. If you sit in your house, live your white life and go to your white job, and allow the country that you live in to murder people and to commit genocide, and you sit there and you don't do anything about it, <b>that's</b> <b>violence.</b> Naomi Jaffe ...|$|R

5|$|Some {{scholars}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> and warfare, perhaps involving cannibalism, impelled the evacuations. Hints of such include dismembered bodies—dating from Chacoan times—found at {{two sites}} within the central canyon. Yet Chacoan complexes showed {{little evidence of}} being defended or defensively sited high on cliff faces or atop mesas. Only several minor sites at Chaco have evidence of the large-scale burning that would suggest enemy raids. Archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south, east, and west into the valleys and drainages of the Little Colorado River, the Rio Puerco, and the Rio Grande. Anthropologist Joseph Tainter deals at length with the structure and decline of Chaco civilization in his 1988 study The Collapse of Complex Societies.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> is not the solution to their problems.|$|E

50|$|A {{fact finding}} mission by the Sahmat {{organisation}} led by Dr. Kamal Mitra Chenoy concluded <b>that</b> the <b>violence</b> was {{more akin to}} ethnic cleansing or a pogrom rather than communal violence.

25|$|The {{calendar}} disputes {{were not}} always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> would occasionally erupt.
