40|$|BACKGROUND: Shoulder {{subluxation}} is {{a common}} secondary impairment of the upper limb following stroke. A range of supportive devices are used in rehabilitation to prevent shoulder subluxation, including hemi-slings and firm supports, such as arm troughs, however, {{there is little evidence}} regarding their efficacy. AIM: To determine whether a modified lap-tray during sitting and a <b>triangular</b> <b>sling</b> during standing is more effective than a hemi-sling in preventing shoulder subluxation, pain, contracture and upper limb activity limitation after stroke. DESIGN: A prospective, randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Three inpatient rehabilitation units in Australia and Norway. POPULATION: Forty-six acute stroke survivors within 3 weeks of stroke who were at risk of subluxation. METHOD: The experimental group used a modified lap-tray while sitting and a <b>triangular</b> <b>sling</b> while standing to support the affected arm for four weeks. The control group used a hemi-sling while sitting and standing. The primary outcome was amount of shoulder subluxation on X-ray. Secondary outcomes were upper limb activity, pain and contracture. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} groups in terms of shoulder subluxation (MD - 3 mm, 95 % CI - 8 to 3). There was a trend for the experimental group to develop less pain at rest (MD - 0. 7 out of 10, 95 % CI - 2. 2 to 0. 8) and during shoulder external rotation (MD - 1. 7 out of 10, 95 % CI - 3. 7 to 0. 3) and a trend towards having less contracture of shoulder external rotation (MD - 10 deg, 95 % CI - 22 to 2). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of other contractures and activity of the upper limb. CONCLUSION: A lap-tray during sitting combined with a <b>triangular</b> <b>sling</b> during standing is no more effective than a hemi-sling in preventing subluxation, pain, contracture and activity limitation in acute stroke survivors at risk of shoulder subluxation. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The use of a lap-tray during sitting and <b>triangular</b> <b>sling</b> during standing is not indicated as an alternative to the hemi-sling to prevent shoulder subluxation in patients after stroke, so alternative strategies with proven efficacy, such as electrical stimulation, should be considered...|$|E
