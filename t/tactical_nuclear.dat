5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E

5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} {{by the spring of}} 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Production B.1 Victors were {{powered by}} the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 {{turbojets}} rated at , and was initially deployed with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon, re-deploying with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon. A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard {{by the addition of}} Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.|$|E
5|$|The F-105D entered {{service with}} the 335th TFS in September 1960, {{although}} it was not fully operational on the F-105D until early 1961. The first overseas F-105 units formed in West Germany in 1961, with the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base in May and the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base in October. Both wings had a primary <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> strike role for NATO. The F-105D was also deployed to the Pacific, with the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kadena in Okinawa converting in 1962 and the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing converting from 1963.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{accepted}} {{delivery of}} the first of 165 single seat Jaguar GR1s (the service designation of the Jaguar S) with 54(F) squadron in 1974. These were supplemented by 35 two seat trainers, the Jaguar T2 (previously Jaguar B). The Jaguar S and B had a more comprehensive nav/attack system(consisting of a Ferranti/Marconi NAVWASS (NAVigation and Weapon Aiming Sub System) and a Plessey 10 Way Weapon Control System) than the A and E models used by the French Air Force. RAF Jaguars were used for rapid deployment and regional reinforcement, and others flew in the <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> strike role, carrying the WE.177 bomb.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E

5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1965, the {{specification}} for the AFVG {{feasibility study}} was issued; according to Wood, the specification greatly resembled that {{which had been}} earlier issued for the cancelled TSR-2. The AFVG {{was to have a}} maximum speed of 800 knots at sea level and Mach 2.5 at altitude. It was required to possess a minimum combat radium of 500 nautical miles, a ferry range of 3,500 nautical miles, and the nose-mounted airborne interception radar was to have a minimum range of 60 nautical miles. Armanment was to include a pair of 30 mm cannons and a 2,500lb <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> bomb. However, the specification would be repeatedly re-drafted, the issuing of a definitive specification by Whitehall was delayed until April 1966.|$|E
5|$|From October 1951 to May 1954 Wolson was Commandant of the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. He {{then became}} {{commander}} of the Third Air Force in the United Kingdom, also becoming head of the Military Assistance Advisory Group for the United Kingdom on 1 November 1956. At the time, the Third Air Force {{was responsible for the}} only <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons in Europe, so Wilson was a logical choice as commander. After returning to the United States in July 1957, he became the Air Force member of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Development. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 July 1958 when he became Deputy Chief of Staff, Development. In a reorganization of the area on 1 July 1961, he became Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Technology.|$|E

The delivery warplanes used are F-16s and Panavia Tornados (expected to be replaced in various countries by F-35 dedicated to the nuclear mission).|$|R
50|$|Weapons Storage and Security System (WS3) is {{a system}} {{including}} electronic controls and vaults built into the floors of Protective Aircraft Shelters (PAS) on several United States and NATO military airfields all over the world. These vaults are used for safe special weapons storage, typically of <b>tactical</b> B61 <b>nuclear</b> bombs. Historically the system was also called within NATO the Weapon Security and Survivability System (WS3) or Weapons Survivability and Security System.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to this, the U.S. military can also deploy smaller [...] "tactical" [...] nuclear weapons either through cruise missiles or with conventional fighter-bombers. The U.S. maintains about 400 nuclear gravity bombs capable of use by F-15, F-16, and F-35. Some 350 of these bombs are deployed at seven airbases in six European NATO countries; of these, 180 <b>tactical</b> B61 <b>nuclear</b> bombs fall under a nuclear sharing arrangement.|$|R
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The first RAF Phantom {{unit was}} 228 Operational Conversion Unit, which was {{stood up in}} August 1968. The Phantom entered {{operational}} service in May 1969, when 6 Squadron was formed at RAF Coningsby in the tactical strike role. 54 Squadron was formed in September the same year, followed by 41 Squadron in 1972 as a tactical reconnaissance unit. A further four squadrons were formed under RAF Germany in 1970 and 1971: 2, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons, all at RAF Brüggen. Along with their conventional strike role, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons were assigned a <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> strike role under SACEUR, using weapons supplied by the United States. After initial work-up, 2 Squadron moved to and operated from RAF Laarbruch in the tactical reconnaissance role. The aircraft assigned to the two tactical reconnaissance units were fitted with a pod containing four optical cameras, an infrared linescan and a sideways looking radar.|$|E
50|$|From 1973 until 2003 the CFAS also {{operated}} SEPECAT Jaguars {{which were}} limited nuclear capable {{by using the}} <b>tactical</b> AN-52 <b>nuclear</b> bomb which were certified for supersonic flight. A total of 100 were built between 1972-1982. They were compatible with modified Mirage III fighters and later with the standard Jaguar. The Mirage 2000 was in theory capable of carrying it but never did. The AN-52's were deactivated and placed into storage in 1991.|$|R

5|$|The {{intention}} was to rationalise the industry to cut costs, and the government offered incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces. At the time, the RAF were looking to replace the English Electric Canberra light bomber in the long-range interdictor role, and the Hawker Hunter in the close air support role, while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet air defence role from the de Havilland Sea Vixen. BAC, through its English Electric subsidiary, had begun developing a new high-performance strike aircraft, the TSR-2, which was intended for long-range, low-level strike missions with conventional and <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, as well as tactical reconnaissance. Hawker Siddeley was also developing a new aircraft, based on its P.1127 V/STOL demonstrator. The P.1154 was proposed as a supersonic version that could be marketed to both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles: close air support, air superiority and fleet air defence.|$|E
5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and <b>Tactical</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully equipped nuclear weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons to the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East {{as a part of}} their contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus; the Vulcans were withdrawn as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified in the mid-1970s.|$|E
