The calculation of the parameters determining the activated areas at the shield (reference nuclide, nuclide vector in the barite concrete and horizontal and vertical reduction behaviors of activity concentration) and the activation profiles within the <b>biological</b> <b>shield</b> for unrestricted release, release restricted to permanent deposit and radioactive waste are presented. Considerations of located activation anomalies in the shield, e. g. in the vicinities of the beam-tubes, were made according to the reactor's operational history.

50|$|This {{low power}} means {{that within a}} few hours of shutdown, it is safe for {{personnel}} to enter the <b>biological</b> <b>shield,</b> as the residual radioactivity of the core has decayed to safe levels.

25|$|The molten corium {{settled in}} the bottom of the reactor shaft, forming a layer of {{graphite}} debris on its top.

40|$|Life {{extensions}} {{of nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) to 60 years of operation {{and the possibility of}} subsequent license renewal to 80 years have renewed interest in long-term material degradation in NPPs. Large irreplaceable sections of most nuclear generating stations are constructed from concrete, including safety-related structures such as <b>biological</b> <b>shields</b> and containment buildings; therefore, concrete degradation is being considered with particular focus on radiation-induced effects. Based on the projected neutron fluence values (E > 0. 1 MeV) in the concrete <b>biological</b> <b>shields</b> of the US pressurized water reactor fleet and the currently available data on radiation effects on concrete, some decrease in mechanical properties of concrete cannot be ruled out during extended operation beyond 60 years. An expansion of the irradiated concrete database is desirable to ensure reliable risk assessment for extended operation of nuclear power plants...|$|R

50|$|This {{activation}} of the coolant water requires extra <b>biological</b> <b>shielding</b> around the nuclear reactor plant. It is the high energy gamma ray in the second reaction that causes the major concern. This is why water that has recently been inside a nuclear reactor must be shielded until this radiation subsides. One to two minutes is generally sufficient.|$|R
25|$|Aneutronic fusion is {{any form}} of fusion power in which {{neutrons}} carry no more than 1% of the total released energy. The most-studied fusion reactions release up to 80% of their energy in neutrons.

50|$|The second {{accident}} was a cooling system leak which occurred in 1967, shortly after refueling.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the International Energy Agency Program on Environmental, Safety and Economic Aspects of Fusion Power, an international collaborative study on management of fusion radioactive materials has been carried out to examine the back-end of the materials cycle. The strategy for handling fusion activated materials calls for three potential schemes: clearance, recycling and disposal. There is a growing international effort to avoid the underground disposal, for fusion in particular. Plasma facing components (divertor and blanket) normally contain high radioactivity and are not clearable. As clearance of sizeable components (such as <b>biological</b> <b>shield,</b> cryostat, vacuum vessel, and some constituents of magnets) is highly desirable, we identified the source of radioisotopes that hinder the clearance of these components and investigated the impact of impurity control. Another study assessed radioactivity build-up under repeated use of the divertor made of W-La 2 O 3 alloy. Effect of impurities on activated materials management is illustrated by the examples of carbon- 14 generation and impurities activation in concrete of <b>biological</b> <b>shield.</b> We think that consideration of activated materials management scenarios presented in this paper by example of blanket and divertor replacement is of interest as wel...|$|R
40|$|Neutron cameras with {{horizontal}} and vertical views have been designed for ITER, based on systems used on JET and TFTR. The cameras consist of fan-shaped arrays of collimated flight tubes, with suitably chosen detectors situated outside the <b>biological</b> <b>shield.</b> The sight lines view the ITER plasma through slots in the shield blanket and penetrate the vacuum vessel, cryostat, and <b>biological</b> <b>shield</b> through stainless steel windows. This paper analyzes the expected performance of several neutron camera arrangements for ITER. In addition to the reference designs, the authors examine proposed compact cameras, in which neutron fluxes are inferred from {sup 16 }N decay gammas in dedicated flowing water loops, and conventional cameras with fewer sight lines and more limited fields of view than in the reference designs. It is shown that the spatial sampling provided by the reference designs is sufficient to satisfy target measurement requirements and that some reduction in field of view may be permissible. The accuracy of measurements with {sup 16 }N-based compact cameras is not yet established, and they fail to satisfy requirements for parameter range and time resolution by large margins...|$|R
