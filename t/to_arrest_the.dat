5|$|The {{next day}} the arrests were {{publicly}} queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W.C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, {{said that he had}} directly ordered the police <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it legal.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|Bramlette {{resigned}} his judgeship {{and accepted}} a commission as a {{colonel in the}} Union Army on August 7, 1861. In violation of Kentucky's agreement to remain neutral in the Civil War, he raised and commanded the 3rd Kentucky Infantry. On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to forestall a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge. A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Nghia {{showed his}} mixed {{feelings}} about the junta with the selective use of his armored troops. They supported Khánh's move against Dinh, Don, Kim and Xuan, but tried to protect Minh by using tanks to shield Minh's house from Lam's Civil Guard units, which were also used <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> four other leading junta members. Although Minh was taken away, this was {{claimed to be a}} protective measure to shield him from some of Khánh's more hawkish supporters, and he was never formally arrested and taken into detention. Throughout the morning the deposed officers were taken one by one to JGS headquarters by the plotters. The generals were then flown to My Khe beach, near Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> leading {{men of the}} nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding {{a copy of the}} Torah, destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party should be punished. This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} few months of the {{uprising}} meetings of Popular committee were legal but as the UNLU leaders were subjected <b>to</b> <b>arrests</b> <b>the</b> movement went underground. The older prominent personalities that had previously dominated Palestinian politics were supplanted by new more youthful politicians rising from the cadres of the UNLU.|$|R
5|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} the {{outbreak}} of a wider war, American officials ordered the U.S. Army <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees. General Gaines was ill, and so his subordinate, Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, received the assignment. Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 Winnebago War, {{but he had never}} seen combat. On April 8, he set out from Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.|$|E
5|$|In 2034, {{two years}} after the events of , Public Security Section 9 is {{investigating}} a string of mysterious suicides by refugees from the Siak Republic. Chief Aramaki conducts a raid <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> refugee dictator only to find him already dead. In retaliation, a Siak operative plans a terrorist attack with a micromachine virus. Batou is sent to intercept the Siak operative and encounters Kusanagi, who is conducting her own investigation. Before they can apprehend the operative, he dies while attacking them. Kusanagi takes a case of virus ampules and warns Batou {{to stay away from the}} Solid State Society before leaving.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
50|$|In {{reaction}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrest,</b> <b>the</b> {{foreign ministers}} of both France and Poland urged Switzerland to release Polanski, who holds dual citizenship of both countries, but subsequently withdrew {{their support for}} Polanski.|$|R

5|$|The Afghan Emir {{was warned}} by New Delhi of the {{approach}} of the expedition even while efforts were underway to intercept it in the Persian desert. After it crossed into Afghanistan, the Emir was asked <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> members. However, Habibullah humoured the British without obeying the Viceroy's requests. He told the Viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan. Through British channels, the Russians voiced their concerns about the Emir's tolerance of the German presence and their intrigues with Pro-German Afghan counsellors.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> Bounty mutineers. Edwards named it in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, under whom he had served earlier in his career. HMS Pandora turned northwards from Ducie and, because of this change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS Pandora had maintained its course, it would eventually have reached Pitcairn Island and found the Bounty mutineers.|$|E
5|$|There is a shop/post office {{located in}} Inverarish. Accommodation is {{available}} in the old manor of Raasay House, and at various B. There are significant numbers of incomers and holiday homes especially in the south of the island. This has helped <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> population decline from over 900 in 1803 to 194 in 2001. Some inhabitants belong to the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays there are no public services, the playground is closed and, until 2004, the ferry did not run.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes is {{probably}} identical with the patrikios Bardanios who {{appears in the}} Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor in the mid-790s. In 795, he was Domestic of the Schools (commander of the Scholai guards), and was dispatched <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> monk Plato of Sakkoudion for his public opposition to the second marriage of Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) to Plato's niece Theodote. In 797, as strategos (military governor) of the Thracesian Theme, this same Bardanios supported the Empress-mother Irene of Athens when she usurped the throne from her son. On Easter Monday, 1 April 799, he is recorded {{as one of the}} four patrikioi (along with Niketas Triphyllios, Sisinnios Triphyllios and Constantine Boilas) who led the horses of the Empress's carriage on a unique triumphal procession from the palace to the Church of the Holy Apostles.|$|E
5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Eddie {{continues}} to persuade his superiors {{to form a}} task force to hunt down the Flash, expressing his zero tolerance for vigilantes. When an enraged and jealous Barry, as Flash, makes an attempt on Eddie, Oliver tries to stop Barry, and the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use colored strobe light to reset Barry's emotional state. Afterward, Barry and Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie gets the grounds to form a police task force <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former has a lot to learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, because men with secret identities never get the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego a secret. A new metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Germans {{occupied}} Oslo and at 17:30 Norwegian radio ceased broadcasting at {{the request}} of the occupying forces. With German support, at approximately 19:30, Quisling entered the NRK studios in Oslo and proclaimed the formation of a new government with himself as Prime Minister. He also revoked an earlier order to mobilise against the German invasion. He still lacked legitimacy. Two orders—the first, to a friend in the military (Colonel Hans S. Hiorth, the commanding officer of the army regiment at Elverum) <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>the</b> government, and the second, to the Oslo chief of police—were both ignored. At 22:00, Quisling resumed broadcasting, repeating his earlier message and reading out a list of new ministers. Hitler lent his support as promised, and recognised the new Norwegian government under Quisling within 24 hours. Norwegian batteries were still firing on the German invasion force, and at 03:00 on 10 April, Quisling acceded to a German request to halt the resistance of the Bolærne fortress. As a result of actions such as these, it was claimed at the time that Quisling's seizure of power in a puppet government had been part of the German plan all along.|$|E
