500|$|During the {{creation}} of [...] God of War, the game's director David Jaffe attempted to create a version of Kratos that looked brutal but had a different appearance from what {{is considered to be}} the traditional Greek hero. The character's traditional armor was removed to show the character's individualism, and details such as hair and other [...] "flowing things" [...] were removed. Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> their head." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie Wen, {{director}} of visual development on God of War and God of War II, {{is responsible for}} designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to sketch a series of images of Kratos on napkins at a restaurant, introducing {{the idea of the}} double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design. Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid. Jaffe said of the final version of [...] the character, [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> their head." ...|$|E
2500|$|Linux ( [...] ) {{is a name}} which broadly denotes {{a family}} of free and {{open-source}} software operating system distributions built around the Linux kernel. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word [...] "Linux" [...] in their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux {{to refer to the}} operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux kernel, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common not only the kernel, but also numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU project.

2500|$|Ray Park, {{who played}} Snake Eyes in the film, {{said that the}} {{relationship}} between Jinx and his character is strictly platonic. Yung said about her character: [...] "Jinx wants to fight and she has an objective, and she’s fiery [...] Whoever is in her way is not a problem to her, she’s so focused and she just wants to get straight to the point. And with Snake Eyes, he’s such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he’s become an icon, he’s a role model. He’s Snake Eyes, he’s the coolest, he’s the best, and Jinx wants to compete with him, you know? In the test <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the beginning she wants to win and she wants to prove that she wants to be better, or at least as good as him.

The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a [...] recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking– recalled the admiral – {{is one of the most}} important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration.

2500|$|Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{called the}} first episode [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "gripping". He said, [...] "While Kat shines in Redwater, it's {{fair to say that}} Alfie seems a little bit lost and directionless in {{the first episode}}, with even scenes of him {{experiencing}} weird visions and nearly dying (twice!) seeming like time-fillers." [...] He said the characters of Agnes and Dermott had [...] "immediately caught our attention" [...] but wondered if the show would appeal to viewers who are not EastEnders fans, saying [...] "surely you have to be an EastEnders watcher to really care about Kat's quest for her son?" [...] but said [...] "for us it's a thumbs up if Redwater can keep up the suspense, surprises, gothic tone and sense of foreboding that sets it apart from EastEnders." [...] The series was reviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Afternoon Edition, where TV critic Emma Bullimore from TV Times said that it was [...] "enjoyable" [...] but more [...] "soapy" [...] and less [...] "complex" [...] than Broadchurch, and said that viewers should not expect it to be like EastEnders or Broadchurch but should [...] "accept it as a new thing", adding that it had good production values and deemed it a [...] "worthy experiment". Sinéad Garvan from Newsbeat, speaking at the same time, said that she found it [...] "weird" [...] seeing Kat and Alfie in a different setting and was more intrigued by the new characters but said that that Kat and Alfie still had the same chemistry <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> EastEnders.|$|E
