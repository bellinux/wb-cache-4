25|$|Ascending slowly is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> {{altitude}} sickness. Avoiding {{strenuous activity}} such as skiing, hiking, etc. {{in the first}} 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS. Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants, and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided. Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS. Thus, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24â€“48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.|$|E

25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June are when the infections mainly occur, because this is the time when the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> getting bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E

The names refer to Kenneth Ted Wallenius and R. A. Fisher who were the first to describe the respective distributions.|$|E
25|$|Frostbite is {{localized}} {{damage to}} skin and other tissues due to freezing. At or below , blood vessels {{close to the}} skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities. The same response {{may also be a}} result of exposure to high winds. This constriction helps to preserve core body temperature. In extreme cold, or when the body is exposed to cold for long periods, this protective strategy can reduce blood flow in some areas of the body to dangerously low levels. This lack of blood leads to the eventual freezing and death of skin tissue in the affected areas. Frostbite was responsible for over one million casualties in wars in the 20th Century.

500|$|Section four, [...] "InterOccupy", {{contains}} {{the transcript of}} {{a conference call with}} Chomsky chaired by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela on January 31, 2012, in which he answered pre-selected questions from the Occupy community. Beginning with a discussion of the media coverage of Occupy, he moves on to discuss the police repression that the movement has faced, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> such repression was to gain [...] "active public support" [...] for their cause. He considers one of the primary achievements of Occupy to have been to bring together communities to discuss and debate in a democratic forum, thereby rejecting the ideologies of selfishness proposed by the likes of Ayn Rand. Chomsky then discusses how to get the corporate sector out of politics and how to introduce greater democracy to the U.S. He rounds off this chapter with a discussion {{of the nature of the}} Republican and Democratic parties, the work of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and the role of the U.S. housing bubble in the global depression.|$|E
500|$|In an 1816 {{conversation}} with Lewis Cass, the Governor of Michigan, Tenskwatawa {{denied that he}} ordered his warriors to attack Harrison. He blamed the Ho-Chunk (also known as Winnebago) warriors in his camp for launching the attack. Other accounts also credit the Ho-Chunk for encouraging the attack and suggest that Tenskwatawa was unable to control his followers as panic set in. [...] Tenskwatawa's followers were worried by the nearby army and feared an imminent attack. They had begun to fortify the town, but not completed their defenses. During the evening, Tenskwatawa consulted with the spirits and decided that sending a party to murder Harrison in his tent was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a battle. He assured the warriors that he would cast spells that would prevent them from being harmed and confuse Harrison's army so they would not resist. The warriors moved out and began to surround Harrison's army, {{looking for a way}} to enter the camp undetected. Ben, an African-American wagon driver traveling with Harrison's army, had deserted to the Shawnee during the expedition. He agreed to lead a small group of warriors through the line to Harrison's tent. During the late night hours, he was captured by the camp sentries, taken back to the camp and bound. He was later convicted of treason but pardoned by Harrison.|$|E
2500|$|A {{day before}} the {{referendum}} Alistair Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, and then-Secretary of State for Scotland, suggested that if Shetland were to vote strongly against independence but the Scottish national vote was narrowly in favour, then a discussion should be had about Shetland becoming a self-governing crown dependency outside of independent Scotland, similar to the Isle of Man.

2500|$|Hypothermia {{occurs when}} the body core {{temperature}} drops below [...] Symptoms depend on the temperature and range from shivering and mental confusion to increased risk of the heart stopping. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures.

2500|$|Studies of {{the actions}} of each ship confirm another factor which was long suspected, that once sight contact was established, the SS Andrea Doria took an evasive action which {{increased}} the likelihood of a collision and worsened the situation.

2500|$|Trench foot is {{a medical}} {{condition}} caused by prolonged exposure of the feet to damp, unsanitary, and cold conditions at temperatures as warm as [...] for as few as 13 hours. Exposure to these environmental conditions causes deterioration and destruction of the capillaries and leads to morbidity of the surrounding flesh. Affected feet may become numb, affected by erythema (turning red) or cyanosis (turning blue) {{as a result of}} poor blood supply, and may begin emanating a decaying odour if the early stages of necrosis (tissue death) set in. As the condition worsens, feet may also begin to swell. Advanced trench foot often involves blisters and open sores, which lead to fungal infections. If left untreated, trench foot usually results in gangrene, which may require amputation. If trench foot is treated properly, complete recovery is normal, though it is marked by severe short-term pain when feeling returns. Trench foot affected tens of thousands of soldiers engaged in trench warfare in World War I. Keeping feet warm and dry, or at least changing into warm and dry replacement footgear, is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> trench foot.|$|E
2500|$|The Anglo-American {{journalist}} John Derbyshire, who {{was fired}} from the National Review for writing a similar column in 2012 titled [...] "The Talk: Nonblack Version", came to Hanson's defense, praising him for [...] "spot-on observations" [...] about race relations in modern America, through he argued that his column was much superior. In [...] "The Talk: Nonblack Version", Derbyshire, who had earlier been criticized by Hanson on his advocacy for racial stereotyping well beyond the context of traveling in high crime areas, went well beyond what Hanson had advocated, telling his children not to live in cities with black mayors, never to help a black person in distress, to avoid all public gatherings {{with large numbers of}} black people and only have a few black people as friends to avoid allegations of prejudice. Contra Coates, Derbyshire argued in support of Hanson that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being a victim of crime was: [...] "..stay well clear of crowds of unfamiliar blacks. Might application of those rules leave someone with hurt feelings? [...] Probably. [...] So in this pan we have some stranger's hurt feelings. In the other pan, we have our kids' safety.

2500|$|Virginia Stephen {{married the}} writer Leonard Woolf on 10 August 1912. Despite his low {{material}} status (Woolf referring to Leonard during their engagement as a [...] "penniless Jew") the couple shared a close bond. Indeed, in 1937, Woolf {{wrote in her}} diary: [...] "Love-makingâ€”after 25 years can't bear to be separate ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete." [...] The two also collaborated professionally, in 1917 founding the Hogarth Press, which subsequently published Virginia's novels along with works by T. S. Eliot, Laurens van der Post, and others. [...] The Press also commissioned works by contemporary artists, including Dora Carrington and Vanessa Bell. [...] Woolf believed that to break free of a patriarchal society that women writers needed a [...] "room of their own" [...] to develop and often fantasised about an [...] "Outsider's Society" [...] where women writers would create a virtual private space for themselves via their writings to develop a feminist critique of society. [...] Though Woolf never created the [...] "Outsider's society", the Hogarth Press was the closest approximation as the Woolfs chose to publish books by writers that took unconventional points of view to form a reading community. [...] Until 1930, Woolf often helped her husband print the Hogarth books as the money for employees was not there. [...] Both the Woolfs were internationalists and pacifists who believed that promoting understanding between peoples was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> another world war and chose quite consciously to publish works by foreign authors of whom the British reading public were unaware. The first non-British author to be published was the Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, the book Reminiscences of Leo Nikolaiovich Tolstoy in 1920, dealing with his friendship with Count Leo Tolstoy.|$|E
