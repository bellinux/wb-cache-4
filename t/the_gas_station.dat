The video is set in non-linear structure, as it opens with Minogue and Fletcher in a blue cadillac at a gas station, with Minogue staring inside <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> while Fletcher sits in the car after being released from jail. Several scenes feature Minogue and Fletcher in different outfits in different areas, driving and running around a hotel. There are scenes with Minogue and Fletcher fighting, being happy and playing around in there hotel room.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{special agent}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) goes to {{investigate}} the murder. The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now shows signs of body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay-phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station {{in the middle of}} the desert. A man with an injured hand learns that she is a medical doctor and fills her car with gasoline laced with water. Scully returns to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> and is told that rain got into the gas canisters.|$|E

When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole and the couple head off to find it. They stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk calls out for gas, entering through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) appears and kills Kirk with a hammer. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He sees the house and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him.|$|E

As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window and flees to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station.</b> The proprietor calms her with offers of help but then ties her up, gags her and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving {{at the same time as}} the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. The hitchhiker recognizes Sally and taunts her.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any {{sound from the}} vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, wooden frame building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from the pond and stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date that is also unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station.</b> The building features a double wall with sawdust stuffed in between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E

40|$|Any {{scheme for}} private {{antitrust}} enforcement is framed by two main questions: {{who will have}} standing – direct or indirect purchasers – and will the passing-on defense be allowed. Imagine that a cartel of oil producers forces <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> – direct purchasers – to buy petrol at a higher than competitive price. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> then raise <b>the</b> price for the final customers – indirect purchasers. When <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> sue <b>the</b> cartel, the cartelist will claim that no damage has occurred to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stations,</b> because <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> have passed on the overcharge to its final customers – the passing-on defense. In the United States, the ruling of the California Supreme Court in Clayworth v. Pfizer, alongside {{a report of the}} Antitrust Modernization Commission of 2007, spurred new debate on whether the 1970 s Federal case law should be overruled. The situation in the European Union has been even more challenging. The Court of Justice of the EU surprised everybody with two landmark cases in the early 2000 s, in which the court set up a basic scheme for private antitrust enforcement. However, neither the EU nor the Member States had the appropriate legislation in place. The article analyzes these latest developments, offering new solutions to both jurisdictions. I argue that the practice of passing on increases the total social welfare loss resulting from the existence of a cartel. To remedy the problem, I suggest a system that allows the passing-on defense, grants indirect purchasers standing, and multiplies the damages award. Such a system will lead to direct-purchaser suits being the rule, with indirect purchasers remaining subsidiary enforcers. It will also prompt the direct purchasers to commence the antitrust litigation in the proper time, thus limiting the additional social inefficiencies created by the cartel...|$|R
5|$|Scully {{learns that}} the {{lockdown}} population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion, finding {{a pile of}} body bags stored for incineration in the prison's boiler room. Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E

50|$|Carbon pricing {{sometimes}} {{charges the}} emitter and sometimes charges the fossil fuel supplier. Fortunately {{the right person}} always ends up bearing the cost imposed by the policy. The government may tax or cap an oil refinery based on all the carbon it buys {{in the form of}} oil. But the refinery does not emit 90%+ of that carbon. Instead it makes gasoline and sells that to <b>gas</b> <b>stations,</b> who sell it to drivers, who emit the carbon. In this case the refinery passes on the cost of its carbon permits or carbon tax (just as it passes on all marginal costs), and <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> pay those costs. But then <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> pass on their cost to the drivers. So drivers actually bear the cost of carbon pricing, and that is as it should be, because driving is the real reason for the emissions.|$|R

25|$|The two {{arrive at}} Ambrose, which is {{virtually}} a ghost town. Unable {{to find an}} attendant at <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> they wander into the church, disrupting a funeral. There, they meet a mechanic named Bo, who offers to sell them a fan belt after the funeral. While waiting for the services to end, Carly and Wade visit the 'House of Wax', a wax museum which itself is made of wax and is the central feature of the town. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> {{does not have the}} right size fan belt, so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face.
