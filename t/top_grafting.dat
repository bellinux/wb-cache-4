Osb.) were top grafted on 15 citrus rootstocks. Disease symptoms were conspicuous 3 months later on all 15 rootstocks tested. The presence of X. fastidiosa {{was confirmed by}} light microscopy, double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and polymerase chain reaction in rootlets and main roots of CVC-symptomatic Pera sweet orange in 11 of the 15 rootstocks tested. These results suggest that bacterial translocation from the aerial plant parts to the root system occurs but is not essential for X. fastidiosa to induce symptoms in the aerial parts. Bacterial translocation to the roots was not correlated with CVC leaf-symptom severity in the Pera scion. To determine if CVC disease could be transmitted by natural root grafts, two matched seedlings of each of four sweet orange cultivars (Pera, Natal, Valencia, and Caipira) were transplanted into single pots. One seedling rootstock of each pair was inoculated by <b>top</b> <b>grafting</b> with a CVC-contaminated budstick while the other seedling rootstock was cut but not graft inoculated. Transmission of X. fastidiosa from an inoculated plant to a noninoculated plant sharing the same pot was observed in all four sweet orange cultivars tested. Transmission was confirmed by observation of natural roots grafts between the two plants, presence of X. fastidiosa in the root grafts, and disease development in the uninoculated plants. This is the first report of transmission of CVC disease through natural root grafts...|$|E
40|$|Phenology of {{flowering}} {{is an important}} aspect in the growth cycle of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) because the performance of plant especially flowering is linked with anthesis time, time and duration of stigma receptivity, fruit formation, crossing, and seed development which determine the plant breeding programs. Research was conducted at the Kaliwining experimental station of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI). The cocoa plant was originated from <b>top</b> <b>grafting</b> seedling with the age of eight years. Design of experiment was randomized complete block design consisted of eight clones as treatment with three replications. Each plot consisted of 20 sample flowers. The parameters observed were phenology {{of flowering}} and pod maturity. Phenology of flowering observed were age of flowering, number of opened flower buds, number of flower buds that dropped before being opened, number of flower buds that dropped after being opened, and number of opening flowers that developed into tiny fruits. Observation on pod and been quality was done on pod size, pod weight, pod length, pod girth, and bean number. The result of experiment showed that difference in phenologyof flowering and age of pod maturity existed within eight cocoa clones tested. KKM 22 showed the shortest flowering age and pod maturity, and lowest number of beans. The highest success of pollination was observed on Sca 6 and KW 617. ICCRI 03, Sulawesi 03, ICCRI 07, KKM 22 and KW 617 showed relative low success of pollination, that iswas between 10 to 17. 6 %.

Os objetivos do trabalho foram avaliar o desenvolvimento de mudas de umbuzeiro e indicar a melhor idade da muda e do garfo para a realização da enxertia. A semeadura foi realizada em canteiros de madeira de 1, 5 m de largurax 10, 0 m de comprimento x 0, 15 m de altura, contendo areia lavada, sendo as sementes colocadas juntas e alinhadas em fileiras espaçadas de 5, 0 cm uma da outra. Avaliou-se a altura da muda a partir do colo da planta, do número de folhas, do diâmetro do caule a 5, 10 e 15 cm do colo, da matéria fresca e seca da parte aérea e das raízes no dia do transplante e após 60, 120, 180 e 240 dias após o transplantio. Avaliou-se também a sobrevivência das mudas com 180 dias após o transplantio, por meio da enxertia, pelo método de garfagem em fenda cheia ao topo com {{material}} propagativo (garfos) de umbuzeiros de várias procedências e idades. O delineamento utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, e as repetições foram compostas por seis plantas por parcela. Conclui-se que, a partir de seis meses depois da repicagem, as mudas do umbuzeiro podem ser enxertadas pelo método de garfagem em fenda cheia ao topo. Houve uma sobrevivência de 80 % das mudas enxertadas, estando estas prontas para o plantio em campo depois de dois meses após a enxertia. O índice de pegamento diminuiu de forma gradual ao serem usados garfos oriundos de plantas com idade acima de seis anos. The economic {{importance of}} Spondias umbuzeiro has been increased in international market {{due to its}} exotic flavor {{and the ability to}} be used in juices, ice creams and other food preparation. For this reason, the knowledge of many aspects of this species is has been investigated by many researchers and also attracted the farmers interest. The aim of this research was to evaluate the development of umbu seedlings and to indicate the best stage of the seedling and also the more appropriate stage of the fork for grafting. Seeds were sown in wood beds with 1. 5 m wide 10. 0 m long 0. 15 m high, washed sand, and placed together and aligned in rows spaced 5. 0 cm apart. The following characteristics were evaluated: seedling size, leaves number, stem diameter at 5, 10 and 15 cm from the soil, canopy and root fresh weight in the transplant date and also after 60, 120, 180 and 240 days after transplanting.

40|$|Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) {{has become}} a major {{constraint}} to cassava production in East and Central Africa. The identification of new sources of CBSD resistance is essential to deploy CBSD mitigation strategies as the disease is progressing westwards to new geographical areas. A stringent infection method based on <b>top</b> cleft <b>grafting</b> combined with precise virus titer quantitation was utilized to screen fourteen cassava cultivars and elite breeding lines. When inoculated with mixed infections of Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), the scions of elite breeding lines KBH 2006 / 18 and KBH 2006 / 26 remained symptom-free during a 16 -week period of virus graft inoculation, while susceptible varieties displayed typical CBSD infection symptoms at 4 weeks after grafting. The identified CBSD resistance was stable under the co-inoculation of CBSV, UCBSV with cassava geminiviruses (CGMs). Double grafting experiments revealed that transmission of CBSV and UCBSV to CBSD susceptible top scions was delayed when using intermediate scions of elite breeding lines KBH 2006 / 18 and KBH 2006 / 26. Nonetheless, comparison of virus systemic movement using scions from KBH 2006 / 18 and a transgenic CBSD resistant 60444 line (60444 -Hp 9 line) showed that both CBSV and UCBSV move at undetectable levels through the stems. Further, protoplast-based assays of virus titers over time showed that the replication of CBSVs is inhibited in the resistant line KBH 2006 / 18, suggesting that the identified CBSD resistance is at least partially based on inhibition of virus replication. Our molecular characterization of CBSD resistance in cassava offers a robust virus–host system to further investigate the molecular determinants of CBSD resistance...|$|R

DesignMeta-analysis of case series that used survival analysis to describe outcomes. MethodsStudies published from 1982 through 2003 were identified from electronic databases and pertinent original articles. Four series of cryopreserved arterial allografts, 10 series of cryopreserved vein allografts, three series of cold-storaged vein allografts, and 16 series of umbilical-cord vein allografts {{were included in}} separate random-effects meta-analyses. ResultsA graphical display of pooled survival curves of graft patency showed cold-storaged veins {{to have the best}} outcome in the first 4 years, followed by cryopreserved arteries, umbilical-cord veins, and cryopreserved veins. The respective 5 -year pooled patency were 24, 21, 30, and 19 %. For foot preservation, the best outcome was achieved with cryopreserved arteries followed by cryopreserved veins, umbilical-cord veins, and cold-storaged veins.

50|$|Like {{many other}} plants, grape vines are {{susceptible}} to chlorosis, and symptoms of iron deficiency tend to be common on soils rich in limestone. In the wake of The Great French Wine Blight, when European Vitis vinifera were affected by Phylloxera, chlorosis became a greater problem in viticulture. To deal with the Phylloxera blight, V. vinifera was grafted onto rootstock based on American species of the Vitis genus, such as Vitis riparia, Vitis rupestris, Vitis berlandieri. However, many of these were less adapted to the lime-rich soils that were common in France's vineyards, in particular many of those that produced wines of <b>top</b> quality. Many <b>grafted</b> vines in lime-rich vineyards therefore showed signs of iron deficiency, and in France this specific form of chlorosis was termed chlorose calcaire. The problem was largely overcome by the selection of lime-resistant American vines as basis for hybrid vines used for rootstock material. However, since such rootstocks may be less than optimal in other respects, {{it is necessary for}} the viticulturalist to balance the need for chlorosis resistance against other viticultural needs. This is illustrated by {{one of the most common}} lime-resistant rootstocks, 41 B, which is a hybrid between V. vinifera cultivar Chasselas and V. berlandieri, which generally has a sufficient, but not extremely high, Phylloxera resistance.|$|R

Árvores com 13 anos de idade localizadas em Colombo - PR, foram submetidas ao corte a 10 cm do solo para indução de brotações, sobre as quais foi realizada a enxertia por garfagem no topo em fenda cheia. Os enxertos foram coletados de sete árvores matrizes com idade de 10 anos e sete árvores com idade acima de 80 anos. Das matrizes selecionadas foram retirados enxertos observando-se a posição apical, mediana e basal dentro da planta matriz. O experimento foi instalado em delineamento inteiramente casualizado com três repetições e 42 tratamentos, no esquema fatorial hierárquico 2 x 7 x 3 (duas idades; 7 matrizes, para cada idade; e 3 posições de coleta). A variável resposta de interesse foi proporção de pegamentos e número e comprimento de brotos. Obteve-se um comportamento diferenciado das matrizes quando amostradas em diferentes posições de coleta. A herdabilidade {{individual}} dos efeitos genotípicos, estimada para o pegamento dos enxertos, foi superior a 74 %, para todos os períodos de avaliação, cujo valor é considerado alto. O coeficiente de variação genética foi da ordem de 34 %, para os períodos de acompanhamento iguais ou superiores a 90 dias, indicando boas perspectivas de ganho no melhoramento do material genético. O coeficiente de variação experimental, nesse mesmo período, ficou entre 78 % e 94 %. Não houve diferenças entre os parâmetros genéticos a partir dos 90 dias.

The experiment was installed with three replications and 42 treatments, in a hierarchical factorial design 2 x 7 x 3 (two ages, seven mother trees for each age and three collection positions). The variables of interest were percentage of survival and number and length of sprouts. A differentiated performance of the mother trees when in different collection positions was observed. The individual heritability of the genotipic effects, estimated for the survival of the grafts, was superior to 74 %, for all the evaluation periods, which is considered very high. The coefficient of genetic variation was 34 %, for the observed periods same or superior to 90 days, indicating good genetic gain perspectives for the improvement of the genetic material. The coefficients of experimental variation, obtained for that same periods were between 78 % and 94 %. It can be observed that there were no differences among the genetic parameters indicating the possibility of evaluation of the survival of the grafts after 90 days. Based on those results it can be concluded that the Ilex paraguariensis topgrafting directly in the field is technically viable; better survival of grafting are obtained for young trees and with apical sprouts; mother trees have shown differentiated responses in respect to survival of grafting...|$|R
40|$|The writers review {{previous}} concepts {{concerning the}} reaction of citrus plants to the tristeza disease. It is recognized that environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and light can influence plant reaction, but these are considered of relatively minor importance. Characteristics of the plant itself govern its reaction to the disease and among those, resistance to infection, ability to permit virus increase and tolerance or non-tolerance of tissues are considered most important. Tests using viruliferous oriental citrus aphids for inoculation of various citrus types budded over sour orange rootstocks (table 1 and 2) showed a correlation between susceptibility to infection and severity of symptoms. The sweet oranges {{proved to be the}} most susceptible to infection and showed severe disease symptoms. The Barão sweet orange appeared to be more susceptible than Valencia. The mandarins tended to show some resistance to infection, but when infected, severe symptoms developed. The tolerant tangelos (7) behaved similarly to sweet oranges : They were very susceptible to infection and showed severe symptoms. The non-tolerant tangelos, susceptible citranges (7) and grapefruits behaved more or less alike, and showed medium susceptibility to infection and moderately severe disease symptoms. Among the grapefruits, Leonardy was. observed to be relatively more susceptible and showed more severe symptoms than Duncan. The pummelos, shaddocks and sour oranges were comparatively very resistant to infection and showed only moderate symptoms when infected. It has been found that the sour oranges can be more easily infected by tissue union than by the aphid vector. Poncirus trifoliata, citrumelos and resistant citranges showed no symptoms and no virus could be recovered from the inoculated plants even after three inoculations. The nature of injury caused by tristeza in the non-tolerant graft and intergraft combinations is discussed. The observation of symptoms shown by plants consisting of a sour orange inter-stem-graft between sweet orange roots and foliage seems to indicate that phloem collapse of the sour intergraft does not entirely prevent food translocation, since under field conditions the sweet stem below the sour intergraft continued, for almost two years, to increase in size at about the same rate as the sweet stem above. The growth of the sour intergraft was observed to be constricted and its lack of developments indicates a possible injurious effect of the disease on tissues other than the phloem. Root tissues of sour oranges {{have been found to be}} sensitive;to injury, sincejsweet orange <b>tops</b> <b>grafted</b> directly onto sour orange roots and subsequently inoculated showed the usual tristeza symptoms. Death of rootlets and roots was found to occur not only in infected plants with tolerant tops and non-tolerant rootstocks but also on infected tolerant plants having an inter-stem-graft of non-tolerant sour orange. These observations and those made of root reaction on mechanically ringed plants indicate that although the root tissues of non-tolerant stocks may be sensitive to injury the rootlet and root symptoms are mostly secondary reactions. Tests carried out showed that the tristeza virus was recovered from insect protected sprouts grown at the ends of severed roots of Caipira sweet orange stock thus indicating that the virus was definitely present in the roots of a tolerant rootstock. Previously tristeza has been recognized as being associated with various citrus stock-scion combinations. In the present paper 50 seedling types have been reported as showing tristeza symptoms following heavy aphid inoculation. The symptoms shown by infected seedlings are similar to those shown by non-tolerant stock-scion combinations. Small sweet orange seedlings have been observed to show some symptoms of tristeza following heavy inoculations, but citrus types possessing tolerant tissues have shown a tendency toward recovery from symptom expression. The writers, on the basis of observed plant responses, have discussed the mode of inheritance of the main characteristis involved in plant reaction to tristeza. Some seedling progenies of known crosses between Poncirus trifoliata and sweet oranges (citranges) have been found to permit virus increase as the sweet orange parent does, whereas others behave like P. trifoliata and apparently do not permit virus multiplication. No relationship has been found between the trifoliata leaf-shape and inability to permit virus increase, since some of the hybrids that possess the trifoliata leaves, permit virus multiplication. Backcrosses of citranges to sweet oranges show a tendency to behave like the sweet orange parent. Hybrids between P. trifoliata and grapefruits (citrumelos) have behaved in most cases as the parent P. trifoliata. This seems to indicate that tolerant tissues and inability to permit virus increase are dependent on dominant factors in this type of cross. Hybrids between Citrus reticulata and C. paradisi (tangelos) do not show a clear-cut type of inheritance. Some tangelos behave Uke the mandarin parent, possessing tolerant tissues; others behave like the grapefruit parent indicating possession of non-tolerant tissues. The inability to permit virus increase is a characteristic of little value in a rootstock improvement since tops of most commercial citrus varieties permit virus multiplication. It is pointed out that improvement of citrus rootstock with respect to tristeza should be aimed at combining tolerant tissues such as found in P. trifoliata or hybrids, C. sinensis, C. reticulata, etc., with other favorable characters such as vigor, resistance to gummosis, etc. Field tests showed that {{the reaction of}} infective buds on different rootstocks varies not only according to the tolerance of non-tolerance of the rootstock tissues, but also according to whether the buds themselves belong to types that possess non-tolerant or tolerant tissues. Infective buds of tolerant types, as sweet oranges, when budded on non-tolerant stocks produce a first flush of growth that is apparently healthy, but which later shows disease symptoms. For a period of about two months from date of budding, there is little or no difference between sprouts from healthy or infective buds of tolerant types. In contrast, when infective buds of non-tolerant types are budded on non-tolerant stocks, disease symptoms appear practically as soon as the buds start to grow. Observations indicate that infective buds from tolerant citrus types when budded on tolerant stocks usually do not develop symptoms even though the plant is a carrier of the virus. On the other hand observations indicate that infective buds of non-tolerant citrus types when budded on tolerant stocks may at times produce some symptoms. A possible explanation for the above-mentioned reactions is presented and is based on the relation between virus movement and food translocation in the plant. In the study of the relationship of tristeza virus to host tissues, plants composed of a sweet top over sour orange rootstock were allowed to develop two sweet orange branches. One branch of each plant was then ringed and inoculated by the vector. The branch not inoculated did not develop symptoms and 16 months after inoculation, buds were taken from the inoculated and the non-inoculated branches and tested for presence of virus. All buds taken from the inoculated ringed branches were found to be carrying the virus, whereas the buds taken from the other branch of the same plant did not have any virus. This experiment shows that the tristeza virus was not able to move across the ringed portion of the stem during that period, thus indicating that the tristeza virus is probably a phloem virus. Results from extensive buddings of various citrus stocks in the field indicate that buds taken from old sweet orange plants that have been known to be infected for a long time have been found to carry the virus in all buds. On the other hand, tests with buds taken from young plants recently infected, of Duncan grapefruit, sour orange and in some cases of Dancy tangerine and Valencia sweet orange, showed that not all buds were carrying the virus. It is not yet known whether buds that are mature prior to infection may temporarily escape virus invasion or whether citrus types which have non-tolerant tissues may limit to a certain extent complete systemic invasion of the tristeza virus...|$|R
