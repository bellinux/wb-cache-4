25|$|When Zeus had pity on Ixion {{and brought}} him to Olympus and {{introduced}} him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, who was later named Nephele, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it and from their union came Centaurus. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity, at first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to Tartarus.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It {{made it possible to}} dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|E
25|$|Song was a {{virtually}} unknown to most South Korea fans before 2001. Song {{had made his}} international debut against Macedonia in June 2000 under Huh Jung-Moo, Hiddink's predecessor, but had not yet developed well. When Guus Hiddink arrived {{to take over the}} reins, he received mass criticism from the Korean public when he chose the inexperienced Song in Korean starting line-up for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, to replace the popular but injured captain Hong Myung Bo for the tournament. Under Guus Hiddink's expert guidance Song developed into a key player <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> one of the first names to go on Hiddink's team sheet during the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The Jeep Liberty, or Jeep Cherokee (KJ/KK) outside North America, is {{a compact}} SUV that was {{produced}} by Jeep for the model years 2002–2012. Introduced {{as a replacement for}} the Cherokee (XJ), the Liberty was priced between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee. It was the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs until the car based 4-door Compass and Patriot arrived for 2007. The Liberty featured unibody-construction. It was assembled at the Toledo North Assembly Plant in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela. The Liberty ceased production on August 16, 2012. The next generation restored the previous nameplate of Jeep Cherokee <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> used outside of North America.|$|E
25|$|When Antony {{attempted}} {{to take control}} of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) by force and displace Decimus Brutus, the Senate led by Cicero called on Lepidus to support Brutus – one of Caesar's killers. Lepidus prevaricated, recommending negotiation with Antony. After Antony's defeat at the Battle of Mutina, the Senate sent word that Lepidus' troops were no longer needed. Antony, however, marched towards Lepidus's province with his remaining forces. Lepidus continued to assure the Senate of his loyalty, but engaged in negotiations with Antony. When the two armies met, large portions of Lepidus's forces joined up with Antony. Lepidus negotiated an agreement with him, while claiming to the Senate that he had no choice. It is unclear whether Lepidus' troops forced him to join with Antony, whether <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> Lepidus's plan, or whether he arranged matters to gauge the situation and make the best deal.|$|E

The Mahavira-charita calls Kabandha's real form Danu, son of Sri. The Bhattikavya does not explicitly name Kabandha. He is introduced as [...] "a dreadful demon <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> hungry and being endowed with long arms". Later, he is identified as Sri's son, who was cursed by an ascetic. The [...] Ramacharitamanas tells that Kabandha was cursed by the sage Durvasa, {{who is known for}} his hot temper in Hindu mythology.|$|E
500|$|... "Buenos Amigos" [...] {{was written}} by Salvadoran {{recording}} artist Álvaro Torres and produced by Enrique Elizondo. After seeing American Tejano pop singer Selena perform at a showcase event, Torres immediately wanted to record a duet with her. He said in Selena Remembered; a documentary about her career, [...] "...she had an attractive way about her <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> present. We got along very well and a friendship developed from that point on. Several months later I wrote a song which I thought {{would be good to}} record a duet with Selena." [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] was recorded for Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991).|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge of}} [...] "Lamb of God" [...] paraphrases {{the chorus of}} [...] "Across the Universe" [...] (from 1970's Let It Be), whose lyric [...] "Nothing's gonna change my world" [...] {{inspired}} the song. Manson elaborated that: [...] "Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> something growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize the media's veneration of death, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. [...] "Burning Flag" [...] is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: [...] "Valentine's Day", [...] "The Fall of Adam", [...] "King Kill 33°" [...] and [...] "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)", as each song abruptly ends and is instantaneously followed by the intro of the proceeding track.|$|E

500|$|Kogen {{commented that}} Lisa and Marge episodes [...] "tend {{to be the}} better episodes", {{because they are more}} {{thought-out}} and have more emotional depth to them. However, they are harder to write than other episodes because they are [...] "less jokey." [...] The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge's role with Homer, who tends to be funnier than Marge. Jean commented that because he has a daughter, Homer–Lisa episodes are easier for him to write and he [...] "always want to work on them." [...] Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct, because [...] "the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> interesting." [...] In one scene, Homer makes Lisa sit {{on the end of the}} sofa so that she will not interrupt the game. Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa, recalls that many people at the table-read thought Homer was [...] "too harsh" [...] in the scene, but it ended up being included in the episode anyway.|$|E
500|$|Critic Bill Wyman {{acknowledges}} that Lydon's [...] "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" [...] were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While {{some of the}} Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not—including what McLaren himself cites as the [...] "pivotal moment that changed everything", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show. [...] "Malcolm milked situations", says Cook, [...] "he didn't instigate them; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> our own doing." [...] It is also hard to ascribe {{the effect of the}} Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren [...] "was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of {{what he was up to}} as he has since made out." [...] By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.|$|E
500|$|Despite Blue Velvets initial {{appearance}} as a mystery, the film operates {{on a number}} of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s film noir, containing and exploring such conventions as the femme fatale (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable villain (Frank Booth), and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark cinematography. Blue Velvet represents and establishes Lynch's famous [...] "askew vision," [...] and introduces several common elements of Lynch's work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world, and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. Perhaps the most significant Lynchian trademark in the film is the depiction of unearthing a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town; Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is [...] "seeing something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> hidden," [...] alluding to the plot's central idea. Lynch's characterization of films, symbols, and motifs have become well-known, and his particular style, characterised largely in Blue Velvet for the first time, has been written about extensively using descriptions like [...] "dreamlike," [...] "ultraweird," [...] "dark," [...] and [...] "oddball." [...] Red curtains also show up in key scenes, specifically in Dorothy's apartment, which have since become a Lynch trademark. The film has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) because of its stark treatment of psychotic evil. The premise of both films is curiosity, leading to an investigation that draws the lead characters into a hidden, voyeuristic underworld of crime.|$|E
