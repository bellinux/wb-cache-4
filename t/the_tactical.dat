5|$|Tactically, the Persian fleet {{should have}} held the {{advantage}} at sea, since the Athenian {{part of the}} Greek fleet was, despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis, still raw in seamanship. However, whether because of their low morale, or {{because they were in}} fact outnumbered, the Persians sought instead <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> advantage of joining up with the army under Tigranes, and fortifying a position. However, when the Greeks chose to fight on land, the Persians then threw away the advantage of their fortifications by emerging to fight the Greeks in the open field. Furthermore, as Marathon and Thermopylae had shown, large numbers conferred little advantage against the more heavily armoured hoplites; thus, as the battle began, it was the Greeks who had <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> upper hand.|$|E
50|$|At {{the peak}} of its {{operations}} in 1968, the unit numbered 35,000 personnel and 600 aircraft. Its major combat units included <b>the</b> 8th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing, <b>the</b> 355th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing, <b>the</b> 388th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing, <b>the</b> 432d <b>Tactical</b> Reconnaissance Wing, <b>the</b> 553d <b>Tactical</b> Reconnaissance Wing, and the 56th Special Operations Wing.|$|R
50|$|The 307th TFS was {{deployed}} from <b>the</b> 31st <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing at Homestead AFB, Florida. <b>The</b> 416th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Squadron was deployed from <b>the</b> 3rd <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing at England AFB Louisiana.

On 8 December 1966 the squadron {{was assigned to}} <b>the</b> 504th <b>Tactical</b> Air Support Group.|$|R
5|$|The {{incident}} led to {{more stringent}} gun control laws in Canada. It also introduced changes in <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> response of police to shootings, changes which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the Dawson College shootings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactical</b> {{decision}} not to bring cannons forward {{was probably one of}} Abercrombie's most significant errors. The use of cannon against the French works would have cleared paths through the abatis and breached the breastworks.|$|E
5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war, Barkley supported bills implementing conscription and raising revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after {{the election of a}} more conservative Congress in 1918.|$|E
50|$|The wing grew in {{strength}} during 1975. <b>The</b> 26th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Squadron received the Northrop T-38 Talon {{for use as}} dissimilar air combat training and was redesignated <b>the</b> 26th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Training Squadron. <b>The</b> 90th <b>Tactical</b> FighterSquadron converted to the F-4E. <b>The</b> 3rd <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Squadron, equipped with the F-4E joined the wing in December, replacing <b>the</b> 68th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Squadron, which had been inactivated earlier. The wing now possessed {{a full complement of}} fighters.|$|R
50|$|Operations at George Air Force Base were reorganized again October 5, 1989. <b>The</b> 37th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Wing and <b>the</b> 35th <b>Tactical</b> Training Wing {{consolidated}} all operations {{under the}} newly redesignated 35th Tactical Fighter Wing.

5|$|Descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. The Iliad, {{possibly}} {{referring to}} Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, the British General Staff {{released}} a training pamphlet titled SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, espousing {{the return to}} the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics {{and the use of}} the platoon as a self-contained tactical unit. The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated hand grenade, rifle grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> change with vigour. The corps instilled <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale model representations of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|In October1977, {{just prior}} to Phase 2 of the XST competition, Lockheed was tasked with {{exploring}} possible operational aircraft. Just a month later, on the day HB1001 was transported to Groom Lake, the Air Force awarded the company a contract under the code name Senior Trend. The Air Force wanted to exploit the revolutionary technologies developed during the Have Blue program. <b>The</b> <b>Tactical</b> Air Command ordered five full-scale development and twenty production aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On 1 October 1962 <b>the</b> 127th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Squadron was {{authorized}} to expand {{to a group}} level, and <b>the</b> 184th <b>Tactical</b> Fighter Group was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated.

5|$|In the engagement, U.S. Marines {{from the}} 7th Marine Regiment and U.S. Army {{soldiers}} from the 164th Infantry Regiment under <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> command of William H. Rupertus and Edmund B. Sebree, attacked a concentration of Japanese Army troops, most of whom belonged to the 230th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Toshinari Shōji. Shōji's troops had marched to the Koli Point area after the failed Japanese assaults on U.S. defenses during the Battle for Henderson Field in late October 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{ground and}} naval forces were {{aided by a}} large aerial fleet of 3470 planes. The {{majority}} of them were stationed on Corsica and Sardinia. <b>The</b> <b>tactical</b> bombers and fighters had to support the landings directly, while the strategic element had to bomb German targets deep into France. The strategic bombing started well before the landing and targeted airports, traffic hubs, railroads, coastal defenses, and communication lines.|$|E
5|$|The German army's rapid {{manoeuvres}} {{during the}} invasion had forced <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing Hungarian army units {{and there was}} no significant fighting between the two armies. The Hungarian forces advanced south to the Danube between Vukovar and the confluence with the Tisza without any real military resistance. Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} a success for the Poles at both <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> level (the battle of Radzymin itself) and the {{strategic}} level (its role {{in the battle of}} Warsaw). After several days of constant fighting for the town of Radzymin and its immediate vicinity, the Russian attack was repelled and the Poles were able to mount a successful counteroffensive, forcing the Russian armies out of Poland and in the end destroying them completely.|$|E
5|$|The first RAF Phantom {{unit was}} 228 Operational Conversion Unit, which was {{stood up in}} August 1968. The Phantom entered {{operational}} service in May 1969, when 6 Squadron was formed at RAF Coningsby in <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> strike role. 54 Squadron was formed in September the same year, followed by 41 Squadron in 1972 as a tactical reconnaissance unit. A further four squadrons were formed under RAF Germany in 1970 and 1971: 2, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons, all at RAF Brüggen. Along with their conventional strike role, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons were assigned a tactical nuclear strike role under SACEUR, using weapons supplied by the United States. After initial work-up, 2 Squadron moved to and operated from RAF Laarbruch in <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> reconnaissance role. The aircraft assigned to the two tactical reconnaissance units were fitted with a pod containing four optical cameras, an infrared linescan and a sideways looking radar.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactical</b> {{approaches}} {{of the two}} sides were cancelling each other out. Real's slow pace interspersed with high speed bursts, while Liverpool preferred a more deliberate approach, keeping possession and making use of their wingers. Their various forms of marking also negated each other, Real man marked Liverpool's best players such as Dalglish and Souness, while Liverpool were content for the nearest defender to mark {{the man on the}} ball.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tactical</b> {{assessment}} {{of both sides}} was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E
5|$|A {{transfer}} to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro career had a slow start, making only one first team appearance in four years. He {{broke into the}} first team in 1954, flourishing as part of <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> system known as the Revie Plan. During this period he played in two consecutive FA Cup finals, as a loser in 1955 and a winner in 1956. After making 283 appearances for Manchester City he joined Wrexham as player-manager in 1961, guiding them to promotion in his first season. Barnes returned to Manchester City in 1970, and over {{more than two decades}} filled a variety of coaching roles, including overseeing the development of the youth team which won the 1986 FA Youth Cup.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in <b>the</b> <b>tactical</b> strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E
