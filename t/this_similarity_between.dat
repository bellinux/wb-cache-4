50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>this</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the spatial and temporal effect could be explained by the natural scene statistics in which spatial and temporal context always share features, since objects are typically smooth and change slowly.

For example, spatial features have a key role in linking signals across space to get boundaries inference, while temporal signals may not play the same role.|$|E

However, <b>this</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> German and Russian is not evidence that German is {{more closely related to}} Russian than to English; it only means that the innovation in question—the loss of the accusative/dative distinction—happened more recently in English than the divergence of English from German. The division of related languages into sub-groups is more certainly accomplished by finding shared linguistic innovations differentiating them the parent language, rather than shared features retained from the parent language.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{that do not}} fit a tree {{perfectly}} are {{not simply}} [...] "noise", they can contain relevant phylogenetic signal {{in some parts of}} a tree, even if they conflict with the tree overall. In the whale example given above, the lack of external testicles in whales is homoplastic: It reflects a return to the condition present in ancient ancestors of mammals, whose testicles were internal. <b>This</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> whales and ancient mammal ancestors is in conflict with the tree we accept, since it implies that the mammals with external testicles should form a group excluding whales. However, among the whales, the reversal to internal testicles actually correctly associates the various types of whales (including dolphins and porpoises) into the group Cetacea. Still, the determination of the best-fitting tree—and thus which data do not fit the tree—is a complex process. Maximum parsimony is one method developed to do this.|$|E
5000|$|The {{success of}} the drug therapy of the virus and Parkinson’s {{diseases}} using abiotic polyhedral adamantane molecules suggests the pharmaceutical potential of other xenobiotics with rigid three-dimensional molecular structure.

50|$|Succinylcholine has a 10-atom {{distance}} between its N atoms, like decamethonium. Yet {{it has been}} reported that it takes two molecules, as with acetylcholine, to open one nicotinic ion channel. The conformational explanation for this is that each acetylcholine moiety of succinylcholine prefers the gauche (bent, cis) state. The attraction between the N and O atoms is greater than the onium head repulsion. In this most populated state, the N-N distance is shorter than the optimal distance of ten carbon atoms and too short to occupy both receptive sites. <b>This</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> succinyl- and acetyl-choline also explains its acetylcholine-like side-effects.Comparing molecular lengths, the pachycurares dimethyltubocurarine and d-tubocurarine both are very rigid and measure close to 1.8 nm in total length. Pancuronium and vecuronium measure 1.9 nm, whereas pipecuronium is 2.1 nm. The potency of these compounds follows the same rank of order as their length. Likewise, the leptocurares prefer a similar length. Decamethonium, which measures 2 nm, is the most potent in its category, whereas C11 is slightly too long. Gallamine despite having low bulk and rigidity is the most potent in its class, and it measures 1.9 nm. Based on this information one can conclude that the optimum length for neuromuscular blocking agents, depolarizing or not, should be 2 to 2.1 nm.|$|E
50|$|For {{different}} reasons, often including abnormally {{low scores}} {{in a particular}} set of indicators, a few Western countries which perform reasonably high in other freedom indices rank rather low at the WIMF. Hungary and Norway fail to make it into the “high moral freedom” area, although just for under half a point. The British and Irish performance is particularly low within the moral freedom area. Iceland, Japan, Poland and Romania barely manage to pass the fifty point mark, while Singapore, Israel or South Korea fall in the “insufficient moral freedom” part of the index. While most countries topping the WIMF in its first edition belong to the developed world, some countries with a lesser degree of development have also made their way into the higher classification areas. Cambodia, scoring just over seventy points, obtains the fifteenth place in the global classification and is the first developing country in the index. It is also worth noting that the four European micro-states considered −the principalities of Andorra and Monaco and the republics of San Marino and Malta− score surprisingly low in comparison with their bigger neighbours. In spite of their high living standards and economic freedom, these countries fail to perform similarly when it comes to moral freedom. A similar situation is observed in Caribbean and South Pacific island micro-states, which score poorly in most categories and rank in the lower areas of the WIMF classification. <b>This</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> very small countries in different regions, in spite of the cultural influence of their neighbours and allies, may lead to the conclusion that moral freedom is affected, among other relevant factors, by country size.|$|E

30|$|We {{note that}} {{surprisingly}} the two quantities cosγ and ξ _Rm {{are very similar}} (Table  5). Our synthetic tests of these quantities clearly {{show that there is}} no apparent reason for this similarity (Table  2). This suggests that the particular field–flow interactions in the dynamo models produce same field–flow alignment (represented by cosγ) and advection/stretching interference (represented by ξ _Rm). The intermediate cosγ values arise from low contributions at high latitudes where the flow is nearly aligned with the radial field, balanced by large contributions at low latitudes where the flow is nearly perpendicular to the radial field (Finlay and Amit 2011). The intermediate ξ _Rm values stem from the nearly non-correlated advection and stretching SV patterns. Indeed, for RMS ratio St/Ad ∼ 0.5 – 1 the purely non-correlated relation gives ∼ 0.7 – 0.75, while some overlap introduces some anti-correlation with lower ξ _Rm contributions (see expressions after 21). At the moment, however, the precise reason for <b>this</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> cosγ and ξ _Rm in the dynamo models is still unknown to us.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for human action {{recognition}} based on a string kernel framework.

The main advantage of the proposed approach lies in its ability to effectively deal with actions of different lengths or different temporal scales as well as with noise introduced during the features extraction step.

In order to model <b>this</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> paintings, we should extract the appropriate visual features for paintings and find out the best approach to learn the similarity metric based on these features. We investigate a comprehensive list of visual features and metric learning approaches to learn an optimized similarity measure between paintings.
