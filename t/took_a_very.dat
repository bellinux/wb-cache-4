5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} narrow {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the narrow view. Haworth (1831) using a narrow view treated many species as separate genera, as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related genera such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen genera to six. Herbert, treating the Amaryllidacea as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six genera being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow circumscription of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's genera into the genus Narcissus, but as separate subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|E

5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E

25|$|One of Mulroney's main {{priorities}} was {{to lower}} the deficit, which had increased from $1 billion under Lester B. Pearson to $32.4 billion under Pierre Eliott Trudeau. However, the country's debt increased during Mulroney's term from $32.4 billion to $39 billion. His attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises. Also impeding his progress was the Senate, where the Liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power.

25|$|There were brief {{hopes of}} a return to glory in the 1963–64 season, when a {{remarkable}} 8–2 away win over West Ham United in east London on Boxing Day took them {{to the top of the}} league.

They were again relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division.|$|E
25|$|Thus England, who had {{expected}} to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> quick wicket, that of Andrew Strauss, who was dismissed again by Shane Warne, caught bat-and-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's Ashes bowling record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play due to inadequate light. One additional session of play was however subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there were}} hopes that post-occupation Iran {{could become a}} {{constitutional}} monarchy. The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hands-off role in government, and allowed parliament to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw {{the rise and fall}} of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran—a legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.|$|E
25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were many calls for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the women themselves, or perhaps because of fear that officials would take to stealing the wives of other men. One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E
25|$|The Black Hawks began {{play in the}} 1926–27 season, {{along with}} new {{expansion}} franchises Detroit Cougars and New York Rangers.

Several of them, including Doc Romnes, Taffy Abel, Alex Levinsky, Mike Karakas and Cully Dahlstrom, become staples with the club, and under McLaughlin, the Black Hawks were the first NHL team with an all-American-born lineup.|$|E

25|$|From its {{earliest}} days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During {{most of the}} 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies, to Lima, Peru and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long time to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among porteños towards the Spanish authorities.|$|E
25|$|The horrea of Rome and its port, Ostia, stood two or {{more stories}} high. They were built with ramps, rather than staircases, to provide {{easy access to the}} upper floors. Grain horrea had their ground floor raised on pillars to reduce the {{likelihood}} of damp getting in and spoiling the goods. Many horrea appear to have served as great trading areas with rows of small shops (tabernae) off a central courtyard; some may have been fairly elaborate, perhaps serving as the equivalent of modern shopping arcades. Others, such as those in Ostia, dispensed with the courtyard and instead had rows of tabernae standing back-to-back. In the Middle East, horrea <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different design with a single row of very deep tabernae, all opening onto the same side; this reflected an architectural style that was widely followed in the region's palaces and temple complexes, well before the arrival of the Romans.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the Māori, after {{a series}} of defeats in battles in Auckland and the Waikato, were forced to retreat into {{what became known as the}} King Country, south of the Puniu River near Te Awamutu. The {{government}} then switched its attention to the Bay of Plenty. It was here, in the Tauranga Campaign, that Cameron made his only tactical blunder of the New Zealand Wars when he authorised the attack on Gate Pā and suffered very heavy losses. Cameron possibly overestimated the effectiveness of the heavy bombardment of the pā and anticipated little resistance from the defenders. As the Tauranga Campaign wound down, fighting flared up again in Taranaki. Cameron saw this conflict as completely unnecessary, being wholly provoked by the rapacious confiscation of Māori land. Although he could not refuse orders to commit the British troops, he conducted the campaign at a snail's pace and eventually stopped advancing altogether. By now relations between Cameron and Grey were very frosty. Cameron wrote to the Colonial Office and recommended that all British troops should be withdrawn from New Zealand. At the same time, he submitted his resignation as commander of the troops. Although the British troops were not immediately withdrawn from New Zealand, they <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> minor role in the subsequent conflicts.|$|E
