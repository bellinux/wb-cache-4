25|$|During the 2004 election, several {{high-profile}} conservative writers {{endorsed the}} Presidential campaign of John Kerry, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> was pursuing policies which {{were anything but}} conservative.

25|$|On February 12, 2006 Deutsche Welle {{reported}} that German authorities were negotiating Kurnaz's repatriation. The German magazine Focus reported in 2006 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> {{was trying to}} tie the release of Kurnaz to Germany's agreeing to accept four other Guantanamo detainees. The USA had cleared approximately 120 detainees for release or transfer. But many could not be returned to their countries of origin. The German and American governments denied that Kurnaz's release had been tied to Germany accepting other detainees. Focus {{reported that}} the German government has agreed to accept one other detainee, not four.

25|$|The {{amount of}} {{ordnance}} dropped on Iraqi positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 {{was less than}} in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration. This information {{has been used to}} attempt to refute the theory <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> had already decided to go to war against Iraq before coming to office and that the bombing during 2001 and 2002 was laying the groundwork for the eventual invasion in 2003. However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq {{in the second half of}} 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6tons in September – before Congress' 11 October authorization of the invasion.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{related to}} the {{technical}} details {{of the collapse of}} the buildings of the World Trade Center have been debated for years, including rebuttals and ridicule. Controlled demolition conspiracy theories were first suggested in October 2001. Eric Hufschmid's book, Painful Questions: An Analysis of the September 11th Attack, in which the controlled demolition theory is explicitly advocated, was published in September 2002. David Ray Griffin and Steven E. Jones are the two most prominent advocates of the theory. Griffin's book The New Pearl Harbor, published in 2004, has become a reference work for the 9/11 Truth movement. In the same year, Griffin published the book The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions, in which he argues that flaws in the commission's report amounts to a cover-up by government officials and says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> was complicit in the 9/11 attacks. Griffin theorized in a June 2010 article that those in the alleged false flag operation wanted the buildings to fall straight down. If they had toppled over, they would have destroyed dozens of other buildings and killed tens of thousands of people.|$|E
25|$|These {{four men}} and other high-value CIA detainees were not {{transferred}} again to military custody at Guantanamo until September 2006.

25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' on-air success {{continued}} in 1990, and World News Tonight consistently led the ratings race. In January, he anchored {{the first installment}} of Peter Jennings Reporting—hour-long, prime-time ABC News specials dedicated to exploring a single topic. His inaugural program on gun violence in America drew praise. His second installment of Peter Jennings Reporting in April, [...] "From the Killing Fields", focused on U.S. policy towards Cambodia. The program alleged {{that the federal government}} was covertly supporting the Khmer Rouge's return to power in the Asian nation, a charge <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> initially denied. On July 18, though, the White House announced that it was ending recognition of the Khmer Rouge.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{had voted}} against {{authorization}} for the Gulf War in 1991, siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; {{he said the}} U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition. [...] Biden was {{a strong supporter of}} the 2001 war in Afghanistan, saying [...] "Whatever it takes, we should do it." [...] Regarding Iraq, Biden stated in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security, {{and that there was no}} option but to eliminate that threat. In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, justifying the Iraq War. [...] While he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a [...] "mistake", he did not push to require a U.S. withdrawal. [...] He supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> should [...] "level with the American people" [...] about the cost and length of the conflict.|$|E
50|$|Along with Iraq's alleged {{development}} of WMDs, another justification for invasion was the purported link between Saddam Hussein's government and terrorist organizations, in particular Al-Qaeda. In <b>that</b> sense, <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> cast <b>the</b> Iraq war {{as part of}} the broader War on Terrorism. As with <b>the</b> argument <b>that</b> Iraq was developing biological and nuclear weapons, evidence linking Hussein and Al-Qaeda was discredited by multiple U.S. intelligence agencies soon after the invasion of Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The Bush-Blair 2003 Iraq memo or Manning memo is {{a secret}} memo of a two-hour meeting between American President George W.

Paulson scoffed at this idea, particularly Kashkari's speculation that Barack Obama, then a candidate in that year's presidential election, would win the presidency and use the crisis to ride to popularity just as former President Ronald Reagan had following the Iran hostage crisis.|$|R
500|$|Barr {{received}} some media exposure {{a few days}} after his nomination by visiting New York City to appear on both the Colbert Report and on Glenn Beck's Headline News program for an hour-long interview. The former appearance was part of the campaign's strategy to inform young voters and former Ron Paul supporters about the campaign. During the interview with Colbert, Barr was asked why he [...] "voted for the PATRIOT Act" [...] if he was such a [...] "big advocate of personal privacy." [...] He responded by saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> [...] "went back on everything they told us [...] they would do with the PATRIOT Act." [...] In early June, the campaign dealt with the issue of racism when a white supremacist group posted a Barr endorsement on Stormfront.org, urging whites to vote for the [...] "best man" [...] rather than the [...] "liberal" [...] John McCain. The Barr campaign repudiated this endorsement. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated, [...] "We do not want and will not accept the support of haters. Tell the haters I said don't let the door hit you in the backside on the way out." [...] He emphasized that [...] "anyone with love in their heart for our country and for every resident of our country regardless of race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation is welcome with open arms." ...|$|E
