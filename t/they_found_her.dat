5|$|The Italians {{took control}} of the wreck, but <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> a total loss, and so began to {{dismantle}} Dunkerque. As part of this process, the ship was deliberately damaged to prevent the French from being able to repair her if she was recaptured; the Italians cut down the main battery guns to render them unusable. The partially scrapped hulk was in turn seized by the Germans when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943. In 1944, the Germans removed the ship's bow to float her out of the drydock to free up the dock and continue the scrapping process. While in Axis possession, she was bombed several times by Allied aircraft. The hulk was condemned on 15 September 1955 and renamed Q56. Her remains, which amounted to not more than , were sold for final demolition on 30 September 1958 for 226,117,000 francs.|$|E
25|$|When {{they arrived}} there, shortly before 11 a.m., they entered {{and called for}} Hedgepeth, who did not respond. In her bedroom, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> bloodied body, wrapped in a quilt, {{partially}} nude. They immediately dialed 9-1-1 and informed police.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, the Shelbourne Hotel {{was bought}} by a Polish group; in a storeroom, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> trunk, {{containing}} her clothes, papers, and SOE issue dagger. This dagger, her medals, {{and some of her}} papers are now held in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum at 20 Prince's Gate, Kensington, London.|$|E
60|$|The {{examination}} was brief, and two words, laconically spoken, sufficed for an explanation--apoplexy, alcohol. The prostrate, quivering {{woman was}} left where <b>they</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{the banquet}} table that evening they related {{the manner in}} which they had {{discovered}} Nimmie Amee, and told how <b>they</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her</b> happily married to Chopfyt, whose relationship to Nick Chopper and Captain Fyter was so bewildering that they asked Ozma's advice what to do about it.|$|R
60|$|Thus these craven spirits {{combined}} to delude and deceive the helpless woman of whom {{half an hour}} before they had stood in such abject terror. If <b>they</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her</b> in hysterics <b>they</b> would have pitied and respected her; but her good sense, her amiability, and noble self-control subjected her to their shameless mockery.|$|R
25|$|The {{night before}} her disappearance, Grinstead visited a beauty pageant (she was active {{as a coach}} to young beauty contestants) and {{attended}} a barbecue. On October 24, 2005, a Monday morning, she {{did not show up}} for work. Co-workers called police, who went to the home where she lived alone. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> cell phone inside the house. Her car was outside, unlocked. Her purse and keys were gone.|$|E
25|$|Once she {{had been}} arrested, the teams in Simi Valley began searching her home and car. In her house <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> journal from the mid-1980s, with {{numerous}} mentions of her love for Ruetten and despondence over his engagement to Rasmussen (and no mentions of her gun having been stolen). Her computer showed that she had searched the Internet for Ruetten's name on several occasions in the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|While she did {{not show}} up at her job or classes she took at nearby George Mason University, her absence was not noted for another three weeks, since {{messages}} to her friends purportedly from her continued to be posted on her Facebook account. After her family noted her absence otherwise, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> car parked near her apartment. Apart from the Facebook posts, there had been no other evidence she had done anything since the day she was last seen. They reported her missing to Loudoun County police.|$|E
50|$|Louise (Jaki Walker): {{a friend}} of Nikki and, later, the whole gang, {{although}} <b>they</b> all <b>found</b> <b>her</b> annoying and try to avoid her most of the time. Nikki hung out with her every time Sasha neglected her for Rob. Louise was {{always looking for a}} lost cause to fight for, and the gang made fun of her for it.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, another tragic event hit the valley. During a Boy Scout camp {{at an old}} farm, a 12-year-old girl disappeared. The {{girl was}} {{from the town of}} Troms√∏ in Northern Norway. The event was widely covered in Norwegian press. Crews searched for her for two years, but all <b>they</b> <b>found</b> was <b>her</b> {{backpack}} lying alongside the Ranelva river.|$|R
50|$|After {{being removed}} from the tank, Lam's body {{was taken to the}} county coroner's office for an autopsy. Two pathologists, Jason Tovar and Yulai Wang, spent four hours that {{afternoon}} dissecting it and examining her internal organs. On February 21, the coroner's office reported that <b>they</b> had <b>found</b> <b>her</b> death to be an accidental drowning, with bipolar disorder as a significant factor.|$|R
25|$|On January 1, 2003, {{family members}} of 19-year-old Nikia Kilpatrick went to check on her. They had not had any news from her for several days. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> body in the bedroom of her apartment. She had been raped then killed by {{strangulation}} with a cord two days before. Her two sons, an eleven-month-old and a two-year-old, were alive but malnourished. Kilpatrick was approximately six months pregnant {{at the time of}} her death. Eight days later, 20-year-old nurse assistant Shawanda Denise McCalister, who was also pregnant {{at the time of her}} death, was raped and strangled in her Jacksonville apartment. The murder scene was almost identical to that of Kilpatrick. She was killed on Durousseau's first day of driving a cab for Gator City Taxi. Her body was found the following day.|$|E
25|$|As a {{small child}} she was {{considered}} delicate and for her health spent {{much time in the}} country. She travelled with her mother and other family to Italy, where she made an agonizing recovery from an illness caused by worms that nearly ended her life. After returning with her mother to England, she rejoined a lively menage of children who lived at Devonshire House and Roehampton, including her cousins: Lord Hartington (later the 6th Duke of Devonshire), Lady Georgiana, and Lady Harriet Cavendish; and two children of Lady Elizabeth Foster and the Duke of Devonshire. With these children she was educated at Devonshire House, at a Dame School in Knightsbridge, and at her overindulgent mother's and grandmother Lady Spencer's knees, although <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> behaviour increasingly troublesome, and experimented with sedatives like laudanum and a special governess to control her. During childhood she became particularly close to Lady Harriet Cavendish, who was only three months older.|$|E

Suspecting witchcraft, she {{questioned}} Lloyd, and <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{in the company of}} another. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> [...] "in <b>her</b> secret parts two teats hanging nigh together like unto a piece of flesh that a child had sucked. And that each of the teat was about an inch in length." ...|$|R
500|$|The defence {{disputed the}} {{location}} of Sheila's body. The police said <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> upstairs with her mother. According to early police logs, PC Laurence Collins initially reported seeing through a window {{what he thought was}} the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was in fact a man. A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs.|$|E
500|$|The defense, led by {{attorneys}} Martha Hickman and James Patrick Quinn, {{focused on}} the circumstantial quality of the prosecution's evidence, noting that prior police investigation had determined James Kinne's death to be [...] "obviously accidental" [...] and that the jury was obligated to assume innocence on the defendant's part no matter how unpleasant <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> moral character to be. The defense, too, attacked the reliability of John Boldizs's testimony, calling him a [...] "poor, mixed-up kid" [...] who would [...] "sign anything". Kinne's attorneys also presented testimony from witnesses supporting {{the viability of the}} theory that Danna Kinne had shot her father, including statements that guns had been regularly left within Danna's reach at the family home, that Danna was able to pull the triggers on toy guns with stiffer trigger pulls than the weapon that caused Kinne's death, and that Danna had often been observed pretending to fire guns in play.|$|E
500|$|One {{character}} who {{was cut from}} the pilot episode was an unpleasant, racist, wheelchair-bound old woman named Mrs. Littlefield, supposedly a regular customer of Cheers, who {{was intended to be}} a recurring character. Her lines were filmed as part of a rough cut of the pilot. However, the producers decided to cut the character out of the episode, as <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> character did not mesh with other characters or with the overall tone of the show. Nevertheless, the uncredited actress who played her can still be seen as a background performer in a few scenes. [...] Some sources credit this actress as Elaine Strich, although the unidentified actress who is still seen on camera looks nothing like Stritch. In answer to a question about the actress, Cheers writer/producer Ken Levine has stated on his blog [...] "that was not Elaine Stritch" [...] The producers ultimately decided to eliminate Mrs. Littlefield completely from the show from that point forward, necessitating changes to some yet-to-be-filmed scripts for the first few episodes.|$|E

50|$|Malak's {{brothers}} and husband murdered a man <b>they</b> <b>found</b> in <b>her</b> house, and to escape criminal {{responsibility for the}} murder, the men accused Malak of {{having an affair with}} the victim.

500|$|Willette Kershaw, an American {{actress who}} was staging banned plays in Paris, {{proposed}} a dramatisation of The Well of Loneliness. Hall accepted a ¬£100 advance, {{but when she}} and Troubridge saw Kershaw act, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> too feminine {{for the role of}} Stephen. Hall tried to void the contract on a technicality, but Kershaw refused to change her plans. The play opened on 2 September 1930. No playwright was credited, implying that Hall had written the adaptation herself; it was actually written by one of Kershaw's ex-husbands, who reworked the story to make it more upbeat. According to Janet Flanner, who reported on the opening night for The New Yorker, Kershaw [...] "made up in costume what she lacked in psychology", with designer boots, breeches and riding crop. Then she changed into a white dress for a final speech in which she [...] "begged humanity, 'already used to earthquakes and murderers', to try to put up with a minor calamity like the play's and the book's Lesbian protagonist, Stephen Gordon". Hall threatened a lawsuit to stop the production, but the issue soon became moot, since the play closed after only a few nights. The public skirmish between Hall and Kershaw increased sales of the novel.|$|E
500|$|Writer David Gerrold, {{who worked}} with the staff of The Original Series {{following}} {{his work on the}} episode [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", described Chapel as being one of a second-tier set of characters including Uhura, Scotty and Sulu, who were not given as much exposure during the series as the main characters of Kirk, Spock and McCoy. He explained that {{she was the only one}} of the second level of characters whose motivations were explored, however, her primary focus on board the ship was simply to be in love with Spock. Gerrold explained that there was a need to demonstrate the [...] "aloofness" [...] of the Vulcan character, and so this resulted in a character whose love of him needed to be rebuffed, thus giving Chapel her purpose. He suggested that this caused Chapel to be disliked the fandom because [...] "Female fans saw her as a threat to their own fantasies and male fans saw her as a threat to Spock's Vulcan stoicism." [...] But added that those fans were surprised when they met Barrett at science fiction conventions, as <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> likable in person. By the time of the 2009 film Star Trek, the character had become more popular among fans, who were asking if she would appear in the new films.|$|E
