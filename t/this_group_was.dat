5|$|Helena {{was devoted}} to nursing, and took the lead at the {{charitable}} organisations she represented. She was also an active campaigner, and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration. Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society interest that surrounded organisations such as the Royal British Nurses' Association. The RBNA still survives today with Baroness Cox as president. Emily Williamson founded the Gentlewomen's Employment Association in Manchester; one of the projects which came out of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> the Princess Christian Training College for Nurses, in Fallowfield, Manchester.|$|E

50|$|The Golden Beach Group lies unconformably {{above the}} Strzelecki <b>Group,</b> and <b>was</b> {{deposited}} in the late Cretaceous. The lithology of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> shale, and sandstone. In addition to these major lithologic <b>groups,</b> there <b>are</b> also volcanic flows of andesitic-basaltic composition present. The depositional environments represented by <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>are</b> deep water lakes, and floodplains. The Kipper Shale Formation within <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> a 1,0000 m thick lacustrine shale. Though this would typically make a good source rock, {{it is believed that}} oxidation of organic matter inhibited the generation of hydrocarbons.|$|R
5|$|On 8 February 1942, Albert Speer {{became the}} Reichsminister for Armaments and Munitions and gained {{influence}} over the Navy's construction programs. Speer reassigned {{some members of the}} H class design staff to work on new U-boats and other tasks deemed critical to the war effort. The Schiffsneubaukommission (New Ships Construction Commission), intended to liaise with Speer and the OKM, was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the design work that resulted in the H-42 type, as well as the subsequent designs. The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H-41 type and played no further role in battleship development.|$|E
5|$|The Sauks {{were divided}} {{about whether to}} resist {{implementation}} of the disputed 1804 treaty. Most Sauks decided to relocate west of the Mississippi rather than become involved in a confrontation with the United States. The leader of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> Keokuk, who had helped defend Saukenuk against the Americans during the War of 1812. Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often spoke {{on behalf of the}} Sauk civil chiefs in negotiations with the Americans. Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities on the east coast in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.|$|E

These groups are {{typically}} led by a dominant female and male, who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> chosen because of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years. During series three, Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog.|$|E

5|$|The six-boat {{group that}} {{included}} UB-43 and UB-47 was ordered in July 1915, and both boats {{had been laid}} down in early September. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> selected by the German Admiralstab for deployment to the Mediterranean, but, unlike the smaller UB I boats, they could not as easily be transported overland by rail. Weser prepared the boats for rail shipment by cutting the boat sections longitudinally, and sent all the materials, along with German shipyard workers, to Pola, where the boats were reassembled. UB-43 was launched in early April 1916, while UB-47 followed in June.|$|E
5|$|The stage {{began with}} an 18-rider {{breakaway}} within the first five minutes of racing. This included Contador's teammate Robert Kišerlovski and <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> joined shortly afterwards by several more riders, including Yuri Trofimov, another Tinkoff rider, while others were dropped {{and returned to the}} peloton. Thomas De Gendt and Antoine Duchesne were again in the breakaway; Duchesne won the first four climbs of the day, with De Gendt second on each occasion. Duchesne won enough points to secure victory in the mountains classification.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{groups of}} farmers and fishermen, {{a total of}} 325 individuals, banded {{together}} in the Kampoeng Rawa Association on 4 August 2012. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> tasked with managing the new tourist site, which opened, despite construction being incomplete, shortly before Eid al-Fitr (18–19 August). The site was quickly popular, receiving an average of 2,000 visitors a day during the Eid holidays, and became a common location for events held by the local government. In late August 2012, the cost of entry was Rp. 2,500 per person, with an additional parking fee of Rp. 5,000 per car, although various activities were extra. During the four-day Eid al-Fitr holiday in 2013, the attraction received over 14,000 visitors.|$|E

5|$|While {{the overall}} {{population}} {{growth of the}} city has varied, {{there has been a}} steady growth in the number and percentage of non-white residents. The only decline in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> between 1960 and 1970, when the city's overall population declined markedly. In the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of the city was 61.55% African American, 35.71% White, 0.9% Asian, 0.2% Native American, <0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.59% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.75% of the population.|$|E
5|$|After the Crown {{the most}} {{important}} government institution was the Privy Council, composed of the king's closest advisers, but which, unlike in England, retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by Parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent. The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late 15th century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were some of the great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy, the most successful of which moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, {{towards the end of the}} period, archbishops. By the end of the 15th century <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards the clerically-dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 50percent of midshipmen {{were the}} sons of {{professional}} men, which included {{the sons of}} naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail, such as the Saumarez, Hood, and Parker families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group, about 27percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, {{and they had a}} considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785. The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.|$|E

5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, one of which {{included}} the first complete performance of {{the final version of}} his First Symphony and another the premiere of the revised version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony. Before this visit he had spent much time keeping in touch with Rimsky-Korsakov and those around him. Rimsky-Korsakov, along with Alexander Glazunov, Anatol Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the Belyayev circle. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he spent much time in the company of these men, and his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.|$|E
5|$|In late December 1696 the Chak'an Itza {{attacked}} the large Kejache mission town of Pak'ek'em; they abducted {{almost all the}} inhabitants and burned the church. The demoralised Spanish garrison at Chuntuki buried their weapons and ammunition and retreated five leagues (approximately 13miles or 21km) back towards Campeche. From late December 1696 {{to the middle of}} January 1697 Ursúa sent parties of soldiers and workmen along the road towards the lake; the first group was commanded by Pedro de Zubiaur and had instructions to begin building a galeota, a large oar-powered warship. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> followed by reinforcements bringing supplies, including light and heavy weapons, gunpowder and food. On 23 January Ursúa left Campeche with more soldiers and muleteers, bringing the total number of soldiers arriving as reinforcements to 130. The Spanish fortified their positions at Ch'ich' and deployed heavy artillery for its defence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778, George Washington ordered Major Benjamin Tallmadge to form the Culper Ring. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} of a select few trustworthy individuals whose purpose was to collect information about the British movements and activities in New York City. The Ring is famous for uncovering Benedict Arnold's intentions of treason, which shocked Washington because Arnold was someone who had {{contributed significantly to the}} war effort. Arnold was embittered by his dealings with Congress over rank and finances, as well as the alliance with France, so he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post that he commanded at West Point. Washington just missed apprehending him, but did capture his co-conspirator Major John André, a British intelligence officer under Clinton who was hanged by order of a court-martial called by Washington.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones {{to attend}} a {{convention}} alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded {{as a condition of}} union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} of these migrations to arrive in the Valley of Mexico settled on an island in the Lake Texcoco and {{proceeded}} to subjugate the surrounding tribes. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> the Mexica, who {{over the course of the}} next three centuries founded an empire named Tenochtitlan. Their political and linguistic influence came to extend into Central America and Nahuatl became a lingua franca among merchants and elites in Mesoamerica, e.g., among the Maya K'iche' people. As Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest urban center in Central America, it attracted speakers of Nahuatl from diverse areas giving birth to an urban form of Nahuatl with traits from many dialects. This urbanized variety of Tenochtitlan is what came to be known as Classical Nahuatl as documented in colonial times.|$|E
