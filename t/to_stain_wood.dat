50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> <b>wood</b> {{in various}} colours, {{according}} to any suitable design, leaving, if desired, {{parts of the}} wood unstained, so as to obtain an imitation of inlay, I proceed as follows: I first apply a varnish or solution which will fill the pores of the wood, and exclude the staining liquid from such parts of the surface as are to remain unstained, then when the varnish or solution is dry, I apply over the whole surface the lightest stain I intend to use; this stain being dry I again apply the varnish, or stopping, coating with it such parts of the surface as I desire to retain of a colour corresponding to the lightest stain, and so I proceed until the desired effect is obtained, the last stain applied being usually black or a very dark stain. The surface having been cleared off may, if desired, be varnished or polished all over, or it may remain as it is left by the last staining process.|$|E

50|$|A simple wooden base adds {{an element}} of {{protection}} to the model because the model itself {{does not need to}} be handled, it can be moved by handling the base. Bases may also hold a plate with some information about the model, such as its title or designation, or some historical background. This kind of bases typically consist of a frame of wood or other material. Finishes on bases range from painted plastic <b>to</b> <b>stained</b> <b>wood</b> <b>to</b> simple landscaping. The disadvantage is that the base adds expense and time to the project.|$|R
50|$|In {{certain cases}} {{you need to}} clean the wood or remove {{existing}} <b>stains</b> prior <b>to</b> <b>staining</b> the <b>wood</b> with a commercial <b>stain</b> in order <b>to</b> avoid damaging the wood. This can be the case for both unfinished and finished wood.|$|R
50|$|As {{it is an}} {{alternative}} to CCA, ACQ {{can be used for}} wood with low to extremely high exposure to the elements and weathering. The concentrations used increase with the corresponding expected levels of exposure of the timber. The treatment lends a distinctive green tint to the timber, although pigment can be introduced during the treatment process <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the <b>wood</b> in shades of brown and green. ACQ-treated timber can be painted, but this is not necessary.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Tru-Scale made milled wood roadbed sections, {{simulating}} ballast, tie plates and milled ties with a gauged, grooved slot with simulated tie plates. Bulk HO code 100 rail was spiked {{in place with}} HO spikes. This was available in straight lengths and curves, from 18-inch radius to 36-inch radius. It {{was up to the}} user <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the <b>wood</b> for the tie colors prior to laying the brass track, and then adding scale ballast between the ties.|$|R
50|$|Because it is {{compatible}} with most other finishes, shellac is also used as a barrier or primer coat on wood to prevent the bleeding of resin or pigments into the final finish, or <b>to</b> prevent <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> from blotching.|$|R
50|$|In furniture-making, ammonia {{solution}} was traditionally used <b>to</b> darken or <b>stain</b> <b>wood</b> containing tannic acid. After being sealed inside a container with the wood, fumes from the solution react with the tannic acid and iron salts naturally found in wood, creating a rich, dark <b>stained</b> look <b>to</b> the <b>wood.</b> This was commonly {{used during the}} arts and crafts movement in furniture- a furniture style which was primarily constructed of oak and stained using these methods.|$|R
40|$|Jahnula purpurea J. Fourn., Raja & Shearer, a {{new species}} in the Jahnulales (Dothideomycetes) {{collected}} from submerged wood in a freshwater river in Martinique Island, Lesser Antilles, is described and illustrated. The characteristic features of the new species are: globose to subglobose, brownish black ascomata with broad, golden brown, subtending hyphae which <b>stain</b> the underlying <b>wood</b> purple; a peridial wall composed of large pseudoparenchymatic cells, which are textura angularis to prismatica in surface view; sparsely septate pseudoparaphyses embedded in a gel matrix; clavate to obclavate asci with a short pedicel; brown, one-septate, ellipsoidal, rough-walled ascospores without a gelatinous sheath or appendages. Unfortunately, because limited material was available from the type collection, {{we were unable to}} obtain molecular data. Jahnula purpurea is distinct from all previously described species of Jahnula in its ability <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the <b>wood</b> purple and in a combination of ascomal, ascus, and ascospore size and morphology...|$|R
30|$|Although {{numerous}} fungus {{species have}} been researched for decorative <b>wood</b> <b>staining</b> (Robinson SC: Developing fungal pigments for 'painting' vascular plants. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2012), development of Chlorociboria sp. staining under controlled conditions has encountered several large hurdles. The native North American Chlorociboria sp. appear to preferentially grow on heavily decayed wood (Johnston & Park 2005), and grow very slowly both on prepared laboratory media, and in mono and dual culture jar systems (Robinson & Laks 2010 a). Chlorociboria sp. also appears <b>to</b> preferentially <b>stain</b> some <b>wood</b> species over others, with Populus sp. and Acer saccharum Marsh. showing significantly more xylindein staining than Betula sp. or Tilia americana L. (Robinson & Laks 2010 a).|$|R
40|$|A {{survey to}} {{identify}} ophiostomatoid fungi that infect wounds on native Norwegian and Swedish broadleaved trees was undertaken during summer 2004. A fungus resembling {{a species of}} Sporendocladia was commonly isolated from the exposed cambium and inner bark of wounds. Morphological examination and comparisons of DNA sequence data for the ITS and 5. 8 S regions of the rRNA gene region led to its identification as Sporendocladia bactrospora. Pathogenicity trials on young Populus tremula and Betula pubescens trees showed that S. bactrospora is capable of causing lesions on these trees. There have been few previous reports of S. bactrospora, and in most cases, these have been as saprophytes on wood. In contrast, {{results of this study}} show that it is a common inhabitant of freshly made wounds on native broadleaved trees in Scandinavia, and it appears <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>staining</b> of <b>wood.</b> Norwegian Research Council (152266 /V 10) [URL]...|$|R

30|$|Wood {{specimens}} {{tested for}} adhesive bond strength were examined after failure using fluorescence microscopy to quantify penetration {{depth of the}} adhesive into the wood structure. Specimens measuring 5 [*]×[*] 20 mm 2 were cut {{from the middle of}} the veneers’ overlapping area with a sharp paring chisel. They were immersed in a 0.1 % Brilliant Sulphaflavine solution (CAS Nr. 2391 - 30 - 2, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany), a yellow fluorescent dye which bonds selectively to basic amino-groups [23], <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the adhesive, for 2  min. After a washing step with H 2 O, a second immersing step in a 0.1 % Gentian Violet solution (CAS Nr. 548 - 62 - 9, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany) was added <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the <b>wood</b> and create a good contrast between wood and adhesive [24]. Air-dried stained specimens were observed using a reflected-light microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) with a 2.5 [*]×[*]EC Epiplan-Neofluar objective mounted. A UV-lamp and the excitation filter Zeissset 02 (365  nm) was used. Pictures were captured using a camera (Axiocam Hrc, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) operated in RGB-mode. Digital image analysis was performed with ImageJ [25] creating one binary image of glue and one binary image of veneers bottom line.|$|R
