The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms.

25|$|While no {{definitive}} biological significance of Z-DNA has been found, {{it is commonly}} believed to provide <b>torsional</b> <b>strain</b> relief (supercoiling) while DNA transcription occurs. The potential to form a Z-DNA structure also correlates with regions of active transcription.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on an Al- 6061 alloy to evaluate the separate effects of the applied pressure and the <b>torsional</b> <b>straining</b> in processing by high-pressure torsion (HPT). The values of the Vickers microhardness were measured after processing and plotted both linearly across the diameters of the disks and as three-dimensional representations. The measurements show that the applied pressure increases the hardness {{in the absence of}} <b>torsional</b> <b>straining.</b> In the presence of a pressure and <b>torsional</b> <b>straining,</b> the hardness values are high {{at the edges of the}} disk but lower in the central region. There is a gradual evolution toward a hardness homogeneity with increasing numbers of HPT revolutions. The hardness values at the edges of the disks are reasonably independent of the applied pressure but the extent of this region of high hardness depends upon both the applied pressure and the numbers of turns in the HPT processing...|$|R

The axial and <b>torsional</b> <b>strains</b> are fully recovered upon unloading. Further study of the micromechanical mechanisms at play is needed to advance the understanding of Nitinol behavior and allow for greater accuracy in modeling and actuator development.

40|$|Graphyne is a planar {{two-dimensional}} carbon allotrope {{formed by}} atoms in sp, sp 2, and sp 3 hybridized states. Topologically graphyne nanotubes (GNTs) {{can be considered}} as cylindrically rolled up graphyne sheets, similarly as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be considered rolled up graphene sheets. Due to the presence of single, double, and triple bonds, GNTs exhibit porous sidewalls that can be exploited in many diverse applications. In this work, we investigated the mechanical behavior of GNTs under <b>torsional</b> <b>strains</b> through reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that GNTs are more flexible than CNTs and exhibit 'superplasticity', with fracture angles that are up to 35 times higher than the ones reported to CNTs. This GNT 'superplastic' behavior can be explained in terms of irreversible reconstruction processes (mainly associated with the triple bonds) that occur during <b>torsional</b> <b>strains...</b>|$|R
25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the <b>torsional</b> <b>strain</b> would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce <b>torsional</b> <b>strain,</b> cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E
25|$|For instance, palladium(II) acetate {{is reduced}} by {{triphenylphosphine}} to bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (1) and triphenylphosphine is oxidized to triphenylphosphine oxide. Step A is an oxidative addition in which palladium inserts itself in the aryl to bromide bond. Palladium then forms a π complex with the alkene (3) and in step B the alkene inserts itself in the palladium - carbon bond in a syn addition step. Then follows a <b>torsional</b> <b>strain</b> relieving rotation to the trans isomer (not shown) and step C is a beta-hydride elimination step {{with the formation of}} a new palladium - alkene π complex (5). This complex is destroyed in the next step. The palladium(0) compound is regenerated by reductive elimination of the palladium(II) compound by potassium carbonate in the final step, D. In the course of the reaction the carbonate is stoichiometrically consumed and palladium is truly a catalyst and used in catalytic amounts. A similar palladium cycle but with different scenes and actors is observed in the Wacker process.|$|E
