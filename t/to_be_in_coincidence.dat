50|$|The {{coincidence}} {{range finder}} uses a single eyepiece. Light {{from the target}} enters the range finder through two windows located {{at either end of}} the instrument. At either side the incident beam is reflected to the center of the optical bar by a pentaprism. The optical bar is ideally made from a material with a low coefficient of thermal expansion so that optical path lengths do not change significantly with temperature. This reflected beam first passes through an objective lens and is then merged with the beam of the opposing side with an ocular prism sub-assembly to form two images of the target which are viewed by the observer through the eyepiece. Since either beam enters the instrument at a slightly different angle the resulting image, if unaltered, will appear blurry. Therefore, in one arm of the instrument a compensator is adjusted by the operator to tilt the beam until the two images match. At this point the images are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>coincidence.</b> The degree of rotation of the compensator determines the range to the target by simple triangulation. Coincidence rangefinders made by Barr and Stroud used two eyepieces, and may be confused with stereoscopic units. The second eyepiece showed the operator a range scale so the user could range and read the range scale simultaneously.|$|E

Also, the 64 PMT anode signals are differentiated and an overshoot threshold is applied to separate the fast decay plastic anode signals from the slower GSO signals. Finally, an energy threshold {{is applied to the}} summed anode signal to distinguish 511 keV gammas from the 140 keV gammas commonly used in sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery. Previously we reported on how these signal selection criteria were individually tested and optimized based on 9 channels of prototype electronics [1 - 2]. Currently the electronics shave been upgraded to Xilinx® programmable components, allowing on-the-fly alteration of signal selection criteria, and all 64 channels are operational. Initial measurements of the complete 64 -pixel probe were conducted using 18 F-FDG positron sources and 18 F-FDG and 99 mTcphantoms (background 511 keV and 140 keV gammas), simulating lesions in the SLN surgery environment. The average positron sensitivity is measured to be 3. 0 - 7. 0 kcps/µCi at different signal selection criteria. The lower bound on sensitivity corresponds to settings optimized for high image resolution and high background rejection ability. The upper bound on sensitivity corresponds to settings optimized for high sensitivity at the cost of lower image resolution and lower background rejection ability.

40|$|The nuclear {{levels of}} Ta 181 were {{investigated}} by {{the study of the}} [beta]-decay of Hf 181 and the electron capture decay of W 181. The previously reported 476 kev transition from the Hf 181 decay was found not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>coincidence</b> with the 482 kev transition, thus ruling out the level proposed at 958 kev. Evidence for weak M-shell conversion lines of a ~ 6 kev transition in the Hf 181 decay was found with a 180 ° [beta]-spectrometer. A [beta]-spectrometer investigation of the W 181 decay revealed strong M-shell conversion lines which correspond to a transition of 6. 25 ± 0. 3 kev in energy. On the basis of the above mentioned results and other considerations, it is concluded that the 476 kev transition in the Hf 181 decay occurs between the 482 kev level and the new 6 kev level. A 6 kev [gamma]-ray was also found in the W 181 decay with an argon proportional counter. From these studies, the conversion coefficient of the 6 kev transition was determined to be [alpha]T = 44 ± 7. The conversion coefficient and the M-subshell conversion ratios require that the 6 kev transition is of El multipolarity. From this assignment and other experimental and theoretical considerations, it is concluded that the 6 kev level is the 9 / 2 - [514] Nilsson intrinsic state. Arguments can also be made that the previously reported 152 kev transition in the W 181 decay occurs between a new 11 / 2 - rotational level at 158 kev and the 6 kev level. From a measurement of the tantalum L/K x-ray intensity ratio, the W 181 electron capture L/K branching ratio (to the ground state and the 6 kev level) is found to be PL/PK = 0. 359, and the W 181 decay energy is found to be 176 (+ 44) (- 22) kev. The branchings of this decay to the various Ta 181 levels are as follows: 158 kev (0. 12 %), 136 kev (0. 075 %), 6. 25 kev (~ 35 %), and 0 kev (~ 65 %).

40|$|A new {{coincidence}} {{technique has}} been developed and used to study the secondary electron emission that arises during the interaction of ions with surfaces. This coincidence technique allows the secondary electron emission statistics due {{to the impact of}} singly, doubly and multiply charged ions on surfaces <b>to</b> <b>be</b> measured <b>in</b> <b>coincidence</b> with reflected particles, in specific charge states and with specific post-collision trajectories. This system has <b>been</b> used <b>to</b> study the impact of 8 keV H"+ ions on polycrystalline copper and aluminium targets. Under these conditions the potential emission contribution is negligible and the electron emission is almost entirely due to kinetic emission processes. The sub-surface contribution to the observed electron emission has been isolated using two newly developed models. These models provide valuable information about the depth and amount of surface penetration and on the probability for subsequent electron transport to the surface. The impact of 2 - 100 keV Xe"q"+ (q = 1 - 10) ions on polycrystalline copper has also been studied using this system. From the subsequent data the potential and kinetic contributions to secondary electron emission have been separated using a previously established model for potential emission. The resulting kinetic emission yield increases with increasing ion impact energy, consistent with current concepts on quasimolecular ionisation. For ions impacting at large incident angles evidence for sub-surface emission has also been observed. The degree of penetration increases with ion impact energy, consistent with current concepts on this effect. The formation of H"- ions from incident H"+ ions has also been studied by measuring the secondary electron emission statistics <b>in</b> <b>coincidence</b> with reflected particles in specific final charge states. This preliminary data is consistent with a two-step process of Auger neutralisation followed by resonant electron capture to the affinity level. However this mechanism could not be positively identified due to the relatively large statistical errors involved in these measurements.

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{observed}} ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, energies {{in excess of}} $ 10 ^{ 18. 5 }$ eV) remains unknown, as extragalactic magnetic fields deflect these charged particles from their true origin. Interactions of these UHECRs at their source would invariably produce high energy neutrinos. As these neutrinos are chargeless and nearly massless, their propagation through the universe is unimpeded and their detection can be correlated with the origin of UHECRs. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{are one of the}} few possible origins for UHECRs, observed as short, immensely bright outbursts of gamma-rays at cosmological distances. The energy density of GRBs in the universe is capable of explaining the measured UHECR flux, making them promising UHECR sources. Interactions between UHECRs and the prompt gamma-ray emission of a GRB would produce neutrinos that would be detected in coincidence with the GRB’s gamma-ray emission. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory can be used to search for these neutrinos in coincidence with GRBs, detecting neutrinos through the Cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary charged particles produced in neutrino interactions in the South Pole glacial ice. Restricting these searches <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>coincidence</b> with GRB gamma-ray emis- sion, analyses can be performed with very little atmospheric background. Previous searches have focused on detecting muon tracks from muon neutrino interactions fromthe Northern Hemisphere, where the Earth shields IceCube’s primary background of atmospheric muons, or spherical cascade events from neutrinos of all flavors from the entire sky, with no compelling neutrino signal found. Neutrino searches from GRBs with IceCube have been extended to a search for muon tracks in the Southern Hemisphere in coincidence with 664 GRBs over five years of IceCube data in this dissertation. Though this region of the sky contains IceCube’s primary background of atmospheric muons, it is also where IceCube is most sensitive to neutrinos at the very highest energies as Earth absorption in the Northern Hemisphere becomes relevant. As previous neutrino searches have strongly constrained neutrino production in GRBs, a new per-GRB analysis is introduced for the first time to discover neutrinos in coincidence with possibly rare neutrino-bright GRBs. A stacked analysis is also performed to discover a weak neutrino signal distributed over many GRBs. Results of this search are found to be consistent with atmospheric muon backgrounds. Combining this result with previously published searches for muon neutrino tracks in the Northern Hemisphere, cascade event searches over the entire sky, and an extension of the Northern Hemisphere track search in three additional years of IceCube data that is consistent with atmospheric backgrounds, the most stringent limits yet can be placed on prompt neutrino production in GRBs, which increasingly disfavor GRBs as primary sources of UHECRs in current GRB models...|$|E
