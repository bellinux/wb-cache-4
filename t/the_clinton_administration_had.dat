2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill Clinton {{did not have a}} {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E
2500|$|The recess {{appointment}} {{came about}} {{due to a}} more urgent problem: the long-stalled nomination of William B. Gould IV, a Stanford University law professor. [...] President Bill Clinton had nominated Gould to the NLRB in June 1993 {{with the intention of}} naming him chair. But Gould's appointment was held up by Senator Nancy Kassebaum, who (according to the New York Times) wanted to exercise power over Republican appointments to the Board. According to Gould, Truesdale was interviewed by the Clinton administration in December 1993 and the offer of another recess appointment to the Board extended to him. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> allegedly discussed the Truesdale recess appointment with Kassebaum, and offered to not appoint Truesdale as chair; in return, Kassebaum would allow the Gould nomination to go forward. According to Gould, the administration also agreed to nominate Charles I. Cohen, a former NLRB attorney practicing with the law firm of Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart. The deal-making appeared to have worked, as Kassebaum relented on February 19, 1994. Gould was confirmed, 58 to 38, by the Senate on March 2, 1994.|$|E

40|$|Federal {{advisory}} committees, a part {{of government}} since Washington’s presidency, are gov-erned under various statutes, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). Since its 1972 passage, FACA’s ambiguity and various judicial interpretations have made it diffi-cult for agencies to determine if many government initiatives comply with FACA. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> found {{this to be a}} problem while implementing several initiatives, includ-ing health care reform and ecosystem management plans.

40|$|To {{increase}} tax revenue, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{proposed a}} 28 % new tax withholding on big winnings from slot machines, keno, and bingo. Using {{the theories of}} expected game value and utility {{and the results of}} a survey, this study analyzes the potential impact of the proposed withholding on the gaming industry. The analysis shows that the withholding, if imposed, will depress gaming demand and lower casino revenues and profits. Eventually the government may hurt itself by collecting less corporate income tax from the industry. Key words: gaming tax withholding, expected value, utility, player’s reaction, casino revenue and profits...|$|R

On October 1, 2003, a United States court of appeals rejected Jordan's claim for reimbursement for legal services related to assisting Clinton in scandals regarding Lewinsky and Paula Jones. Jordan asked the government to pay him $302,719, but he was paid only $1,215.|$|E
50|$|North Korea had {{developed}} {{weapons of mass}} destruction for several years prior to the Bush administration, and <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> sought to trade economic assistance {{for an end to the}} North Korean WMD program.

40|$|Pressure on {{traditional}} notions of US sovereignty are nowhere clearer {{than in the}} area of national security. In a number of areas, such as arms control, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> sought to achieve US foreign policy goals through multilateral international institutions. Pursuing national security through international organizations confers certain advantages for US policymakers, such as allowing the United States to act under the aegis of multilateralism, which submerges the prominence of US national interests and allows for the use of collective military resources. Acting through such alliances, however, raises policy and constitutional difficulties that pose problems for US notions of democratic accountability and the separation of powers. This paper will address these issues by describing the impact of multilateral interventions, such as those in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Haiti, upon the US system of war powers...|$|R

During the Clinton administration, the EPA's budget was increased, {{and much of the}} country's natural resources were put under greater protection, such as the restoration of the Everglades and the increase in size of the Everglades National Park.

5000|$|Wendy Sherman was the Clinton administration's policy {{coordinator}} for North Korea. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> first {{arrived at the}} 1994 Agreed Framework under which, North Korea agreed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear weapons program, including its main reactor at Yongbyon (Sherman continues to defend the 1994 deal and her involvement in it, stating that [...] "during the Clinton administration not one ounce of plutonium {{was added to the}} North Korean stockpile"). Sherman later headed North Korean negotiation policy until 2001. In 2001, following years of secret negotiations with Kim Jong Il, North Korea had promised not to produce, test or deploy missiles with a range of more than 300 miles. That offer would prevent North Korea from fielding missiles that could strike the United States. North Korea also offered to halt the sale of missiles, missile components, technology and training.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, {{privately funded}} {{research}} {{led to the}} breakthrough discovery of human embryonic stem cells (hESC). This prompted the Clinton administration to re-examine guidelines for federal funding of embryonic research. In 1999, the president's National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended that hESC harvested from embryos discarded after in vitro fertility treatments, but not from embryos created expressly for experimentation, be eligible for federal funding. Though embryo destruction had been inevitable {{in the process of}} harvesting hESC in the past (this is no longer the case), <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> decided that it would be permissible under the Dickey Amendment to fund hESC research as long as such research did not itself directly cause the destruction of an embryo. Therefore, HHS issued its proposed regulation concerning hESC funding in 2001. Enactment of the new guidelines was delayed by the incoming George W. Bush administration which decided to reconsider the issue.|$|E
50|$|In January 1993, Clinton {{appointed}} W. Anthony Lake as his National Security Adviser. Lake, {{a former}} Foreign Service officer, served under Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's National Security Adviser, and {{as director of}} the Department of State Policy Planning Staff during the Carter administration. During the Carter years, Lake had witnessed the negative effects of bureaucratic infighting and squabbling between then Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. As Clinton's National Security Adviser, Lake was effective in maintaining cordial relations with Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher and in developing an atmosphere of cooperation and collegiality. Lake initially maintained a low public profile, avoiding public appearances and television interviews, so as not to upstage the Secretary of State as Kissinger had done in the Nixon administration. In September 1993, however, in response to criticism that <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> not adequately explained its foreign policy, Lake began to appear as a public speaker.|$|E

40|$|The US–Japan {{trade dispute}} {{has been widely}} reported.

In light of this, this paper examines how the pattern of Japan’s total multilateral trade and trade with the United States has changed between 1981 and 1991. It finds that between 1986 and 1991, {{more than half of the}} growth in Japan’s total multilateral trade, and all of the growth in trade with the United States, was a result of intraindustry trade growth. The paper also finds that most of the growth in intra-industry trade is a result of import growth in net export industries. This is the type of trade that the United States has been urging Japan to increase and is consistent with an opening-up of the Japanese market. ...|$|R
