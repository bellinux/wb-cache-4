No regulatory body is specifically responsible for the establishment of accounting principles. In several accounting areas, mandatory requirements for accounting practices are included in the Companies Act. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has during the last few years issued the following accounting standards and guidance notes. The accounting in the past was restricted to the record keeping but today it covers a wide range of activities involving business planning and control, decision making, problem solving, performance measurement and evaluation, co-coordinating and directing auditing and tax determination and cost planning and management, etc. But the accounting in wholesale and retail business is restricted to cash book, ledger, trial balance, <b>trading</b> <b>account,</b> <b>profit</b> and loss account and balance sheet and submitting these to tax authorities and banks at the end of financial year for verification and tax purpose and for continuation of banking facilities...|$|E

Information relevance is understood herein as a multidimensional attribute that is closely related to the quality and usefulness of the information conveyed by <b>accounting</b> <b>profits.</b> The associative capacity and information timeliness of <b>accounting</b> <b>profits</b> in relation to share prices were examined. Furthermore, the level of conditional conservatism present in <b>accounting</b> <b>profits</b> was also analyzed because according to Basu (1997), this aspect is related to timeliness. The study used pooled regressions and panel data models to analyze the quarterly <b>accounting</b> <b>profits</b> of 246 companies between the first quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of 2013, resulting in 9, 558 quarter-company observations. The results indicated that the adoption of IFRS in Brazil (1) increased the associative capacity of accounting profits; (2) reduced information timeliness to non-significant levels; and (3) had no effect on conditional conservatism.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the argument that}} accounting rules make the corporate income tax less salient and less distortionary by obscuring the timing of tax payments. I develop and estimate a model of investment where firms maximize a discounted weighted average of after-tax cash flows and <b>accounting</b> <b>profits.</b> The cost of capital, the tax wedge on the return on capital, {{and the impact of}} tax incentives for investment depend on the weight placed on <b>accounting</b> <b>profits.</b> I estimate this weight by comparing the effectiveness of tax incentives that do and do not affect <b>accounting</b> <b>profits.</b> Investment tax credits, which do affect <b>accounting</b> <b>profits,</b> have more impact on investment than accelerated depreciation, which does not. I argue that the difference in estimated impact is not driven by discounting, cash flow effects, or measurement error. The difference is larger among firms with higher measures of earnings management. Results thus suggest that the tax burden on corporate capital is lower than we would otherwise estimate, and accelerated depreciation provisions are less effective than they otherwise would be...|$|R

40|$|On the {{traditional}} microeconomic theory, firms {{are supposed to}} maximise the aggregate pure profit. We study other objective functions which are ratios profit over capital. We explore various combinations, proposing a typology of the ratios o f profit, particularly the rate of <b>profit</b> (<b>accounting</b> <b>profit</b> over capital), the rate o f gross profit (gross profit over capital), the rate of <b>accounting</b> <b>profit</b> (<b>accounting</b> <b>profit</b> over capital). The cases of monopoly with variable coefficient of capital, monopoly with fix coefficient of capital, competition with fix coefficient of capital, are studied. The solutions given by the maximisation of the aggregate pure profit and the maximisation of the rate o f profit are compared. We conclude to a usually lower volume of production with the maximisation of the rate o f profit. Thus, as firms are smaller, competition may be greater; however the clearing of the market must be studied; in competition at the very long term, with the rate o f profit maximisation, the pure profit remain positive. 26 pages, figures, graphique...|$|R
