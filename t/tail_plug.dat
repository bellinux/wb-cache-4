40|$|Gene 9 of phage T 4 {{specifies}} {{a protein}} {{needed in the}} assembly of the virus particle, whose site of action is on the baseplate. Assembly without gene 9 product results {{in the production of}} inactive particles which lack tail fibers. These defective particles can be converted to complete active phage in vitro by the sequential action of the gene 9 product and the addition of tail fibers. Gene 9 defective particles are unstable and spontaneously convert to an aberrant "triggered" form that has a contracted sheath, but retains the DNA in the head. Action of the gene 9 product on the particle stabilizes it from converting to the triggered form, provides for DNA release when the sheath contracts during infection, and provides sites on the baseplate for the attachment of tail fibers. For the particle to be subsequently active the gene 9 product must act at least three times on the gene 9 defective particle; there is some experimental evidence to suggest that the gene 9 product may act on the particle stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. A model is proposed for the action of the gene 9 product on the particle in which six gene 9 products are incorporated into the baseplate. These components join the <b>tail</b> <b>plug</b> to the baseplate vertices such that the change which occurs in baseplate configuration during infection will eliminate the <b>tail</b> <b>plug</b> by pulling it apart. Removal of the <b>tail</b> <b>plug</b> opens the end of the core to allow DNA release. The attachment site for the tail fiber on the baseplate is proposed to be at the junction of the gene 9 product and the baseplate...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the T 4 D bacteriophage gene 28 product in folate metabolism in infected Escherichia coli cells by using antifolate drugs and a newly devised assay for folyl polyglutamate cleavage activity. Preincubation of host E. coli cells with various sulfa drugs inhibited phage production by decreasing the burst size when the phage particles produced an altered gene 28 product (i. e., after infection under permissive conditions with T 4 D 28 ts or T 4 D am 28). In addition, we found that another folate analog, pyrimethamine, also inhibited T 4 D 28 ts production and T 4 D 28 am production, but this analog did not inhibit wild-type T 4 D production. A temperature-resistant revertant of T 4 D 28 ts was not sensitive to either sulfa drugs or pyrimethamine. We developed an assay to measure the enzymatic cleavage of folyl polyglutamates. The high-molecular-weight folyl polyglutamate substrate was isolated from E. coli B cells infected with T 4 D am 28 in the presence of labeled glutamic acid and was characterized as a folate compound containing 12 to 14 labeled glutamate residues. Extracts of uninfected bacteria liberated glutamate residues from this substrate with a pH optimum of 8. 4 to 8. 5. Extracts of bacteriophage T 4 D-infected E. coli B cells exhibited an additional new folyl polyglutamate cleavage activity with a pH optimum of about 6. 4 to 6. 5, which was clearly distinguished from the preexisting activity in the uninfected host cells. This new activity was induced in E. coli B cells by infection with wild-type T 4 D and T 4 D amber mutants 29 −, 26 −, 27 −, 51 −, and 10 −, but it was not induced under nonpermissive conditions by T 4 D am 28 or by T 4 D 28 ts. Mutations in gene 28 affected the properties of the induced cleavage enzyme. Wild-type T 4 D-induced cleavage activity was not inhibited by pyrimethamine, whereas the T 4 D 28 ts activity induced at a permissive temperature was inhibited by this folate analog. Folyl polyglutamate cleavage activity characteristic of the activity induced in host cells by wild-type T 4 D or by T 4 D gene 28 mutants was also found in highly purified preparations of these phage ghost particles. The T 4 D-induced cleavage activity could be inhibited by antiserum prepared against highly purified phage baseplates. We concluded that T 4 D infection induced the formation of a new folyl polyglutamate cleavage enzyme and that this enzyme was coded for by T 4 D gene 28. Furthermore, since this gene product was a baseplate <b>tail</b> <b>plug</b> component which had both its antigenic sites and its catalytic sites exposed on the phage particle, it was apparent that this enzyme formed part of the distal surface of the phage baseplate central <b>tail</b> <b>plug...</b>|$|E
40|$|The T 4 D {{bacteriophage}} gene 28 {{product is}} {{a component of}} the central plug of the tail baseplate, as shown by the following two independent lines of evidence. (i) A highly sensitive method for radioactive labeling of only tail baseplate plug components was developed. These labeled plug components were incorporated by a complementation procedure into new phage particles and were analyzed by radioautography after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three new structural proteins were found in addition to the three known <b>tail</b> <b>plug</b> proteins (i. e., gP 29, gP 27, and gP 5). One of the three newly identified components had a molecular weight of 24, 000 to 25, 000 and appeared to be a product of T 4 D gene 28. (ii) Characterization of mutants of Escherichia coli bacteriophage T 4 D which produced altered gene 28 products also indicated that the gene 28 product was a viral tail component. T 4 D 28 ts phage particles produced at the permissive temperature had altered heat labilities compared with parent T 4 D particles. We isolated a single-step temperature revertant of T 4 D 28 ts and found that it produced phage particles which phenotypically resembled the original T 4 D particles. Since the properties of the phage baseplate components usually determine heat lability, these two changes in physical stability after two sequential single mutations in gene 28 supported the other evidence that the gene 28 product was a viral baseplate component. Also, compared with parent T 4 D particles, T 4 D 28 ts and T 4 D 28 am viral particles adsorbed at different rates to various types of host cells. In addition, T 4 D 28 ts particles exhibited a different host range than parent T 4 D particles. This T 4 D mutant formed plaques with an extremely low efficiency on all E. coli K- 12 strains tested. We found that although T 4 D 28 ts particles adsorbed rapidly and irreversibly to the E. coli K- 12 strains, as judged by gene rescue experiments, these particles were not able to inject their DNA into the E. coli K- 12 strains. On the other hand, the T 4 D 28 ts revertant had a plating efficiency on E. coli K- 12 strains that was quite similar to the plating efficiency of the original parent, T 4 D. These properties of phage particles containing an altered gene 28 product supported the analytical finding that the gene 28 product is a structural component of the central plug of the T 4 D tail baseplate. They also indicated that this component plays a role in both host cell recognition and viral DNA injection...|$|E

50|$|A {{volcanic}} plug, {{also called}} a volcanic neck or lava neck, is a volcanic object created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano.

40|$|Genotyping {{of genetically}} {{modified}} mice and control of authenticity of the genetic background of congenic or coisogenic strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a routine procedure that can be performed with different tissue biopsies causing variable grades of trauma. In this study, some invasive and non-invasive sampling methods were compared, with the main focus on the impact on animal physiology. We compared ear punch, <b>tail</b> biopsy, hair <b>plugging,</b> mouth and rectum swabs and the simple restraint of the animals, scoring for the impact on heart rate (HR), core body temperature (BT) and motor activity by telemetry, during biopsy and for the following 6 h. Furthermore, in order to correlate the physiological impact with the practicability and reliability of the genotyping results, we performed a PCR analysis of the biopsy samples obtained by using the same collection procedures analysed by telemetry. All sampling methods and restraint induced significant increase in HR and BT and {{a slight increase in}} motor activity for 1 h, independent of the invasiveness of the method used. Genotyping of all biopsies allowed the proper identification of transgenic animals, tail biopsies, ear punches and hair follicles giving clear signals, the last method being fast, but also susceptible to cross contaminations during sampling by large numbers of animals. Restraint and all biopsy methods provoked similar physiological changes, indicating that the handling of the animals is of major importance and that the sampling procedure does not strongly influence the physiological parameters...|$|R
40|$|Fluid flow is {{essential}} for the transport of metabolites to, from and within the intervertebral disc. By applying quadriphasic mixture theory experimentally, this study relates fluid flow within the bovine nucleus pulposus (NP) to the applied fluid pressure gradients and fixed charge and mobile ion concentration gradients. 24 plugs of NP tissue (diameter 10 mm, height 1020 ± 122 µm (mean ± S. D)), orientated in the axial direction, were harvested from bovine <b>tail</b> discs. The <b>plugs</b> were permeated with either; 0 M NaCl, 0. 15 M NaCl or 3 M NaCl solutions by subjecting them to 30, 45 and 60 kPa fluid pressure gradients applied in a random sequence. The hypertonic solution was assumed to render all non-fluid pressure gradients negligible, whilst the hypotonic solution was assumed to render the mobile ion concentration gradient negligible. The effects of these gradients on fluid flow were expressed {{as a percentage of the}} applied fluid pressure. Fluid velocity was significantly increased through the tissue in the isotonic case compared to the hypertonic case by up to 55 % of the applied fluid pressure. The fixed charges accounted for between 26 - 43 % and the mobile ion gradient responsible for 12 - 26 % of this increased fluid flow. These results highlight the importance of using a constitutive equation for permeability that includes mobile ions and fixed charges as separate phases when modelling cartilaginous tissue in order to better describe fluid flow, and thus convective transfer of metabolites, within the tissue...|$|R
40|$|Cold Flow Technology” (CFT) is an {{alternative}} solution to deal with gas hydrate formation in subsea flowlines. Transient multiphase flow with gas hydrate particles is an important research area of the CFT, {{which has not been}} thoroughly investigated yet. Therefore, this PhD program was initiated as a basis for further research on this aspect of the CFT. Investigation on the phase equilibrium of gas hydrate particles was {{the second part of the}} present study. The subject was chosen as the CFT relies on the transportation of thermodynamically stable gas hydrate particles. The first step of the PhD work was designing and building a new experimental facility at the multiphase flow laboratory of the Department of Energy and Process Engineering (NTNU-EPT). The setup consisted of an asymmetrical V-shape pipe capable of measuring flow rate, pressure and particle volume fraction. The experiments were carried out using polymeric particles representing real hydrate particles and with water as the model fluid. Finding a proper model hydrate particle and preparing a sufficient quantity of the model particle were the most challenging parts of this work completed in cooperation with the SINTEF Materials and Chemistry group. A hydrophobic model hydrate particle was initially chosen based on different criteria like density, availability and cost. In the next step, 150 Kg of the model particle were purchased, degassed and sieved. Eventually, the surface properties of the particles were modified using very high concentration chemicals. The surface treated particles could be dispersed in water without adding any chemicals. In order to investigate the transient flow behavior of a potential hydrate plug during re-start operation of a subsea flowline facilitated with CFT, a series of experiments on flowline re-start was undertaken. The results of the experiments showed an additional frictional pressure drop due to the movement of the hydrate plug, especially in the bend. Moreover, the average particle phase velocity of the dispersed phase flowing in front of the hydrate plug was higher than the mixture velocity in the majority of the measured data. The increased particle velocity may be due to dispersion of the hydrate plug in water. Despite the particle phase velocity in front of the hydrate plug, the average particle phase velocity of the <b>plug</b> <b>tail</b> was slightly lower than the mixture velocity. In order to model the plug flow experiments, a simple one dimensional flow model was initially developed using the continuity equation and without considering any extra terms. However, benchmarking of the flow model showed that more physical details should be included in the model. Therefore, the initial model was developed further, taking into account the axial dispersion of the particle phase, the increased particle phase velocity caused by the plug front dispersion and the additional frictional pressure drop caused by the hydrate plug. The effect of axial dispersion was taken into account by adding a diffusion term to the particle phase continuity equation. The effect of plug front dispersion on increasing the particle phase velocity was determined by applying a mass balance at the plug front. The modified model was capable of qualitatively reproducing the results of the plug flow experiments. The thermodynamic stability of gas hydrate particles was investigated by proposing two thermodynamic models both based on the Van der Waals - Platteeuw theory. Since wellstream water is an electrolyte solution, the models were developed to precisely predict the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions of gas hydrates in presence of electrolyte solutions. As the starting point, the rather simple Pitzer model was used to calculate the water activity in electrolyte solutions. The parameters of the Pitzer model were adjusted using the experimental data at the lowest temperature found in the literature. A mixing rule was proposed to obtain the activity of water in mixed electrolyte solutions. The results of the model were in good agreement with experimental data. In the second thermodynamic model, a Mean Spherical Approximation (MSA) based model was employed to compute the water activity in electrolyte solutions. Initially and in order to improve the accuracy of the model, a new relation was proposed for describing the concentration dependency of the model’s adjustable parameters at 25 oC. Then, the adjustable parameters were extended with respect to temperature variations within the gas hydrate equilibrium conditions. In addition, the model was extended to calculate the solubility of CO 2 in single and mixed electrolyte solutions. The results of the proposed work both on computing CO 2 solubility and the gas hydrates equilibrium conditions were in good agreement with the experimental data and those presented in other works. Fewer adjustable parameters and the capability of modeling a mixture with different species can illustrate the complexity of the MSA based model. For instance, in case of a need for chemical injection, the MSA based model might be extended accordingly. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|R
