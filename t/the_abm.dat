The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy.

5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, taking out full page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support.

40|$|Abstract Background One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing biomedical research is the integration and sharing of vast amounts of information, not only for individual researchers, but also for the community at large. Agent Based Modeling (ABM) can provide a means of addressing this challenge via a unifying translational architecture for dynamic knowledge representation. This paper presents a series of linked ABMs representing multiple levels of biological organization. They are intended to translate the knowledge derived from in vitro models of acute inflammation to clinically relevant phenomenon such as multiple organ failure. Results and Discussion ABM development followed a sequence starting with relatively direct translation from in-vitro derived rules into a cell-as-agent level ABM, leading on to concatenated ABMs into multi-tissue models, eventually resulting in topologically linked aggregate multi-tissue ABMs modeling organ-organ crosstalk. As an underlying design principle organs were considered to be functionally composed of an epithelial surface, which determined organ integrity, and an endothelial/blood interface, representing the reaction surface for the initiation and propagation of inflammation. The development of <b>the</b> epithelial <b>ABM</b> derived from an in-vitro model of gut epithelial permeability is described. Next, <b>the</b> epithelial <b>ABM</b> was concatenated with <b>the</b> endothelial/inflammatory cell <b>ABM</b> to produce an organ model of the gut. This model was validated against in-vivo models of the inflammatory response of the gut to ischemia. Finally, <b>the</b> gut <b>ABM</b> was linked to a similarly constructed pulmonary <b>ABM</b> to simulate <b>the</b> gut-pulmonary axis in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure. The behavior of this model was validated against in-vivo and clinical observations on the cross-talk between these two organ systems Conclusion A series of ABMs are presented extending from the level of intracellular mechanism to clinically observed behavior in the intensive care setting. <b>The</b> <b>ABMs</b> all utilize cell-level agents that encapsulate specific mechanistic knowledge extracted from in vitro experiments. The execution of <b>the</b> <b>ABMs</b> results in a dynamic representation of the multi-scale conceptual models derived from those experiments. These models represent a qualitative means of integrating basic scientific information on acute inflammation in a multi-scale, modular architecture as a means of conceptual model verification that can potentially be used to concatenate, communicate and advance community-wide knowledge. </p...|$|R

25|$|Unveiled in 2006, <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> {{project was}} a {{surprise}} to many observers. While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. <b>The</b> <b>ABM</b> project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious Akash missile and Trishul missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 serious {{efforts to}} explore <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> problem started. By {{this point the}} US and USSR had agreed in <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> Treaty to deploy up to 100 ABMs at only two sites. MIRVs had so seriously upset the balance between ABM and ICBM that both parties agreed to limit ABM {{deployment}} largely {{as a way of}} avoiding a massive buildup of new ICBMs. The only good news for the UK in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing; their attacks {{had to be able to}} credibly defeat a 100-interceptor ABM defense around Moscow. Thus started project KH.793, a one-year project to identify potential solutions.|$|E

25|$|The Army {{picked up}} these options, {{developing}} two concepts. The first, Project Quick-Shot, was basically {{identical to the}} Feld and Tsipis version, although they did consider some sort of low-cost guidance system as well. A second concept launched optical trackers into space {{in the path of}} the incoming missiles, and used their data to fine-tune the launch of unguided rockets that would work at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> treaty over the number and placement of radar sites.|$|E
25|$|A better {{understanding}} of Nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) presented new problems; a warhead set off at high altitudes and long ranges from the defensive missiles could blind the radars, making the incoming warheads only become visible at lower altitudes. This would further {{reduce the amount of}} time <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> system had to react. Systems using non-obvious approaches might be able to blind the radars in a sneak attack; the Soviets developed the R-36 with a system called Fractional Orbital Bombardment System to allow attacks on US missile fields from low altitudes and/or from the south, while the US relied on manned bombers for the same role.|$|E

25|$|With President Jimmy Carter's {{decision}} to base the MX {{in a series}} of less-hardened horizontal silos in 1977, LoADS development was accelerated. The system as a whole was renamed Sentry, with the missile becoming the Baseline Terminal Defense System, or BTDS. Work on MX and Sentry was further accelerated by incoming President Ronald Reagan in 1981. However, after another review of the MX program, Reagan chose a different MX deployment concept and cancelled Sentry, stating that it would violate <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> treaty. As the questionable security of the MX once again became an issue, Reagan briefly entertained an even shorter-range system known as Swarmjet, before the entire MX program was severely curtailed with the ending of the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} U.S. Navy Polaris had {{not been}} designed to penetrate anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses, but the Royal Navy had to ensure that its small Polaris force operating alone, and often with only one submarine on deterrent patrol, could penetrate <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> screen around Moscow. The result was a programme called Chevaline that added multiple decoys, chaff, and other defensive countermeasures. Its existence was only revealed in 1980, {{partly because of the}} cost overruns of the project, which had almost quadrupled the original estimate given when the project was finally approved in January 1975. The system became operational in mid-1982 on , and the last British SSBN submarine was equipped with it in mid-1987. Withdrawn from service in 1996.|$|E

40|$|Climate and {{environmental}} changes are argued {{to increase the}} occurrence of conflict. In particular, two types of conflict seem {{to be driven by}} underlying environmental processes: food and fuel riots. Although research focussed on understanding the dynamics that cause food riots exists, the evidence is mixed and a solid quantitative analysis on the factors that cause these type of events is missing. Research on fuel riots is currently non-existent. The aim of this research was hence to identify, quantify and simulate the interconnections between scarcity of natural resources, international prices, political fragility and the occurrence of food and fuel riots. The approach implemented was mainly quantitative, with use of statistics, econometrics and Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). These methods allowed a parameterisation of these relationships and inclusion of the results in three different version of an ABM: Food, Fuel and Food and Fuel <b>ABMs.</b> <b>The</b> findings show that national availability of resources does not significantly impact the occurrence of food and fuel riots, while international prices and national political fragility do. Thresholds above which riots are more likely to happen were identified for both the price of food and fuel. For food, volatility was found to have a bigger impact than absolute prices, while for fuel the evidence was mixed and more research is required. In addition, food and fuel riots increase the likelihood of one another. Although the introduction of these parameters in <b>the</b> <b>ABMs</b> did not add to the predictive power of the underlying statistical models, <b>the</b> <b>ABMs</b> form <b>the</b> basis for further developments, in particular as regards the evolution of shocks to the production of resources and consequences in terms of food and fuel riots.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of routinely collected animal based measures (ABMs) for an evaluatio n of the overall animal welfare in dairy cow herds. ABMs being able to detect worst adverse effects in relation to animal welfare were identified based on the existing literature and expert opinion. The validity and robustness of these ABMs were evaluated and cow mortality, somatic cell count and lameness were selected for further study. A number of factors of variation were selected using expert opinion and used in a model to collate routinely collected data from Italy, Belgium and Denmark on selected <b>ABMs.</b> <b>The</b> routinely collected data was uploaded to the Data Collection Framework platform at EFSA and the data management in this process was evaluated. Five research datasets from Italy, Belgium, Denmark and France including information on ABMs as well as a m easure of ’overall animal welfare’ at herd level were analysed to evaluate the association between <b>the</b> <b>ABMs</b> (individually or in combination) and overall welfare. The measure of ’overall animal welfare’ were not the same for all datasets. Except from the It alian data, the association between <b>the</b> <b>ABMs</b> and <b>the</b> different overall welfare measures were generally weak. Likewise, combining more than one <b>ABM</b> only improved <b>the</b> prediction of the overall welfare in the Italian dataset. Analyses of the other datasets co uld not confirm this finding. Finally, suggestions for future recordings of ABMs not routinely collected at the moment were given with a special focus on lameness. In conclusion, t he relationship between selected ABMs and overall welfare at the herd level is complex and still not sufficiently studied. Therefore, a system using routinely collected <b>ABMs</b> to predict <b>the</b> overall welfare at herd level in dairy herds does not seem realistic based on the results from the present stud...|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} both the US and USSR {{were working on}} anti-ballistic missile systems. Developing an ABM system was largely an {{engineering}} issue, requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour. Even though these items would be expensive, <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> interceptor itself was likely to cost {{about the same as}} an ICBM (or less), so any increase in the enemy's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount. This was a game the US was clearly willing to play, although it would seem the USSR was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries' respective economies.|$|E
25|$|Making {{matters worse}} was the continual {{increase}} in ICBM numbers. Even before the systems {{were ready for}} use, the number of interceptor missiles needed to effectively deter an attack kept increasing. As <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> systems were expensive, it appeared {{the simplest way to}} defeat them was to simply make more ICBMs and deliberately start an arms race the defender could not win. The introduction of MIRV systems dramatically upset this in the favour of the attack; missiles now carried several warheads that would be dispersed over wide areas, so now every new ICBM built would require a small fleet of ABMs to counter it. Both the US and USSR rushed to introduce new weapons with MIRV systems, and the number of warheads in the world rapidly proliferated.|$|E
25|$|LoADS {{proposed}} placing one interceptor {{in one of}} the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters {{would have}} one MX, one LoADS and 21 decoys. At first glance it might appear that only one additional enemy warhead would be needed, using up the LoADS interceptor. However, only the defender knew where the MX was, and LoADS would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to be sure the MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the LoADS. For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if LoADS remained within the 100-interceptor limit of <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> treaty, 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads.|$|E

The experimental condition involved Productive Failure (PF), where one group of learners initially used a set of ABMs in an unscaffolded manner whereas the comparison condition (Non-PF or N-PF) used a more conventional physics education laboratory approach in which the learners were provided with steps to follow in their ABM activity. Both groups then used <b>the</b> <b>ABMs</b> for a second activity that was scaffolded, followed by a third unscaffolded ABM problem-based activity that was the same for both conditions.
