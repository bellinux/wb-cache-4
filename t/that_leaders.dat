5|$|Noam Chomsky, a {{linguist}} {{and political}} scientist, surprised many by {{coming to the}} defense of sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature {{in order to be able}} to struggle for a better society, claiming <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> should know what human needs were in order to build a better society.|$|E
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|Somerset had {{performed}} well but missed out narrowly {{in both the}} other one-day competitions in 2009, and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match. News filtered through to the County Ground during their final match, against Durham, <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> Sussex had lost to Worcestershire, meaning that a win against the north-eastern team would guarantee Somerset the title. The result rarely looked likely; a rapid opening to the chase by Durham openers Phil Mustard and Ian Blackwell provided a platform for their team to claim victory, and deny Somerset the title. Three of Somerset's bowlers claimed ten or more wickets in the competition (Ben Phillips, 14; Alfonso Thomas, 13; Charl Willoughby, 11), {{more than any other}} county in Division One.|$|E

25|$|Karl Giberson {{argues that}} when {{discussing}} compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals {{are taken into}} account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant. Cynthia Tolman notes that religion {{does not have a}} method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, {{but when it comes to}} Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, and experience to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.|$|E
25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E
25|$|Also {{writing for}} the Financial Times, Alan Beattie was less optimistic than Mr Wolf about {{the chances of a}} {{collaborative}} solution, as he considers China and America have too divergent views on currency to be able to co-operate.

25|$|Mearsheimer wrote a {{book that}} {{analyzes}} lying in international politics. He argues in Why Leaders Lie (Oxford University Press, 2011) <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> lie to foreign audiences {{as well as their}} own people because they think it is good for their country. For example, he maintains that President Franklin D. Roosevelt lied about the Greer incident in September 1941, because he was deeply committed to getting the United States into World War II, which he thought was in America's national interest.|$|E
25|$|Xiang Yu is {{depicted}} as a ruthless leader, {{in sharp contrast to}} his rival, Liu Bang. He was a mass murderer, ordering the massacres of entire cities when they refused to surrender and put up strong resistance. The most notorious example of his cruelty was when he ordered the 200,000 surrendered Qin troops to be buried alive after the Battle of Julu, and the gruesome methods of execution he employed against his enemies and critics. Conversely, Liu Bang is portrayed as a shrewd and cunning ruler who can be brutal at times. However, Liu Bang forbade his troops from looting the cities they captured and he spared the lives of the citizens, earning their support and trust in return. Xiang Yu's story became an example for Confucianists to advocate the idea <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> should rule with benevolence and not govern by instilling fear in the people. However, his ambitions ended with the collapse of Western Chu, his defeat by Liu Bang, and his death at the early age of around 30.|$|E
25|$|Machiavelli is {{generally}} {{seen as being}} critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the teleological Aristotelianism that the church had come to accept, allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary ideals and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to providence or, as he would put it, chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, {{and the pursuit of}} glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> should have virtues, especially prudence, Machiavelli's use of the words virtù and prudenza was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.|$|E

50|$|In May 2001, Douglas sued {{his former}} psychiatrist, Dr. William <b>Leader,</b> {{claiming}} <b>that</b> <b>Leader</b> prescribed him {{a combination of}} prescription drugs that are lethal when combined with alcohol. Douglas asserted <b>that</b> <b>Leader,</b> who had been treating Douglas for his drug addictions for ten years, failed to consider his alcohol problem when he prescribed Vicodin, Klonopin, and Xanax. Douglas claimed the drugs caused him to feel suicidal and also caused an episode of cardiac arrest which led him to require constant care and hospitalization. Douglas sought $50,000 in damages from Leader.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggesting <b>that</b> <b>leader</b> transitions {{increase the}} probability of war termination {{is based on the}} assumption <b>that</b> <b>leader</b> change is exogenous. However, the exogeneity of leader change needs to be tested, not assumed. This paper uses a bivariate discrete survival model to test the exogeneity of leader change and correctly estimate its partial effect on war termination. The paper extends the analysis by estimating a competing risks model of types of leader transitions. The evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>leader</b> change in large coalition systems never increases {{the probability of}} war termination, while leader change in small coalition systems never reduces the probability of war termination. In short, leader transitions in autocratic systems are more likely to bring interstate war to an end than leader transitions in democratic ones. The study also shows that the marginal effect of leader change fades away as the war progresses, and that war has negative duration-dependence. © 2012 International Studies Association...|$|R
25|$|The first, {{beginning}} in the 1950s, was {{the inclusion of the}} Lieberman clause, named for Talmudic scholar and Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) professor Saul Lieberman, in the ketuba, requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of {{the separation of church and}} state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.|$|E

500|$|The CCDI (and {{its local}} affiliates) enforces the inner-party {{supervision}} system. Although the system's history {{dates back to}} the 1970s and 1980s, it was not formalised until the 2004 [...] "Internal Supervision Regulation" [...] (ISR). The ISR reaffirmed the powers of the CCDI, institutionalised the central inspection teams and clearly separated the Party's decision-making institutions from its supervisory ones. With the ISR the CPC issued a list of member responsibilities subject to oversight by the CCDI and its local affiliates. Member supervision was not new; however, information on what was supervised (and explanations for why things were under supervision) was novel. Every party member is subject to supervision, but the ISR emphasises <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> would be its focus. This was probably in reaction to the fact that no institutions except the central party leadership (including the local CDIs) had the de facto ability to supervise lower-level party institutions.|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of hierarchy and leadership {{is also a}} significant element. The overarching hierarchy of race is informed by Victorian concepts, influenced by the new theories of evolution proposed by Darwin and others. In morals and culture, the natives are placed lower on the evolutionary ladder than are Europeans, as is evidenced in {{the battle over the}} native woman Avatea, which pits [...] "the forces of civilization versus the forces of cannibalism". Another hierarchy is seen in the organisation of the boys. Although Jack, Ralph and Peterkin each have a say in how they should organise themselves, ultimately the younger boys defer to Jack, [...] "a natural leader", particularly in a crisis, forming a natural hierarchy. The pirates also have a hierarchy, but one without democracy, and as a consequence are wiped out. The hierarchy of the natives is imposed by savagery. Ballantyne's message is <b>that</b> <b>leaders</b> should be respected by those they lead, and govern with their consent. This educational message is especially appropriate considering Ballantyne's adolescent audience, [...] "the future rulers of the world".|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicated <b>that</b> <b>leader</b> moral identity (i. e., leaders’ self-definition {{in terms}} of moral attributes) predicts to what extent followers perceive their leader as ethical (i. e., demonstrating and promoting ethical conduct in the organization). Leadership, however, is a relational process <b>that</b> involves <b>leaders</b> and followers. Building on this understanding, we hypothesized <b>that</b> follower and <b>leader</b> moral identity (a) interact in predicting whether followers will perceive their leaders as ethical and, as a result, (b) influence followers’ perceptions of leader–follower relationship quality. A dyadic field study (N = 101) shows <b>that</b> <b>leader</b> moral identity is a stronger predictor of followers’ perceptions of ethical leadership for followers who are high (vs. low) in moral identity. Perceptions of ethical leadership in turn predict how {{the quality of the}} relationship will be perceived. Hence, whether leader moral identity translates to perceptions of ethical leadership and of better relationship quality depends on the moral identity of followers...|$|R
