5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 World Championship {{began with}} O'Sullivan {{defeating}} Dave Harold 10–4, {{followed by a}} struggle through to a 13–10 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10–6 going into the final session. A fightback by Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13–11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi–finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8–8 {{at the end of}} the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the cue, before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his cue and case to a boy in the crowd. A BBC report claimed he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new cue. O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of the desert locust {{consists}} of three stages, the egg, the nymph known as a hopper, and the winged adult.

25|$|Cicero's cognomen, or {{personal}} surname, {{comes from the}} Latin for chickpea, cicer. Plutarch explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose resembling a chickpea. However, {{it is more likely}} that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas. Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames. The famous family names of Fabius, Lentulus, and Piso come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas, respectively. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make Cicero more glorious than Scaurus ("Swollen-ankled") and Catulus ("Puppy").|$|E

25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E

500|$|The {{portrait}} is {{not particularly}} well preserved. There are yellowish layers of glaze over the face, probably later additions.

500|$|Hoffman sat {{out most}} of the 2003 season while {{recovering}} from two offseason shoulder surgeries, including one that trimmed <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> scapula. It marked {{the first time he had}} been on the disabled list after 10 major league seasons. In his absence, Rod Beck closed for the Padres. [...] Hoffman pitched his first game in 2003 on September 2 with a perfect seventh inning in a 6–3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He pitched in nine games in 2003, all non-save situations, with an ERA of 2.00 and 11 strikeouts in 9 innings. Coming off the injury, the Padres bought out their $10 million option on Hoffman for 2004 for $2 million and agreed to a new deal with a $2.5 million salary for 2004 including $500,000 in incentives and an option for 2005. In the Padres inaugural season at their new home in Petco Park in 2004, Hoffman returned to the closer role and finished with 41saves with a 2.30ERA, his lowest since 1998. He passed Jeff Reardon(367) and Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley(390) to end the season third on the all-time saves list.

500|$|The {{casualties}} were also high among the commanders of the charge. Trimble and Pettigrew {{were the most}} senior casualties of the day; Trimble lost a leg, and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand (only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia). In Pickett's division, 26 of the 40 field grade officers (majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels) were casualties— 12 killed or mortally wounded, nine wounded, four wounded and captured, and one captured. All of his brigade commanders [...] fell: Kemper was wounded seriously, captured by Union soldiers, rescued, and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia; Garnett and Armistead were killed. Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge, despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean almost certain death. Armistead, known for leading his brigade with his cap on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sword, made the farthest progress through the Union lines. He was mortally wounded, falling near [...] "The Angle" [...] at {{what is now called}} the High Water Mark of the Confederacy and died two days later in a Union hospital. Ironically, the Union troops that fatally wounded Armistead were under the command of his old friend, Winfield S. Hancock, who was himself severely wounded in the battle. Per his dying wishes, Longstreet delivered Armistead's Bible and other personal effects to Hancock's wife, Almira. Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett's division, the Virginia Military Institute produced 11 and all were casualties—six killed, five wounded.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{himself had}} to ditch {{into the sea}} on 10April, {{when he was shot}} down after being {{surprised}} by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm going to show you how". According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him {{on the night of the}} 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.|$|E
500|$|Six {{days after}} the arrest of Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, just as Turpin and his {{associates}} were returning from Gravesend, Rose, Brazier, and Walker were captured at a chandler's shop in Westminster, while drinking punch.

[...] Walker died while still in Newgate Prison, but the remaining three were hanged at Tyburn gallows on 10March, before their bodies were hung to rot in gibbets on Edgware Road. [...] Walker's body was hung in chains. [...] Two days before the hanging, a report of [...] "four suspicious men" [...] being driven away from an alehouse at East Sheen appeared in a newspaper, and was likely describing Gregory and his companions, but the remaining members of the Essex gang were not reported again until 30March, when three of them (unsuccessfully) tried to steal a horse from a servant of the Earl of Suffolk. [...] Turpin was present with four of the gang at another robbery, reported on 8March. [...] Jasper Gregory meanwhile was captured, and then executed late in March.

500|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{was part}} of an {{offensive}} plan to break through German resistance in northeastern France, as far as Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. In the area of Genevreuille on 15 September 1944, Murphy narrowly escaped death from a mortar shell hit that killed two others and wounded three. Although his resulting heel wound was not serious, he received his first Purple Heart. By this point, all but Murphy and two others of Company B's original group had either been killed or taken off the lines with wounds. General O'Daniel moved the 15th Infantry, 3rd Division to the Moselle and the Cleurie river valley in late September. Stone quarries dotted the hills and provided good defensive positions for the Germans. The 15th was met with fierce resistance north of St. Ame at the heavily fortified multi-tunneled L'Omet quarry. On 2 October at L'Omet, Murphy advanced alone to the location of a machine gun manned by a unit of German soldiers. Within [...] of the machine gun nest, he rose to his feet. [...] "The Germans spot me instantly", he recalled. [...] "The gunner spins <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> weapon toward me. But the barrel catches in a limb, and the burst whizzes to my right". Murphy lobbed two hand grenades at the men, killing four and wounding three. He was awarded the Silver Star for this action. The 15th achieved success in its continued attack when Germans began evacuating the quarry on 5 October. On that date, Murphy, while carrying a SCR-536 radio, advanced alone for [...] towards the Germans while they continually fired directly at him. Around [...] from the Germans' location, he relayed firing orders by radio to the artillery, and remained at his position alone for an hour directing his men. When Murphy's men finally took the hill, 15 German combatants were killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him an Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star.|$|E
