40|$|ABSTRACT: System {{identification}} methodology {{is developed}} for a linear time-periodic (LTP) system {{and applied to}} an experimental setup of an integrally twist-actuated helicopter rotor blade. Identification is conducted for a controller design, which alleviates vibratory loads induced in forward flight. Since a rotor in forward flight is a time-periodic system due to the aerodynamic environment varying once per rotation, the adopted methodology requires determination of the multicomponent harmonic transfer functions. A simplified identification formula is also derived for a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, such as a rotor system in hover. The latter approach gives another estimate of the primary component among the harmonic transfer functions. <b>The</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> conducted at NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The magnitude of the higher-order harmonic transfer functions is observed to be small in the frequency range of interest when {{compared with that of}} the primary component.

Results obtained in system identification are interpreted in terms of the closed-loop controller design.

40|$|Advanced {{process control}} and its {{prevalent}} enabling technology, model predictive control (MPC), can today {{be regarded as}} the industry best practice for optimizing production. The strength of MPC comes from the ability to predict the impact of disturbances and counteract their effects with control actions, and from the ability to account for constraints. These capabilities come from the use of models of the controlled process. However, relying on a model is also a weakness of MPC. The model used by the controller needs to be kept up to date with changing process conditions for good MPC performance. In this thesis, the problem of closed-loop system identification of models intended to be used in MPC is considered. The design of <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiment</b> influences <b>the</b> quality and properties of the estimated model. In the thesis, an application-oriented framework for designing <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> used. <b>The</b> specifics of <b>experiment</b> design for <b>identification</b> of models for MPC are discussed. In particular, including constraints in the controllerresults in a nonlinear control law, which complicates the experiment design. The application-oriented experiment design problem with time-domain constraints is formulated as an optimal control problem, which in general is diffcult to solve. Using Markov decision theory, the <b>experiment</b> design problem <b>is</b> formulated for finite state and action spaces and solved using an extension of existing linear programming techniques for constrained Markov decision processes. The method applies to general noise and disturbance structures but is computationally intensive. Two extensions of MPC with dual control properties which implement the application-oriented <b>experiment</b> design idea <b>are</b> developed. These controllers are limited to output error systems but require less computations. Furthermore, since the controllers are based on a common MPC technique, they can be used as extensions of already available MPC implementations. One of the developed controllers is tested in an extensive experimental validation campaign, which {{is the first time that}} MPC with dual propertiesis applied to a full scale industrial process during regular operation of the plant. Existing <b>experiment</b> design procedures <b>are</b> most often formulated in the frequency domain and the spectrum of the input is used as the design variable. Therefore, a realization of the signal with the right spectrum has to be generated. This is not straightforward for systems operating under constraints. In the thesis, a framework for generating signals, with prespecified spectral properties, that respect system constraints is developed. The framework uses ideas from stochastic MPC and scenario optimization. Convergence to the desired autocorrelation is proved for a special case and the merits of the algorithm are illustrated in a series of simulation examples. QC 20141013 </p...|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} {{for dealing with}} non-linear systems is to describe the system by a model with parameters that vary {{as a function of}} the operating point. Consequently, the non-linear system is seen as a combination of local Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, one for each value of the operating point. Such representations are called Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) models. Due to the importance of this representation for the control of nonlinear systems, numerous algorithms have recently been developed to identify LPV models. However, the optimal design of such <b>identification</b> <b>experiments</b> remains completely unexplored.

A force plate was employed to record the vertical ground reaction force and locate the foot strike time for common sporting motions. Ankle inversion and inversion velocity were calculated by a standard lower extremity biomechanics calculation procedure. Profiles of vertical ground reaction force, ankle inversion angle and ankle inversion velocity were obtained. Results suggested that the ankle was kept in an everted position during the stance. The maximum ankle inversion velocity ranged from 22. 5 to 85. 1 °/s and 114. 0 to 202. 5 °/s for the four tested motions and simulated sprain motion respectively.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Multi-actuator structural testing has traditionally been regarded, from a control point of view, as a multi-loop single-input, single-output problem. This approach {{does not take into}} account the interaction between. different actuators, due to the dynamics of the structure under test, which can be considerable. The result of this is often poor laboratory reproduction of the actual service data. This project shows that the mass of the structure under test has a considerable impact upon the stability of the traditional multi-loop, single-input, single-output control system. Where stability is prejudiced, the loop gains have to be reduced to maintain stability and this can degrade the performance of the test. In these circumstances multivariable control offers the potential for a significant improvement in performance. Two experimental rigs are used in this project, both exhibit major interaction and pose a significant control problem. The first rig consists of a laboratory scale cantilever beam excited by two electro-dynamic vibrators with displacements measured by Linear Variable Differential Transformers (L VDTs). The second, industrial-scale, rig consists of a large steel frame excited by two hydraulic actuators with applied force measured by load cells. Multivariable controllers are designed and implemented on these rigs based on the frequency-domain Characteristic Locus method. The multivariable controllers are shown to demonstrate superior performance to traditional multi-loop controllers. Mathematical models of the rigs are not required for controller design, instead experimental frequency responses are all that are needed. This is a major attraction of the Characteristic Locus method since the task. of modelling the dynamics of a multichannel structural test system is not trivial. However, obtaining the frequency response of the second rig is made difficult by the imposition of closed-loop control during <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiment.</b> A technique <b>is</b> presented to overcome this problem using an existing correlation method...|$|R

From an engineering point of view, MIE will provide the first opportunity to obtain vibration data for the fully-assembled structure because SSF is too large and too flexible to be tested as a single unit on the ground. Such full-system data is essential for validating the analytical model of SSF which would be used in any engineering efforts associated with structural or control system changes that might be made to the station as missions evolve over time. Extensive analytical simulations of on-orbit tests, as well exploratory laboratory simulations using small-scale models, have been conducted in-house and under contract to develop a measurement plan and evaluate its potential performance. In particular, performance trade and parametric studies conducted as part of these simulations were used to resolve issues related to the number and location of the measurements, the type of excitation, data acquisition and data processing, effects of noise and nonlinearities, selection of target vibration modes, and the appropriate type of data analysis scheme. The purpose of this talk is to provide an executive-summary-type overview of <b>the</b> modal <b>identification</b> <b>experiment</b> which has emerged from the conceptual design studies conducted to-date. Emphasis throughout is on those aspects of the <b>experiment</b> which should <b>be</b> of interest to those attending the subject utilization conference. The presentation begins with some preparatory remarks to provide background and motivation for the experiment, describe the experiment in general terms, and cite the specific technical objectives. This is followed by a summary of the major results of the conceptual design studies conducted to define the baseline experiment. The baseline experiment which has resulted from the studies is then described...|$|R
40|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) is a control technique that is frequently {{used in the}} process industry. Two advantages of model {{predictive control}}lers is their ability to predict the impact of disturbances, and to easily account for constraints. However, a disadvantage of model predictive controllers is that they rely on mathematical models of the controlled processes. Changes in process conditions may cause the model to no longer accurately represent the real process, which in turn {{may result in a}} drop in performance. Detecting performance drops and taking subsequent action is thus highly desirable. This thesis aims at assessing current methods that detect and revert these performance drops due to model-plant mismatch. To this end, a benchmark distillation column model representing a typical industrial process was designed. For two different control configurations, models were identified using prediction-error identification, and model-predictive controllers were subsequently designed for reference tracking and rejection of disturbances. Performance of these model-predictive controllers has been compared, and results show that the so called double-ratio configuration is better at disturbance rejection, and shows more robust performance. Further, a performance index that tracks the average variance of the controlled output, computed over a time-range, was developed. A methodology is shown which can be used to compute the optimal time range, when the historic variance, a desired false alarm rate, and threshold is known. In the event a performance drop due to model-plant mismatch is detected, the plant should be re-identified in order to restore nominal performance. This can however be a costly proce- dure. The second part of this thesis therefore focuses on least-costly identification methods. Recently, a new <b>experiment</b> design method <b>was</b> developed that is aimed at minimizing the length of an <b>identification</b> <b>experiment,</b> while constraints on the minimal accuracy of the to-be- identified model and the maximum values of the in- and output signals are honoured Analysis of this new minimal-time algorithm shows that <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiment</b> time can <b>be</b> reduced by up to 56 % when compared with conventional least-costly identification methods. Further, Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed for different initializations and {{it has been shown that}} the minimal-time algorithm manages to find its global minimum for various initial conditions, although the probability to obtain it from an arbitrary simulation is different from system to system. The last part of the thesis discusses the relevance and applicability of performance monitoring and re-identification in practice. While literature assumes tracking the variance of the controlled output is a good indicator, in reality wrong limits on the control inputs, a sub-optimal economic function in the model-predictive controller, and up-time of the model-predictive controllers are more important factors that determine the economic benefits gained from a model predictive control system.

Control performances such as positioning accuracy and maximum velocity strongly {{depend on the}} drive frequency. At first, <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>experiments</b> of <b>the</b> SPIDER with different drive frequency are carried out. Next the gain-scheduled control strategy for the variable frequency control, considering the variation rate of the frequency is introduced. Finally, simulations and <b>experiments</b> <b>are</b> performed in order to verify {{the efficiency of the}} proposed control method. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|R
