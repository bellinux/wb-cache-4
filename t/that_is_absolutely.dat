500|$|Typical HMM-based methods work by {{representing}} an MSA {{as a form}} of directed acyclic graph {{known as}} a partial-order graph, which consists of a series of nodes representing possible entries in the columns of an MSA. In this representation a column <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> conserved (that is, that all the sequences in the MSA share a particular character at a particular position) is coded as a single node with as many outgoing connections as there are possible characters in the next column of the alignment. In the terms of a typical hidden Markov model, the observed states are the individual alignment columns and the [...] "hidden" [...] states represent the presumed ancestral sequence from which the sequences in the query set are hypothesized to have descended. An efficient search variant of the dynamic programming method, known as the Viterbi algorithm, is generally used to successively align the growing MSA to the next sequence in the query set to produce a new MSA. This is distinct from progressive alignment methods because the alignment of prior sequences is updated at each new sequence addition. However, like progressive methods, this technique can be influenced by the order in which the sequences in the query set are integrated into the alignment, especially when the sequences are distantly related.|$|E

[...] In an interview, Josh Sawyer said that being free of the limitations of a publisher would enable them to [...] "delve into more mature subject matter slavery, hostile prejudice (racial, cultural, spiritual, sexual), drug use and trade, and so on will all help flesh out the story". Obsidian was said to be inspired by InXile Entertainment's success of using Kickstarter to fund Wasteland 2. Chris Avellone said during the project's announcement that if the campaign were to succeed, Pillars of Eternity would become a franchise. He also ruled out a possible console port of the game, saying, [...] "Those [...] limitations affect RPG mechanics and content more than players may realize (especially for players who've never played a PC RPG and realize what's been lost over the years), and often doesn't add to the RPG experience." [...] Nevertheless, the game was successfully ported to consoles later. Additionally, he has pledged to write a novella set in the game world.|$|E
