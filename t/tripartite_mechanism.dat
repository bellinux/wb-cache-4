40|$|Many neurons of {{all animals}} that exhibit memory (snails, worms, flies, vertebrae) present arborized shapes with many varicosities and boutons. These neurons, release neurotransmitters and contain ionotropic receptors that produce and sense {{electrical}} signals (ephaptic transmission). The extended shapes maximize neural {{contact with the}} surrounding neutrix (neural extracellular matrix (nECM) + diffusible (neurometals and neurotransmitters) {{as well as with}} other neurons. We propose a <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanism</b> of animal memory based on the dynamic interactions of splayed neurons with the neutrix. Their interactions form cognitive units of information (cuinfo), metal-centered complexes within the nECM around the neuron. Emotive content is provided by NTs, which embody molecular links between physiologic (body) responses and psychic feelings. We propose that neurotransmitters form mixed complexes with cuinfo used for tagging emotive memory. Thus, NTs provide encoding option not available to a Turing, binary-based, device. The neurons employ combinatorially diverse options, with > 10 NMs and > 90 NTs for encoding (flavoring) cuinfo with emotive tags. The neural network efficiently encodes, decodes and consolidates related (entangled) sets of cuinfo into a coherent pattern, the basis for emotionally imbued memory, critical for determining a behavioral choice aimed at survival. The <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanism</b> with tagging of NTs permits of a causal connection between physiology and psychology. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In {{a system}} of {{tripartite}} consultation, workers, employers, and the government work together to improve labor standards and protect workers’ rights. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has advocated for this system {{since its founding in}} 1919. China’s transition toward a market economy and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession calls for a new labor relations consultation mechanism, which is more market‐oriented, globalized, diversified, and flexible. In this context, China implemented its own form of tripartite consulta‐ tion in 2001, with the founding of the State Labor Relations Tripartite   Consultation Conference.   The tripartite system in China has been widely adopted and has been an innovative development in Chinese labor relations. However, many argue that it does not meet the standards of the ILO tripartite system. Indeed, China’s tripartite consultation mechanism differs from that advocated by the ILO. The tripartite consultation mechanism in China lacks neutrality, enforceability of consultation outcomes, trade union independence and workers’ representation. Nonetheless, the <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanism</b> currently utilized in Chinese labor relations is a first step toward a more authentic tripartite   consultation mechanism by ILO standards.

40|$|The link {{of memory}} to {{intelligence}} is incontestable, though {{the development of}} electronic artifacts with memory has confounded cognitive and computer scientists’ conception of memory and its relevance to “intelligence”. We propose two categories of “Intelligence”: (1) Logical (objective) — mathematics, numbers, pattern recognition, games, programmable in binary format. (2) Emotive (subjective) — sensations, feelings, perceptions, goals desires, sociability, sex, food, love. The 1 st {{has been reduced to}} computational algorithms of which we are well versed, witness global technology and the internet. The 2 nd relates to the mysterious process whereby (psychic) emotive states are achieved by neural beings sensing, comprehending, remembering and dealing with their surroundings. Many theories and philosophies have been forwarded to rationalize this process, but as neuroscientists, we remain dissatisfied. Our own musings on universal neural memory, suggest a <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanism</b> involving neurons interacting with their surroundings, notably the neural extracellular matrix (nECM) with dopants [trace metals and neurotransmitters (NTs) ]. In particular, the NTs are the molecular encoders of emotive states. We have developed a chemographic representation of such a molecular code. To quote Longuet-Higgins, “ Perhaps {{it is time for the}} term ‘artificial intelligence’ to be replaced by something more modest and less provisional ”. We suggest “artifact intelligence” (ARTI) or “machine intelligence” (MI), neither of which imply emulation of emotive neural processes, but simply refer to the ‘demotive’ (lacking emotive quality) capability of electronic artifacts that employ a recall function, to calculate algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Responding to {{internal}} market and social pressures that centre on the inadequate protection accorded to workers' rights, China's government has begun constructing a tripartite industrial relations regime.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to document {{changes in the}} wage levels of different categories of workers employed in various segments of the labour market during the period 1990 - 91 – 2006 - 07, according to the information given in the labour force surveys. Wage structure can be analysed from different angles. Here {{we look at the}} levels and trends in the broad categories of industry. Further subdivided along the demarcation of formal/informal, and by worker characteristics such as age, sex, education, and occupational categories. Largescale Manufacturing Industries, Banking Sector, and Civil Servants’ salary structure are subjected to investigation for disuring wage trends in the formal sector. The impact of unionism and of the labour and wage policies of various regimes and upon wage outcome is also assessed. There appears to be a consonance between money wage growth at the aggregate level of the economy and GDP growth. The former registered a positive growth, {{with the exception of the}} 1999 - 2002 period, when the latter had low growth. Time trend of average wage works out to 7. 6 percent, which, adjusted for inflation, yields a 0. 7 percent trend growth rate in real wages for the 1990 - 07 period. Real wage growth rate at the aggregative level is characterised by substantial diversity. One finds an inverse relationship between the level of wage rate and real wage growth. Thus workers in the informal sector and commodity producing sectors like Agriculture and Manufacturing suffered a real wage decline during the period under study. That the real wage gains were denied to the majority of the workers (60 percent or so) lying at the lower rung of the wage distribution rendered the wage structure iniquitous wherein duality further accentuated. The character of the regime tends to have its mark. During the 1990 s, the political leadership notwithstanding, low GDP growth and Pressler Amendment appeared to have sympathetic attitude towards labour, which was visible in the virulence of trade unions as well as announcement of the Minimum Wage Policy during early 1990 s. However, in the context of labour supply pressure and subdued economic performance, stagnation and decline in real wage could not be avoided. In contrast, there hardly has been any sizeable positive impact on the real wages of the informal sector workers since the turnaround of the economy in 2003. The governmental attitude was reflective of the follow-up of the imperatives of globalisation, weakening of trade unions, and introduction of the changes in the procedures governing the <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanism</b> and formulation of labour and wage policy. The need to have a fresh look at the labour and wage policy to ensure sustenance and to address inequality issues can hardly be overemphasised. Wages; Wage Structure; Pakistan...|$|E

40|$|The {{parasite}} Cryptosporidium parvum {{has three}} 14 - 3 - 3 proteins: Cp 14 e, Cp 14 a and Cp 14 b, with only Cp 14 e similar to human 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in sequence, peptide-binding properties and structure. Structurally, Cp 14 a features the classical 14 - 3 - 3 dimer {{but with a}} uniquely wide pocket and a disoriented RRY triad potentially incapable of binding phosphopeptides. The Cp 14 b protein deviates from the norm significantly: (i) In one subunit, the phosphorylated C-terminal tail is bound in the binding groove like a phosphopeptide. This supports our binding study indicating this protein was stabilized by a peptide mimicking its last six residues. (ii) The other subunit has eight helices instead of nine, with aA and aB forming a single helix and occluding the peptide-binding cleft.

In September 2004, the city of Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, established the Xi’an Domestic Workers Trade, subordinate to the Xi’an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Re-employment Services Centre for Laid-off Workers (later renamed Domestic Services Centre). The members of the union were female laid-off workers engaged in domestic service work. This is the only municipal-level trade union in the entire country. Around the year 2000, the Xi’an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Re-employment Services Centre for Laid-off Workers mobilized and arranged domestic service jobs for more than 12, 000 female laid-off workers. These workers had experience working in state-owned enterprises, and they demanded establishing their own union organizations in order to settle potential labour disputes between domestic workers and their employers. After it was established, the union set up an arbitration commission to carry out mediation on related issues. As a trade union, it implemented a <b>tripartite</b> negotiation <b>mechanism</b> consisting of the municipal-level domestic services workers’ union plus domestic workers associations plus client representatives, and on the foundation of collective negotiations tabled the “Domestic Services Regulations.” The survey found that the domestic services union’s participation rate was limited, with 182 members in 2004, all of them laid-off domestic service workers over 40, of whom about 70 % were the heads of one-parent families. The largest number of members the union ever had was around 1, 500.

40|$|Namibia {{does not}} {{represent}} a case of structural adjustment, that is, a kind of economic reform {{in a situation of}} crisis with a high leverage of external actors (IMF, World Bank). Rather, the agenda for economic reform is set by the government, and addresses the problems of the high poverty and extreme inequality of a dualistic economy which emanate from a mineral-based enclave economy and from a past policy of racial segregation (apartheid), which restricted the benefits of education and other social services to the privileged. Government policy is aimed at promoting growth and employment and reducing poverty and inequality. Key instruments for achieving these aims are high expenditures on education, health, a universal pension system, and other social services. Further to this, measures have been taken to create employment and to redress inequities on the labour market. At the same time, the Namibian Government follows a market-oriented and open economic policy, based on acknowledgement {{of the fact that the}} problems of poverty and inequality can only be overcome in the context of economic growth. The aims of the government include a balanced budget, a conservative approach to foreign debt, and public sector reform. However, progress in the achievement of these remains limited. Namibia’s economic record since independence in 1990 compares favourably to both the pre-independence decade and the sub-Saharan African (SSA) average, but remains inadequate to the task of significantly raising per capita incomes - in fact, since 1994 per capita incomes have been stagnating. Independent Namibia inherited a highly segmented labour market, where every defined ‘ethnic group’ had differentiated access to employment and to wages, with a major underlying factor being unequal access to education. Figures do not exist for tracing the record in social development precisely, but it is clear that poverty and inequality remain a major problem. Unemployment has increased, as the declining importance of agricultural employment has not been compensated by commensurate increases in employment in the industrial and services sectors. Namibia’s formal sector is characterised by its large size and high incomes. Sheltered by the high tariffs of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), these are increasing and outstripping productivity increases. They also reflect the high degree of unionisation and the scarcity of skills. Then there are the small non-agricultural informal sector and agriculture, with low, market-determined incomes. Poverty is concentrated among the rural population (subsistence farmers, agricultural and other workers). Significant progress has been made when one compares the present to the inequitable situation of the past. However, despite high expenditures in the social sectors, the outcome remains limited, due to inefficiencies. Confrontational labour relations were inherited and have not yet been overcome, despite a policy of reconciliation and collective bargaining, and are identified as a key problem by investors. A related problem is that the trade unions represent mainly the predominantly non-poor urban workers and employees. The involvement of labour market institutions in the process of economic reform is limited, due to two principal factors. Firstly, the institutions do not yet represent the social partners in their totality, and secondly, this capacity of economic policy analysis is itself limited. Measures to augment the role of social partners in the formulation of economic policy reform include the following: • strengthening the voice of presently underrepresented groups (low-paid workers, especially in the informal sector; informal sector operators) • strengthening the capacity of the social partners in economic policy analysis • strengthening institutionalised <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanisms</b> • providing better information to the general public (e. g. capacity- building of economic policy journalists) • providing timely and comprehensive economic information (statistics) to facilitate an informed debate).

40|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} (NPOs) 1 {{have become}} a key provider of public services (Kelly, 2007). In recent years, however, {{the environment in which}} NPOs operate has become increasingly challenging due to a number of factors, including an increase in uncertainty over government funding policy (Akingbola, 2004, Anheier, 2009), an intensification in rivalry between NPOs (Chew and Osborne, 2009), and a lack of employee commitment (Kong, 2008). Osborne et al. (2012) have found that in response to such challenges NPOs are, for instance, re-engineering their operations to reduce overhead costs, achieving economies of scale through merging with counterparts, emphasizing the leadership role of trustees, and replacing government funding with new and untraditional streams of income. This chapter concerns the latter in regard to nonprofit business collaboration (NBC), specifically how and under what conditions NPOs can collaborate with businesses to support their organizational sustainability. As a strategic option for NPOs, this aspect of NBC inquiry has been largely overlooked (Al-Tabbaa et al., 2014, Cantrell et al., 2008, Harris, 2012). The chapter is organized into three principal sections. In the first, we review the NBC literature and present the concept of NBC as a <b>tripartite</b> value-creation <b>mechanism.</b> Importantly, we use this review to identify a salient gap in the nonprofit and NBC literatures: NBC {{from the perspective of the}} NPO. In addressing this gap, the second section introduces a conceptual framework that we developed to assist NPOs in developing and operationalizing an NBC strategy. The framework is based on the three elements of strategy: context (the environment in which an organization operates), content (the choices to achieve the strategy purpose) and process (the formulation and implementation of the chosen strategy) (Pettigrew, 1985, Pettigrew and Whipp, 1991). However, using this concept of strategy to study public services providers (e. g., NPOs) can be criticized due to its manufacturing origins (Beck et al., 2008, Dart, 2004). Therefore, we review the service management approach (Osborne et al., 2013, Osborne, 2009, Thomas, 2012) to demonstrate how our framework, and it theoretical foundation, is still relevant to NPOs, thus enhancing its validity. We conclude the chapter with an evaluation of NBC-related risks and threats to NPOs and consider implications for future research and practice...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates both {{substantive}} {{and procedural}} issues pertaining to allegations of {{crimes committed by}} UN peacekeepers in three African countries, Somalia, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Under the current UN Model Status-of-Forces Agreements, criminal jurisdiction over peacekeepers rests with their sending States. However, although the UN has no criminal jurisdiction, {{it has been the}} Office of Internal Oversight Services that has conducted investigations. It is argued that every Status of Force Agreement and every Memorandum of Understanding should contain specific clauses obligating Troop-Contributing Countries to prosecute and the UN to follow-up. If rape, murder, assault, and any other crimes by UN peacekeepers go unpunished, the message sent to the victims is that peacekeepers are above the law. Rape is the most commonly committed crime by peacekeepers, but is usually considered as an isolated act. The procedural issue of prosecuting peacekeepers is investigated in order to establish whether troops can be caught under the ambits of the criminal law of the Host State to hold UN troops criminally accountable for their acts. The laws relative to the elements of each crime and the possible available defences under the three Host States, and the criminal law of South Africa as a Troop-Contributing Country, are discussed. The apparent lack of prosecution is investigated and existing cases of prosecution discussed. Alternatives to the unwillingness by States with criminal jurisdiction under the Status of Forces Agreement or under the Memorandum of Understanding are considered. Considering the current rules related to crimes committed by peacekeepers, the argument put forward is that crimes by peacekeepers must be dealt with completely and transparently though a Convention aiming at barring Troop-Contributing Countries who do not meet their obligations under international law from participating in future operations of peace. This thesis, furthermore, suggests a <b>tripartite</b> court <b>mechanism</b> to fill the lacunae in the law relating to the prosecution of peacekeepers. It considers the issues of reserving jurisdiction over peacekeepers to the Troop-Contributing Countries which are reluctant to prosecute repatriated alleged perpetrators. The victims’ importance in criminal proceedings and their their right to a remedy are highlighted. Criminal and Procedural LawLL. D...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesMember {{countries}} of multilateral and regional organisations have progressively negotiated tariff preferences and achieved tariff reductions on substantial trade. However, a tendency of policy reversal has been witnessed due to non-tariff barriers (NTBs) being imposed to control trade and recoup losses arising from reduced duties. To address {{the proliferation of}} NTBs, multilateral and regional organisations are implementing various forms of NTB notification, reporting, monitoring and eliminating mechanisms. The broad objectives {{of this study is}} to evaluate the performance of the tripartite NTBs reporting, monitoring and eliminating mechanism against best practice and establish its effectiveness to remove NTBs in the tripartite region. The main aim is to identify challenges and gaps in the design of the mechanism that are critical to the effective management of NTBs. Existing literature on mechanisms to address NTBs was reviewed. The focus of which was the main elements of reporting, monitoring and resolution of NTBs through the online mechanism. Policies dealing with NTBs were identified. The short comings of the <b>tripartite</b> online NTB <b>mechanism</b> (NTB-RMM) particularly with regards to data inadequacies, poor categorisation which impact negatively on NTB monitoring and policy improvements in the tripartite countries were also identified from literature. The online mechanism, hosted on the website www. tradebarriers. org was the primary source of the information and data utilised for analysis in this study. Supplementary information was obtained from the actual responses from a target group using questionnaires and interviews. Data analysis was done by aggregating and assessing results from the data extracted from the mechanism, responses from questionnaire, available literature, findings from the desk research and oral and telephonic interviews. Evidence from literature indicated that there are basically two types of NTB mechanisms implemented at multilateral, regional and national levels. These are web and non-web based notification and reporting mechanisms. The mechanisms designed by the WTO, EU and OECD are notification mechanisms whereas the mechanisms implemented by other organisations like ECOWAS, COMESA, EAC and SADC are reporting mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Anthony Forsyth {{proposes a}} social {{partnership}} agenda for Australia WHAT kind of labour law or industrial relations system should replace Work Choices? This might seem an odd question - after all, {{the new legislation}} has only been in operation for a little over six months. But the Work Choices Act is widely {{considered to be a}} partisan piece of legislation - one that provides too much scope for the untrammeled exercise of managerial power. It is also heavily oriented towards conflict - especially in the bargaining sphere, where the statute sets up a complex, legalistic process for parties to engage in “industrial warfare,” without any effective mechanism for dispute resolution. In his recent Julian Small Lecture (PDF), Professor Ron McCallum speculated that Work Choices will not stand the test of time. In his view, it will be substantially revised within six to eight years, for several reasons, including the failure of many employers to engage with the new laws - for example, because they want to treat their employees fairly (rather than engaging in the labour cost-cutting that is now open to them) or they want to avoid its complexity. Clearly, the outcome of the next federal election will be critical in determining the longevity of the reforms. If the Coalition is re-elected, then Work Choices will probably have a minimum “life” of five years or so. On the other hand, if Labor wins the election, that will {{be the end of the}} Work Choices experiment. But apart from the ALP’s commitment to “rip up these unfair laws,” scrap AWAs, and introduce a firmer basis for collective bargaining, we do not really know what they will put in the place of Work Choices. So with the federal election only twelve months away (maybe less), it is not at all premature to be considering “what next, after Work Choices?” I want to suggest that the central concept underpinning any new industrial relations system should be that of “social partnership. ” I also want to briefly outline a couple of key elements of a system based on that concept. Social partnership is a continental European notion. It essentially denotes the idea of cooperation between government, unions and employers, rather than adversarialism, as the basis for ordering labour relations. In its purest form, for example in Germany, these cooperative arrangements operate at three mutually reinforcing levels: 1. At the national, policy formulation level - through <b>tripartite</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for determining the framework of labour regulation and economic policy (Australia had some experience of this in the Accord years) 2. At the industry or sectoral level - through collective bargaining between unions and employer associations, which sets the parameters for workplace-level outcomes regarding wages, working hours, and other core employment conditions 3. At the firm level - the legal rights of workers to participate in workplace decision-making through works councils, and employee representation on the boards of larger companies. Obviously, Australia cannot simply replicate the German (or any other European) industrial relations system. We have to bear in mind that their systems operate within specific institutional and economic contexts that support the social partnership approach - such as the European “social market economy,” and “stakeholder” rather than shareholder-centred corporate governance systems. However, we can borrow the underlying concept - that of partnership, or cooperation in industrial relations - and, by giving it a modern Australian flavour, use it as a basis for developing an alternative workplace relations framework. In this respect, recent experience in New Zealand points the way. New Zealand has a remarkably similar industrial relations heritage to Australia: a long-standing conciliation and arbitration system that provided strong support to trade unions, but which gave way to a deregulated model centred on individualised bargaining. When Labour was re-elected to government in NZ in 1999 it was faced with similar questions to those confronting the ALP now; with a return to conciliation and arbitration no longer viable, how could the new government legislate for a fair and balanced employment relations system to protect workers’ interests and meet the needs of a modern economy? The settlement arrived at in New Zealand’s Employment Relations Act 2000 is founded on the concept of “good faith,” which permeates all aspects of individual employment relationships, and collective labour relations, which are regulated by the legislation. For example, the 2000 legislation provides a framework of “good faith bargaining” rights and duties, applicable to employers, employees and unions, as well as consultation rights for workers over company restructuring at the firm level. The strong statutory support for “good faith” employment relations is intended to facilitate a broader cultural shift in NZ towards “workplace partnership,” which is defined as “an active relationship between unions & employers to deliver outcomes that benefit the mutual trust of both parties. ” The core ideas behind partnership include: a collaborative, “mutual gains” approach to bargaining; wide union and employee consultation practices; consensus over conflict; and restraint and protection of relationships in the management of conflict. This approach is supported by various government organisations and processes operating at the national level, including the Growth and Innovation Framework, the tripartite Workplace Productivity Project, and the Partnership Resource Centre. Overall, through these inter-linked layers of innovative regulation, the Labour government has really engineered a NZ version of the European social partnership model. I think we need a public policy conversation in Australia about establishing an IR system based on cooperation, not conflict. That debate should involve all of the “social partners” in the Australian context - for example, federal and state governments, employer bodies, unions, and welfare, church and community groups. And, in my view, there are two key elements that need to form part of an Australian social partnership agenda: 1. “Good faith bargaining”: We must rectify the current legislative anomaly, where we have around 100 pages of rules regarding protected industrial action, secret ballots, etc - but nothing preserving the right of a group of workers to obtain a collective agreement if they want one; nothing about the bargaining process; and little opportunity for resolving bargaining impasses (except in the most extreme cases). The ACTU is leading the way here. Its recent collective bargaining proposals seek to bring Australia into line with other major industrialised economies, such as the UK, US, Canada - all of which provide in some way for a right to collective bargaining, where this is supported by a majority of the workforce. The ACTU has sensibly steered clear of mandatory employee ballots and other complex legal procedures that are features of some overseas IR systems, drawing in part on NZ’s good faith bargaining model. It also seeks to restore a prominent role for the AIRC, as the body for determining whether a union has met the “majority support” requirement for triggering the bargaining process, overseeing that process and resolving deadlocks. 2. Participation in workplace decision-making: Employees in the modern workforce should be involved in strategic business decisions, and provided with the information they need to do so, including information about firm performance, future investment plans, and restructuring proposals. Much international evidence shows that this kind of “high consultation/high performance” approach leads to productive outcomes for firms, as well as providing workers with a “voice” over important issues of job security. In Australia, these objectives could be achieved through a combination of statutory mandate - for example, information & consultation rights for employees in larger businesses - supplemented by a range of regulatory supports (provided by federal and state governments) to enable firms to pursue the cooperative path to workplace innovation and business competitiveness - for example, information, training, funding trials, tax breaks and other incentives. These ideas might seem a world away from the current reality of Work Choices. But they are being successfully implemented, in various forms, in several countries that share Australia’s tradition of adversarial IR, including (as well as New Zealand) the United Kingdom and Ireland. As in those countries, any move to embrace workplace partnership will require a major cultural shift in Australia - greater levels of trust by managers in their workers, and a degree of compromise on the part of employees and their representatives. The idea of social partnership warrants serious consideration in any process of formulating alternative proposals for labour regulation in Australia. • Anthony Forsyth is senior lecturer and director of the Corporate Law and Accountability Research Group, Department of Business Law & Taxation, Monash University, and an associate of the Australian Institute of Employment Rights.
