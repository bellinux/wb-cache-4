In a large hospital, a pathologist typically handles 100 grading cases per day, each consisting of about 2000 image frames. It is, therefore, a very tedious and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a method for automatic computer grading to assist pathologists by providing second opinions and reducing their workload. It combines the three criteria in the Nottingham scoring system using a multi-resolution approach. To our best knowledge, there is no existing work <b>that</b> <b>provide</b> complete <b>grading</b> according to the Nottingham criteria. I...|$|R

40|$|Implantable defibrillators {{reduce the}} risk of sudden death in {{patients}} with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, but significant restriction in quality of life can occur as a result of frequent device activation. To determine if a device <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> both antitachy-cardia pacing and shock therapy can safely reduce the frequency of shocks after implantation, 46 consecutive patients undergoing initial implantation of a defibrillator were studied. In all patients, the implanted device provided antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy. Detected tachycardia characteristics and the results of therapy were stored in the device's memory. There were 42 men and 4 women, aged 26 to 71 years (mean 58. 7 ± 13. 5). Left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 13 % to 67 % (mean 32. 2 ± 13. 4 %) and 31 patients had experienced one or more episodes of cardiac arrest. Induced arrhythmias included sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 38 patients, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 2 and ventricular fibrillation in 4. Over a total follow-up period of 255 patient-months (range 1 to 13, mean 6. 1), 25 patients experienced spontaneous arrhythmic events. In 22 patients, 909 episodes of tachycardia were treated by antitachycardia pacing, which was successful on 840 occasions (92. 4 %). Acceleration of ventricular tachycardia by pacing therapy was estimated to have occurred 39 times. Syncope occurred once during pacing-induced acceleration of ventricular tachycardia. Forty-four episodes of tachycardia in seven patients were treated directly by shocks because of short tachycardia cycle length; 88 % of all detected tachycardias were treated without the need for shocks. Four patients died from cardiorespiratory failure and one patient died suddenly without any detected tachyarrhythmia. These initial results demonstrate that a device <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>graded</b> therapy with antitachycardia pacing for ventricular arrhythmias reduces the need for high energy shocks and rarely results in detrimental delays in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia...|$|R

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: The long- established conventional reference technique (CRT) for measuring respiratory mechanics in horses lacks sensitivity {{and there is}} a need for further refinement in new technology, such as the impulse oscillometry system (IOS). Objectives: To evaluate the potential use of the IOS as a clinical respiratory function test and compare it to the current CRT in horses suffering from common upper and lower airway dysfunctions. Methods: Six healthy horses were tested before and after induction of a unilateral nasal obstruction (UNO) or transient left laryngeal hemiplegia. (LLH). Six heaves-affected horses were tested in clinical remission and during a heaves crisis, before and after nebulisation of cumulative doses of a bronchodilator therapy (ipratropium bromide; IPB). Results: As opposed to the CRT, the IOS was able to detect partial upper airway obstruction (UAO) caused by UNO or LLH in resting horses, without differentiating both conditions. Upper airway obstruction caused an upward shift of resistance (R-rs) from 5 to 35 Hz without altering reactance (X-rs). As for the CRT, IOS respiratory parameters measured in heaves-affected horses in crisis differed significantly from values measured during remission. The difference in frequency-dependent behaviour of R-rs and X-rs allowed discrimination between upper and lower airway obstructions. Bronchodilator treatment induced significant dose-dependent changes in X-rs at 5 and 10 Hz, from the first dose. Total pulmonary resistance (R-L) and R-rs at 5 Hz were affected from the second dose and displayed similar sensitivity. Although post treatment R-L values were comparable to remission, R-rs and X-rs remained significantly different, characterising persistent peripheral obstruction. Conclusions: The IOS was more sensitive than the CRT in detecting partial UAO in resting horses and persistent post treatment peripheral dysfunction in heaves-affected horses. The IOS is a sensitive test <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>graded</b> quantitative and qualitative information on disease-induced respiratory dysfunctions as well as on treatment efficiency in horses. Potential relevance: The IOS could represent a practical and sensitive alternative respiratory function test for routine clinical investigations of common airway obstructive diseases and therapy in horses.

However, recess has the potential to offer significant academic, physical, and social benefits. These benefits have led to a vigorous and ongoing debate about the importance of recess in {{elementary schools}} (Ramstetter et al., 2010). Therefore, this study examined the effect of recess on students’ time on-task in a fifth grade classroom. There were 12 participants in the study, six male and six female students. All participants were in the same fifth grade classroom at the same elementary school. Twelve observations were completed from September 12, 2016 - October 19, 2016 on Mondays and Wednesdays. Two 30 -minute observations were completed each day. One 30 -minute observation was immediately before recess and the other 30 -minute observation immediately followed recess. Participants’ on-task and/or off-task behaviors were documented in 5 -minute intervals throughout each 30 -minute observation to determine if recess increased or decreased time on-task.

40|$|ABSTRACT Good {{guidelines}} {{will help}} us to take evidence into practice. In a survey among Dutch orthopedic surgeons, {{development and use of}} evidence-based guidelines was perceived {{as one of the best}} ways of moving from opinion-based to evidence-based orthopedic practice. The increasing number of guidelines means that knowing how to make a critical appraisal of guidelines is now a key part of every surgeon’s life. This is particularly true because guidelines use varying systems to judge the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. In this manuscript we discuss what a guideline is, where we can find guidelines, how to evaluate the quality of guidelines, and finally provide an example on the different steps of guideline development. Thus, we show that good guidelines are a summary of the best available evidence and <b>that</b> they <b>provide</b> a <b>graded</b> recommendation to help surgeons in evidence-based practice...|$|R
