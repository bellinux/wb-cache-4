50|$|The {{majority}} of available instruments vent their specimen chamber to the ambient pressure (100 kPa) with every specimen transfer. A {{large volume of}} gas has to be pumped out and replaced with the gas of interest, usually water vapor supplied from a water reservoir connected to the chamber via some pressure regulating (e.g. needle) valve. In many applications this presents no problem, but with those ones requiring uninterrupted 100% relative humidity, {{it has been found}} that the removal of ambient gas is accompanied by lowering the relative humidity below the 100% level during specimen transfer. This clearly defeats the very purpose of ESEM for this class of applications. However, such a problem does not arise with the original prototype ESEM using an intermediate specimen <b>transfer</b> <b>chamber,</b> so that the main chamber is always maintained at 100% relative humidity without interruption during a study. The specimen <b>transfer</b> <b>chamber</b> (tr-ch) shown in the diagram of ESEM gas pressure stages contains a small water reservoir so that the initial ambient air can be quickly pumped out and practically instantaneously replaced with water vapor without going through a limited conductance tube and valve. The main specimen chamber can be maintained at 100% relative humidity, if the only leak of vapor is through the small PLA1, but not during violent pumping with every specimen change. Once the wet specimen is in equilibrium with 100% relative humidity in the <b>transfer</b> <b>chamber,</b> within seconds, a gate valve opens and the specimen is transferred in the main specimen chamber maintained at the same pressure. An alternative approach involving controlled pumping of the main chamber may not solve the problem entirely either because the 100% relative humidity cannot be approached monotonically without any drying, or the process is very slow; inclusion of a water reservoir inside the main chamber means that one cannot lower the relative humidity until after all of the water is pumped out (i.e. a defective control of the relative humidity).|$|E

40|$|Determination of {{the rate}} of energy loss in a {{reverberation}} chamber is fundamental to many different measurements such as absorption cross-section, antenna efficiency, radiated power, and shielding effectiveness. Determination of the energy decay time-constant in the time domain by linear fitting the power delay profile, rather than using the frequency domain quality-factor, {{has the advantage of}} being independent of the radiation efficiency of antennas used in the measurement. However, determination of chamber time constant by linear regression suffers from several practical problems, including a requirement for long measurement times.
