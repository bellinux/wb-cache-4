Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E

5|$|In 1385 Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania {{agreed to}} marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland in the Union of Kreva. Jogaila {{converted}} to Christianity and was crowned as the King of Poland (Władysław II Jagiełło), thus creating a personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The official Lithuanian conversion to Christianity removed the religious {{rationale for the}} order's activities in the area. Its grand master, Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein, supported by the Hungarian king, Sigismund of Luxemburg, responded by publicly contesting <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of Jogaila's conversion, bringing the charge to a papal court. The territorial disputes continued over Samogitia, which had been in Teutonic hands since the Peace of Raciąż in 1404. Poland also had territorial claims against the Knights in Dobrzyń Land and Gdańsk (Danzig), but the two states had been largely at peace since the Treaty of Kalisz (1343). The conflict was also motivated by trade considerations: The knights controlled the lower reaches of the three largest rivers (the Neman, Vistula and Daugava) in Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|The {{monument}} {{has been}} the subject of controversy. In Ziółkowski's vision, the sculpted likeness of Crazy Horse is dedicated to the spirit of Crazy Horse and all Native Americans. It is well-known that Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the intended meaning of the memorial. Opponents of the monument have likened it to pollution and desecration of the landscape and environment of the Black Hills, and of the ideals of Crazy Horse himself.|$|E
5000|$|In Russia, <b>the</b> term new <b>sincerity</b> (novaya iskrennost) {{was used}} {{as early as the}} mid-1980s or early 1990s by {{dissident}} poet Dmitry Prigov and critic Mikhail Epstein, {{as a response to the}} dominant sense of absurdity in late Soviet and post-Soviet culture. In Epstein's words, [...] "Postconceptualism, or <b>the</b> New <b>Sincerity,</b> is an experiment in resuscitating [...] "fallen", dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm.|$|R
60|$|Several things helped it amazingly.

25|$|On 11 November 2013, former American {{ambassador}} to Bulgaria James Pardew {{was allowed to}} enter the premises of the occupied Sofia University. This raised eyebrows among the students opposed to the occupation, who demanded an explanation given that access had been denied to university administrators, academics and students not in favour of the occupiers' approach. The main spokesman for the occupying students Ivaylo Dinev claims that Pardew was not permitted to go inside the university building by student security (as the students were not fully convinced in <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of his motives), but did speak to three of the student representatives inside the university premises.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{officers}} enlisted from the merchant Navy felt insulted by the perceived arrogance of their comrades, and were suspicious as to <b>the</b> <b>sincerity</b> of their {{allegiance to the}} Republic. Captain Coëtnempren would be arrested and eventually sent to the guillotine upon a denunciation by a junior officer who accused him from withholding his advancement {{because he was a}} commoner from the merchant navy. Due to the desertions of high-ranking officers of noble extraction or Royalist convictions, these merchant officers were promoted very quickly to fill the ranks; this both transformed the social composition of naval staff, and promoted officers of little experience to command positions.|$|E
25|$|While {{those early}} {{processes}} continued locally international attention shifted to Africa for Bahá'ís in the West and East.

40|$|This project explores <b>the</b> {{qualities of}} <b>sincerity,</b> authenticity, and irony in Jack Kerouac 2 ̆ 7 s novel On the Road. The thesis asserts that that On the Road is neither ironic nor authentic, but, rather, that it both {{possesses}} aspects of traditional <b>sincerity</b> and anticipates <b>the</b> New <b>Sincerity</b> movement in contemporary literature. Through observing {{the characteristics of}} traditional sincerity and New <b>Sincerity</b> in <b>the</b> novel, the thesis amends the novel 2 ̆ 7 s critical position by showing a level of complexity, foresight, and nuance in the text. Ultimately, the thesis shows Kerouac 2 ̆ 7 s response to modern reality, presenting the limitations of authenticity and irony while esteeming <b>the</b> power of <b>sincerity...</b>|$|R
