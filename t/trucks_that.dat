5|$|In 2008 historians Brendan O'Carroll (New Zealand), Guno Goss (Switzerland) and Roberto Chiavetto (Italy) {{travelled}} to Libya {{to track}} down three LRDG <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> had been abandoned in 1941 at Gebel Sherif, in Southern Libya, after the LRDG's first encounter with their Italian equivalent, the Autosahariana. This 65 minute documentary traced their journey, and includes never before seen archival film of the LRDG in action. It was first aired on ANZAC day, 25 April 2009 on Television New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{portion of}} NY117 in Katonah {{passed through a}} {{historic}} district containing several homes {{dating back to the}} late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of NY117 became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along NY117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have provided an alternate route to I-684 from NY117, commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> used NY117 would shake the historic homes as it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along NY117 in Katonah began in 1976 {{at the request of the}} town of Bedford.|$|E

25|$|From early 2010, Ports of Auckland has {{operated}} a new inland port / rail siding in Wiri to connect road freight {{to the port}} facilities via freight trains.

25|$|Soakaway latrines, {{which are}} common in rural areas, often do not work {{properly}} due to the high groundwater table, infrequent emptying and cracks in the walls. Thus sewage leaks out and contaminates the surrounding streets, canals, and groundwater. <b>Trucks</b> <b>that</b> empty latrines and septic tanks do not necessarily discharge septage into wastewater treatment plants, but rather dump the content in the environment.|$|E

25|$|The Transportation Department of the City of Durham {{maintains}} Gregson Street, {{which runs}} under the bridge. The city installed height detectors on Gregson a block before the bridge. When an over-height truck passes by the detector, yellow warning lights flash {{to alert the}} drivers of <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> will not clear the low underpass. Unfortunately, many drivers fail to heed the warnings, and crash into the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{mindful of}} {{environmental}} issues that were key elements in the 1985 cancellation of the Westway project, the New York City Industrial Development Agency commissioned an environmental assessment. This assessment found that immersed tube construction would be environmentally more hazardous and more expensive than bored tunnel construction. Ventilation was confirmed as practical and found unlikely to present greater hazards than fumes from <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> would otherwise be used to transport freight.|$|E

Biodegradable wastes in this area are converted to fertilizers. In 2004, the city government funded the repair of 29 garbage trucks and purchase of another 20 <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> may increase the capacity of Waste Management Office to do full rounds of garbage every week.|$|E

25|$|I-278 turns west to {{run along}} the eight-lane state-maintained Grand Central Parkway, with Astoria Boulevard (and Hoyt Avenue later on) serving as a {{frontage}} road. The frontage road serves as a truck route since large trucks are not permitted on the Grand Central. Exemptions are provided for smaller <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> conform with strict regulations, but only on {{the section of the}} Grand Central that overlaps with I-278. The road runs along a depressed alignment, passing under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. At the 31st Street interchange, the Grand Central Parkway overlap ends, and I-278 continues northwest along the tolled, eight-lane Triborough Bridge, which passes over Astoria. Eastbound tolls are collected electronically at this point.|$|E
25|$|On March 31, 1978, AMC and Renault {{announced}} a sweeping agreement {{for the joint}} manufacture and distribution of cars and <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> would achieve benefits for both. A month later, AMC {{announced that it would}} halt the production of standard urban transit buses after about 4,300 were sold by its AM General subsidiary during three years. In May 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the recall of all AMC's 1976 cars (except those conforming to California emissions regulations) – some 270,000 vehicles— plus 40,000 1975 and 1976 Jeeps and mini trucks, for correction of a fault in the pollution control system. Total cost was estimated at up to $3million—more than AMC had earned the previous quarter.|$|E
25|$|While {{the bridges}} were being {{prepared}} and constructed, a large fleet of vessels were employed. Within {{the next few}} days, the 819th Amphibian Truck Company arrived with DUKW amphibious <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> were used to carry ammunition, gasoline, and rations across the river. The 86th Engineer Heavy Pontoon Battalion and the 291st Engineer Combat Battalion were assigned the mission to build three pontoon ferries. U.S. Naval Unit 1 brought up 24 U.S. Navy LCVP landing craft. The LCVPs were especially useful because they could ferry 32 men across the river in seven minutes, faster than they could walk across the bridge. All of these constantly shuttled across the river, delivering vehicles, equipment, and troops {{to one side and}} ferrying wounded to the other.|$|E
