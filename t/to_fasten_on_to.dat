The future of any civilized society is dependent on the quality of what is used as money. · The US dollar has been the dominant currency in the aftermath of the Second World War. · Currently the US dollar is facing stiff competition from the Euro. The fiscal year 2002 has witnessed the depreciation of the US dollar against the Euro. · The internationalization of a currency begins when an individual agent or institution residing in a country other than that of this currency accepts or uses it as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value. · One of the main factors in establishing a currency’s international importance is its use in trade transactions i. e. its use as a vehicle currency. There are two types of vehicle currencies — those, which serve as media of exchange in goods exchange and those, which serve as media of exchange in currency exchange. · A reserve currency is one, which is widely held in international central bank reserves. The dollar is currently the dominant reserve currency. · The chronology of many dominant world currencies is as afore- mentioned. Byzantine gold nomisma (in the fifth-seventh century), followed by the Arab Dinar (mancus or marabotin, eighth-twelfth century), the Florentine fiorino (thirteenth-fourteeth century), the Venetian ducato (fifteenth century), the UK pound sterling (sixteenth century till the Second World War) and the US dollar (from the Second World War). · It would not be wrong to state that that Gold is money. Gold is money because it fulfills, to an extent unmatched by any other physical commodity (Silver comes closest), all the pre-requisites of a money. · Trade in primary commodities shows a stronger pattern of using a single national money as the main currency of invoice. Exports of homogeneous primary products such as oil, wheat, and copper all tend to be invoiced in dollars, with worldwide price formation in a centralized exchange. · Trade in primary commodities shows a stronger pattern of using a single national money as the main currency of invoice. Exports of homogeneous primary products such as oil, wheat, and copper all tend to be invoiced in dollars, with worldwide price formation in a centralized exchange. · Prior to the advent of the Euro, most of the intra-European trade had the US dollar on one side of their transactions. Subsequent to the introduction of the single currency — Euro, all intra-European invoicing is being prepared in Euro. · It is difficult to explain the persistence of the dollar as international money in the face of competition from other national monies such as the newly created Euro. A possible explanation is that international money is both necessary and a natural monopoly. In the absence of a purely non national international money such as gold, world financial and goods markets will naturally pick one national currency to be at once the inter-bank vehicle currency.

40|$|Beyond Utopia is {{a project}} {{initiated}} by the collaborative practice of Sophie Warren and Jonathan Mosley with writer of art and architecture Robin Wilson. Initial stages of the project were funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. With reference to the American Marxist theorist Fredric Jameson and the French philosopher Louis Marin the particular value of utopian thinking is explored in Beyond Utopia, not as a medium of escapism per se, {{but rather as a}} critical tool with which to speculate and reveal the limits of our present 'reality' and its systems. Our aim was to generate a utopian architectural proposal for a real site and submit it to the scrutiny of the institutions that dominate the design and programming of city space in order to establish a critical dialogue with these institutions and find new sites of productive tension between the 'real' and the 'fictional'. As artists we engaged these institutions through playful provocation, drifting as provocateurs in and through the procedures, systems and languages of planning, architecture and city development. Our provocation, the utopian figure of the First Build, a work of fiction rather than an actualised programme in the world, seemed to gain life as it was recounted and discussed, its narrative shared, activated and engaged through dialogue with and by planning officials and reviewers. It began to imagine something 'other' for its real site beyond the desire and discourse of the institution and speculate how a 'next move' might be determined. The Next Move The 'next move' {{takes the form of a}} publication entitled Beyond Utopia which reads as a screenplay accompanied by six essays or creative contributions. The research process forms the backbone of the publication and the premise for a departure into fiction. The screenplay (of the utopian figure of the First Build) infiltrates the languages of planning and utopian fiction, weaving interviews into narrative form, blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction, the theoretical and the imaginary to assert itself as a fictional reality. The theory within Beyond Utopia develops a contingent relationship with itself and 'writing-as-criticism' 1 becomes writing as language. Writers from various fields are invited <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> emergent concepts raised in the screenplay and develop their propositional nature and establish new grounds for speculation as to how to play utopia. The publication aims to provide a place for contributors to 'worry' at the intersections of art and architecture, the theoretical and the imaginary, fact and fiction. Contributors are invited to bear in mind the reader as a critical other in the conversation around the utopian figure of the First Build. The publication Beyond Utopia aims to provoke speculation, proposition and play in the reader in the idea of 'something missing' 2 in the production of city space and urban relations and in the question 'what if?'. The publication will ask the reader how we can actively resist restrictive canons of standardisation to produce a 'specific sociability' 3 and an emergent environment built collectively, spontaneously and in support. 1.

Our exploration of writing-as-criticism in relation to fiction and the presentation of a screenplay as an artwork in some ways relates to Mel Bochner's testing of the boundaries between writing-as-criticism and writing-as-visual-art 2.

60|$|SATURDAY.--She fell in {{the pond}} {{yesterday}} when {{she was looking at}} herself in it, which she is always doing. She nearly strangled, and said it was most uncomfortable. This made her sorry for the creatures which live in there, which she calls fish, for she continues <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> names <b>on</b> <b>to</b> things that don't need them and don't come when they are called by them, which is a matter of no consequence to her, she is such a numbskull, anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last night and put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now and then all day and I don't see that they are any happier there then they were before, only quieter. When night comes I shall throw them outdoors. I will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and unpleasant to lie among when a person hasn't anything on.|$|R

The no-choice bioassay method was performed described by Kang et al. [23] and Ganapaty et al. [24]. DI-diluted wood vinegars (0.3  ml) with concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 % (v/v) were pipetted onto filter papers (Whatman No. 1, 55  mm diameter). The treated filter paper was placed into a Petri dish (60  mm in diameter), and 50 workers and 5 soldiers were placed on each filter paper. Filter papers treated with DI were used as controls. Test dishes were then covered and placed in an incubator maintained at 26.5  °C and 80 % RH in the dark. Three replicates were made for each concentration, and the mortalities of the termites were counted daily for 21 days.
