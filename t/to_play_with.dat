5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, cats prefer <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. Cats also tend <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> toys more {{when they are}} hungry. String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become caught {{at the base of the}} cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> the cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At {{the end of the}} match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} factor {{that helped the}} All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each half was 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain.
