David tells Joe {{he saw the}} Blue Fairy {{underwater}} and wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities using an electromagnet. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter {{to go to the}} Fairy, which {{turns out to be a}} statue at Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. David asks repeatedly to be turned into a real boy until the ocean freezes and is deactivated once his power source is drained.|$|E

Brahma agreed and he ordered Ganga <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Earth {{and then on to}} the nether regions so that the souls of Bhagiratha's {{ancestors}} would {{be able to go to}} heaven. Ganga felt that this was insulting and decided to sweep the whole Earth away as she fell from the heavens. Alarmed, Bhagiratha prayed to Shiva that he break up Ganga's descent.|$|E

The wins over Westmeath and Carlow {{represented}} the first time a Kerry team strung two consecutive Championship victories together. It also marked the first occasion that the Kerry hurling team played more championship games then the Kerry football team.|$|E

Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do {{for such a long}} time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{started his}} career with Lincoln City in 1986. Nicholson made his début for the club on 22 November 1986 in a match against Burnley, {{becoming}} the youngest ever Lincoln City player {{to play in the}} Football League, at the age of 16 years and 172 days. Nicholson went on to play in seven league games during the 1986–87 season, a campaign which ended in the club being relegated from The Football League, the first team <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Non-League football in the post election system. They did, however return to the League in the 1987–88 season, after winning the Football Conference. After the club's promotion to the Division Four, Nicholson became a first team regular, playing 126 league games in four seasons, scoring six goals.|$|E

25|$|It {{was usually}} several meters {{deep into the}} ground, in some cases, 20 meters by {{stepping}} down the stone steps. In the 13th century, excavation of wells started and in an early 18th-century document, 59 wells were recorded. Among them, Yamatsugā which was developed in 1720, was designated as an important site by the Hirara City (now Miyakojima City) education committee. It was a rich spring, and was used only by the government officials at the time. There was a guard posted at the spring. It was the duty of women <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the caves and draw water, and since the Meiji era, girls {{went down to the}} caves and draw water, as adult women had other duties. Due to the increase in population, it became a business to sell water from neighboring places.|$|E
25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to {{tell the}} flight attendants to prepare for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to contact them through the intercom. He asked the captain for permission <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{find out what was}} happening, and Cronin agreed. Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers. As he went down to the lower deck, the magnitude of the damage became apparent as he saw the large hole {{in the side of the}} cabin. Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door. He concluded that it was probably a bomb and that, considering the damage, it would be unwise to exceed the airplane's stall speed by more than a small margin.|$|E

500|$|On 22 March 2016, a fatal {{accident}} occured off Pasir Ris MRT station. Two of SMRT's track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally {{run over by}} an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They {{were part of a}} technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris Station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.|$|E

In many instances he dubbed ten channels with identical guitar parts, {{in an effort to}} create a sonic volume. Creation's owner Alan McGee visited the studio during the mixing stage; he said, [...] "I used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the studio, and there was so much cocaine getting done at that point... Owen was out of control, and he was the one in charge of it. The music was just fucking loud." [...] Morris responded, [...] "Alan McGee {{was the head of the}} record company. Why didn’t he do something about the “out of control” record producer”? Obviously, the one not in control was the head of the record company." [...] He further explained that he and the band had been dealing with personal difficulties the day and night before McGee visited the studio.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) share {{lunch with}} Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) {{to thank him}} for {{protecting}} her from Frank in [...] "Vandalism". They are expecting his wife Alyssa to join him, but Brian reveals they are getting a divorce after having been fighting for a while. In an awkward attempt to lighten the mood, Brian makes a joke referencing how he consoled Pam when she broke down after her fight with Jim over the phone in [...] "Customer Loyalty". After the lunch Jim admits, with some prodding, that he is angry that Pam did not tell him about this incident. Pam explains that she had not wanted to add to his worries, which only makes Jim angrier, but he brushes the matter off to avoid an argument. The couple had planned on sharing an evening bottle of wine for Valentine's Day, but Jim later tells Pam he wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Philadelphia instead because he fears they would only end up fighting. Pam initially accepts this, but realizing that the silence between them is worse than fighting, she tells Jim he should stay and fight with her, and Jim agrees.|$|E
500|$|Owen {{launched}} {{a run for}} the Presidency in Oklahoma on May 19, 1919, and undertook a tour of several states, seeking support, in the spring of 1920. [...] He published a number of books during this period, publicizing his involvement in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act and his views on a variety of economic and foreign policy issues (see Works by Robert Latham Owen below). [...] Owen received some indications of support from his fellow-Progressive and long-time ally, the party's three-time standard-bearer William Jennings Bryan, who joined him on his campaign visits to some of the Western states, but Bryan's support for Owen was lukewarm, his influence in the party was past his peak, and he placed much of his focus in 1920 on promoting the cause of prohibition, the main theme of his eventual speech at the convention. [...] Bryan declined to run for the nomination himself for multiple reasons — his health was problematic (he described himself to one journalist as [...] "at the end of life") and he expected the Democrats <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> defeat — though he privately left open the possibility of accepting the nomination in exceptional circumstances. Owen, for his part, gained few significant endorsements.|$|E
500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E
