Rapid economic growth in Asia and relatively deeper cuts in protection in that region, result in larger proportionate welfare gains in the year 2005 than in the year 1992.

40|$|Rapid {{industrialization}} in East Asia, particularly China, {{is raising}} questions about who will feed {{the region in the}} next century and how Asia will pay for its food imports. The paper addresses this question by first reviewing existing food sector projections and then taking an economy-wide perspective using projections to 2005, based on the global CGE model known as GTAP. After showing the impact of implementing the Uruguay Round, the paper explores the effects of slower global agricultural productivity growth and of slower economic growth in China. Several policy shocks are also examined. They include the entry of China (and hence Taiwan) into the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the failure to fully abolish <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on textiles and clothing trade as promised under the Uruguay Round. A slow-down in farm productivity growth could be very costly to the world economy, as could slower economic growth in China. Failure to honour Uruguay Round obligations to open textile and clothing markets in OECD countries is shown to reduce East Asia’s industrialization and thereby slow its net imports of food. On the other hand, the trade reform that is likely to accompany China’s WTO membership would greatly benefit the economies of China and the world. It would boost exports of manufactures and strengthen food import demand, not only by China, but also its densely populated neighbours with whom its intra- and inter-industry trade in manufactures would intensify.

40|$|Abstract: Since the 1950 s, {{global trade}} in {{textiles}} and clothing has seen {{the evolution of a}} global system of <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> governing North-South trade in textiles and wearing apparel. As of 2005, these have been removed {{under the terms of the}} 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. In theory, the ATC was to have led to a smooth and progressive liberalization in the sector. In reality and especially when looking at trade flows from China, it appears that political leaders throughout the ATC period instead backloaded the problem of adjustment, delaying much of it until the very end of the ATC. In this paper, we explore econometrically the evolution of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sectors (T&C). Working with a panel of bilateral trade data on textile and clothing trade, underlying <b>bilateral</b> tariffs, and <b>the</b> coverage of quotas under the WTOs Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) we first develop an estimation framework for calculating the tax equivalents of ATC <b>quota</b> restrictions on <b>bilateral</b> trade. Within this framework, we track the price impact of the quotas through the ten year phase-out period. We also discuss a major concern of LDC exporters the impact of quota elimination on market access. Finally, as these quotas are a potentially significant omitted variable, the ATC episode provides us with an opportunity to examine <b>the</b> impact of <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on <b>the</b> econometric estimation of trade elasticities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} both national and global welfare costs of <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on textiles and apparel using an applied {{general equilibrium model}} which covers <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on exports of textiles and apparel negotiated between three major developed importing countries (the US, Canada and the EEC) and 34 supplying developing countries under {{the provisions of the}} Multifibre Arrangement applying in mid- 1980 s (MFA 111). Results using 1986 data clearly show {{that the vast majority of}} developing countries gain from MFA removal, with some gaining proportionately more than others. This suggests that despite foregone rent transfers, developing countries would receive gains by eliminating the MFA. In the central variant analysis, all developing countries gain by eliminating tariff and MFA restrictions because, contrary to popular belief, the developing countries (including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan) are relatively small compared to developed countries even in apparel production. Rather than losing share to other developing countries under an MFA elimination, higher Income developing countries (like other developing countries) gain market share at the expense of reduced developed country production. ...|$|R
40|$|Emphasizing the {{importance}} of evaluating the Uruguay Round {{in the context of}} a changing world economy, the authors base their projections on a model that incorporates certain economic shifts: 1) that the center of economic gravity will shift toward the South and toward Asia (a shift that is already under way and shows no signs of abating), and 2) that the pattern of comparative advantage will continue to change, with the East Asian economies gaining comparative advantage in the production of physical and human-capital-intensive products. The authors argue that these changes in the global economy significantly affect their analysis of the Uruguay round reforms, for two reasons. First, with the global distribution of trade and production shifting toward Asia, the deeper Uruguay Round cuts inthat region become more important, giving rise to a 17 percent increase in the proportionate welfare gain after implementation of tariff cuts. Second, without the Round, almost all of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> associated with the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) would have become more binding and the resulting distortion would have been significantly greater. In this analysis, the global gain from MFA reform is 60 percent greater than it would have been without taking into account the effects of growth. Of course, procedures for implementation of the MFA reforms are more complex than they have conveyed for purposes of analysis. In practice, one must also consider the impact of accel quota growth under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. But even when the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing is implemented over the period for which projections were made, quota rents rise for many bilateral flows. This is a consequence both of shifts in comparative advantage toward the supplying countries and of simultaneous cuts in tariffs on textiles and clothing. The projections approach used here may be viewed as a logical extension of the growing econometric literature seeking to explain the determinants of economic growth through regression analysis. By offering a bridge between econometric evidence and computable general equilibrium modeling, the authors hope to combine the two approaches to help shed light on the interaction between trade reform and economic growth.

40|$|In October 2004 the European Union and the MERCOSUR {{tried to}} reach an {{agreement}} for creating what would be the world's largest free-trade area accounting for 650 millions people. But despite five years of bilateral work to strike a deal, the two parties stayed on ropes at their meeting in Portugal the 18 th of October 2004. The stumbling blocks are the MERCOSUR's demand for a greater access to EU's agricultural markets and the EU's demand for expanded access for industrial goods, services and investments.

40|$|Abstract. So far, resting state {{functional}} connectivity (RSFC) {{has been}} per-formed mainly by seed correlation analysis (SCA) on functional MRI (fMRI) studies. In previous studies, the seeds are usually selected {{on the basis}} of prior anatomical information or previously performed activation maps. In this paper, we proposed a novel way to select the desired seeds by taking the natures of resting state data into account. The proposed approach is based on the meas-urement of regional homogeneity (ReHo) of brain regions. Using this technique, 2 locations showing higher ReHo in the cerebellum (i. e. <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> anterior inferior cerebellum, AICb) were identified and used as the seeds for RSFC pat-terns studies. We found that <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> AICb show significant functional con-nectivity with <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> thalamus, <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> hippocampus, <b>the</b> precuneus, the temporal lobe and the prefrontal lobe. Further, the differences of RSFC pat-terns between <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> AICb were ascertained by a random effect paired t-test.

A group of thirty seven matched healthy control subjects were also included in the study. An optimized Voxel Based Morphometric (VBM) method customised for MS was applied on volumetric T 1 -weighted images. The functional status of patients was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Brief Repeatable Battery.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{internal}} thoracic artery is {{the gold}} standard conduit in coronary artery bypass grafting. Although {{the right and left}} internal thoracic arteries are excellent conduits, the use of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> {{internal thoracic artery}} is not widespread. A recent report of the Society of Thoracic Surgery revealed that {{only a small percentage of}} patients receive a bilateral internal thoracic artery in North America. The aim of this study was to determine the current use of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery during coronary artery bypass grafting among cardiac surgeons in Canada and identify the main concerns that limit the use of these conduits. MethodsWe developed an online survey with 17 questions about the use of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery in different clinical scenarios. An invitation to participate was sent to all the adult cardiac surgeons currently in practice in Canada. ResultsA total of 101 surgeons (69 %) of 147 currently in practice across 27 different hospitals completed the survey. Forty percent of surgeons use <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery only sometimes (6 %– 25 % of cases), 37 % of surgeons use <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery very infrequently (50 %). The most common concerns in the use of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery are the risk of sternal wound infection and the unknown superiority of the right internal thoracic artery over other conduits. ConclusionsThe majority of Canadian cardiac surgeons consider few clinical features, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or morbid obesity, as contraindications to <b>the</b> use of <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery. However, the reported use of <b>the</b> <b>bilateral</b> internal thoracic artery is low. A wider diffusion of this technique is warranted to improve the results of coronary surgery...|$|R
