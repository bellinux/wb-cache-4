5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the concept of <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{history of the}} {{fundamental}} length scales used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> atoms, or <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hadrons, or <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.|$|R

60|$|Secondly, Marinetti {{is wrong}} when he claims <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> the only mystery {{and the only}} reality. I say and as you, my reader, realize, I speak with authority--I say <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> the only illusion. Comte called the world, which <b>is</b> {{tantamount}} to <b>matter,</b> the great fetich, and I agree with Comte.|$|R

25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E
25|$|Singer {{argues that}} {{equality}} of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if {{the equality of}} the sexes were based only {{on the idea that}} men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> whether they can suffer.|$|E

500|$|The {{first draft}} of the book was {{finished}} in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy [...] "chewing [...] way through the editing, {{which has been a}} surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around." [...] The hardest part of editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. [...] "However, as most any writer will tell you, just because you spent ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to keep it in the final manuscript. The only question <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> whether the scene contributes to the book as a whole," [...] he said. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Alfred A. Knopf who worked with Paolini on Eragon and Eldest, assisted Paolini as the editor of Brisingr.|$|E
500|$|With little land {{action in}} the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the [...] "Bore War", later renamed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied {{officials}} and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. Chamberlain was reluctant {{to go too far}} in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, [...] "the only thing <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process". However, actual government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.|$|E

The president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival Apple's chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see who will become her vice president. However, Dwight begins having stomach pains, which Ryan suspects to be appendicitis. Dwight collapses during a presentation, the paramedics confirm appendicitis, and Dwight is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> [...] "desire."

500|$|The next {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Eddie Guerrero and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL). One preplanned move in the match saw Guerrero hit JBL with a steel chair, which caused JBL to bleed. Guerrero went on to touch three {{turnbuckles}} {{but was unable to}} touch the fourth as JBL held him back. Guerrero executed a dropkick on JBL and attempted to touch the fourth again but JBL held him back and took the advantage. JBL threw Guerrero into a broadcast table and executed a powerbomb through the broadcast table. In the end, each man had touched three turnbuckles and were vying for the fourth. Guerrero attempted to jump over JBL and touch the remaining turnbuckle, but was unsuccessful; he splashed himself and JBL into the turnbuckle. Guerrero was declared the winner, as it appeared he had touched all four turnbuckles first, but General Manager Kurt Angle came out and reversed the decision. He showed on the TitanTron that JBL's shoulder touched the final turnbuckle before Guerrero's hand, also, Angle stated that it doesn't matter which part of the body touch, all <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> who touch first; as a result, JBL won the title.|$|E
2500|$|For a poet of his stature, Eliot {{produced}} {{a relatively small}} number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, [...] "My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year.

40|$|Early modern {{debates about}} the nature of matter interacted with debates about whether matter could think. In particular, some {{philosophers}} (e. g., Cudworth and Leibniz) objected to materialism about the human mind on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> passive, thinking things are active, and one cannot make an active thing out of passive material. This paper begins by looking at two seventeenth-century materialist views (Hobbes’s, and one suggested but not endorsed by Locke) before considering that objection (which I call here the Activity Argument). In discussion, I note that several philosophers of the time believed <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> active. <b>That</b> view opens up a possible response to the Activity Argument. The paper concludes by looking at the views of two materialists of the time who also believed <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> active, Toland and Cavendish...|$|R

2500|$|A {{drawing of}} a graph or network diagram is a {{pictorial}} representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This drawing {{should not be confused}} with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph. [...] In the abstract, all <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> which pairs of vertices are connected by edges. [...] In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics. The problem gets worse, if the graph changes over time by adding and deleting edges (dynamic graph drawing) and the goal is to preserve the user's mental map.|$|E
2500|$|To die for Emperor and Nation is {{the highest}} hope of a {{military}} man. After a brave hard fight the blossoms are scattered on the fighting field. But if a person wants to take a life instead, still the fighting man will go to eternity for Emperor and country. One man's life or death {{is a matter of}} no importance. All <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> the Empire.

[...] Moreover, Prince Charles denies {{that his father had}} the authority, by law or tradition, to exclude him from the order of succession: [...] "Even if I accept their premise, referring me to the Senatus Consultus of Napoleon III, divorce did not exist under the Second Empire, so it cannot be taken into account for the succession.... Moreover, the hypocrisy of this argument is exposed by the dates: My father's will was written in May 1996. I only re-married in October. All <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> the Bonaparte tradition, which makes the eldest son the natural heir of his father." ...|$|E
