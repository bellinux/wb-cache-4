25|$|Although Bane {{had sworn}} off using Venom in Vengeance of Bane II in 1995, and his {{character}} is actually written as having kept <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> himself, {{it is still}} not uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device {{to the back of his}} head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of Secret Six, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.|$|E
25|$|The penal bond {{is another}} type of the bond that was {{historically}} used to assure {{the performance of a}} contract. They are to be distinguished from surety bonds in that they did not require any party to act as surety—having an obligee and obligor sufficed. One historically significant type of penal bond, the penal bond with conditional defeasance, printed the bond (the obligation to pay) {{on the front of the}} document and the condition which would nullify <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> pay (referred to as the indenture of defeasance—essentially, the contractual obligation) on the back of the document. The penal bond, although an artifact of historical interest, fell out of use by the early part of the nineteenth century in the United States.|$|E

Vanessa Bush of Booklist characterized {{the book as}} [...] "a revealing, at times horrifying look at the troubled-teen industry." [...] Publishers Weekly noted: [...] "With a useful appendix discussing {{when and how to}} get responsible help for a troubled teen, this book, filled with first-person accounts, should be required reading in Parenting 101", calling the work [...] "a courageousif horrifyingstudy of the tough-love industry".|$|E

500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, writing [...] " [...] {{has found a}} chart-topping formula, combin killer beats with lyrics about super-fun parties and hot pants." [...] Vena commented that, although the song was not groundbreaking and did not stray {{too far away from}} previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] or [...] "Take It Off", that hardly matters as [...] "it's another uber-fun tune about how awesome it is to dance the night away" [...] with an [...] "inspired [...] the recent rash of suicides among gay youth." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard gave the song a positive review; he praised Dr. Luke's production and the song's chorus. Lipshutz commented on the song's similarity to [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "Instead of straying from the 'TiK ToK' formula, 'We R Who We R,' ... smartly maximizes [...] most appealing qualities." [...] The review concluded that the song [...] "demonstrates that [...] still has mileage left in her electro-pop sound as she gears up for her next album." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "companion piece" [...] to Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] citing their similar subject matter and close releases. Nitsuh Abebe from NY Magazine complimented the song's chorus and trance pop elements. Abebe wrote that the song embodied a [...] "hollowed-out, free-of-yourself feeling", commenting that almost all electronic dance music imbues feelings [...] "that are almost spiritual, that sense of being subsumed and out-of-body". Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song [...] "incredibly stupid, but it has the main ingredients to make it a global hit: an insistent beat and positive lyrics <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> suspend time and keep us 'forever young,' or better yet, transport us back to a time when we felt like we were." [...] Newman referred to herself as one of the singer's biggest detractors, but wrote [...] "I like one of her songs--or at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms." [...] In an album review of Cannibal, Newman referred to the song as a [...] "great self-acceptance anthem.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Times, critic Benedict Nightingale {{gave the}} show {{two out of}} five stars and said, [...] "Where's the menace, the horror, the {{psychological}} darkness? For that I recommend a trip to Her Majesty's, not the Adelphi." [...] Another unenthusiastic review appeared in the London Evening Standard, where critic Henry Hitchings wrote that [...] "while Lloyd Webber's music is at times lavishly operatic, the tone is uneven. There {{are no more than}} a couple of songs <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> live in the memory, the duets don’t soar, and the ending is insipid. Admirers of Phantom are likely to be disappointed, and there's not enough here to entice a new generation of fans". Hitchings also commented that the story [...] "is largely predictable—and flimsy. The chief problem is the book. ... It lacks psychological plausibility. Worse, it lacks heart. There's little pathos or emotional tension. There is also scarcely a moment of humour [...] lyrics are prosaic, and the flickers of light relief are merely confusing." [...] Similarly, David Benedict of Variety wrote that the show [...] "wants to be a tragic romance, but it's simply torpid. Only a radical rewrite will give it even the remotest chance of emulating its predecessor." ...|$|E

60|$|Second, The second {{argument}} is this; because, if a spirit only {{could have made}} satisfaction for the sin of mankind, and have subdued Satan for man, without the nature of man, either there had been weakness in Body when he made <b>that</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> fallen Adam, That the seed of the woman should break the serpent's head; (for there hath been no need of and so no room for that promise) or else God having made it, would have appeared unfaithful, in not fulfilling his promise, by redeeming the world without it.|$|E
