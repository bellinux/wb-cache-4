5|$|G. tibicen tyrannica, a {{very large}} white-backed form found from <b>Twofold</b> Bay on the New South Wales far south coast, across {{southern}} Victoria south of the Great Dividing Range through to the Coorong in southeastern South Australia. It was first described by Schodde and Mason in 1999. It has a broad black tail band.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, when the General Steam Navigation Company, Kiama Steam Navigation Company and the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company were {{independent}} operations, the major {{ports of call}} along the south coast of New South Wales included Sydney, Wollongong, Shoalhaven, Merimbula, Kiama and <b>Twofold</b> Bay. After the amalgamation of the three companies, this list included stops at Gerringong, Batemans Bay, and Nelligen. Later, minor gold rushes at both Moruya and the Wagonga district resulted in their inclusion, and other ports were to include Bermagui, Eden, Narooma and Tathra.|$|E
5|$|The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but Integrity again {{ran into}} heavy weather off Cape Howe {{and was forced}} to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. The cutter entered what would later be known as <b>Twofold</b> Bay on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's {{surprise}} they discovered Contest, undamaged but unable to return to sea in the storm.|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a <b>twofold</b> opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|As with Hergé's two {{previous}} stories, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls {{was designed as}} part of a <b>twofold</b> story arc, to be concluded with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy's curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. This {{was not the first time}} that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously done so when authoring Cigars of the Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a <b>twofold</b> significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were <b>twofold.</b> Firstly, he was angry {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was <b>twofold.</b> The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been <b>twofold.</b> First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of aviation in the United Kingdom is increasing due to the increasing demand for air travel in the country. In the past 25 years the UK air transport industry has seen sustained growth, {{and the demand for}} passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase more than <b>twofold,</b> to 465 million passengers, by 2030. Two airports; London Heathrow Airport and London Gatwick Airport, are amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world for international passenger traffic. Whilst {{more than half of all}} passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports, regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade.|$|E
5|$|The school's inaugural EATS course {{consisted}} of thirty-one students, who arrived at Archerfield on 29April 1940; twenty-four {{of the students}} graduated. The second EATS course commenced on 27June; eighteen of the twenty-four students graduated. As of 15July, responsibility for all aircraft maintenance at the school {{was assigned to the}} Queensland Aero Club. Squadron Leader Roy Phillipps, a fighter ace with the Australian Flying Corps in World WarI, assumed command of No.2 EFTS on 20October 1940. Phillipps died on 21May 1941, when a private plane in which he was a passenger crashed after taking off from Archerfield. Operations at No.2 EFTS were increased <b>twofold</b> in August 1941; by 30September its strength included 202 officers and men, 1 civilian, and 91 trainees. Cross-country exercises could take students as far as Dalby and Coolangatta. Training accidents at the school were frequent, particularly from heavy landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{seizure of}} the Macedonian throne, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by a Spartan Prince, Cleonymus who was serving as an officer in his army. The Spartan persuaded Pyrrhus to assist him in his plot to capture Sparta. Cleonymus' motives in wanting to attack Sparta were <b>twofold.</b> Firstly, he bore a grudge because his countrymen had overlooked him in favour of his nephew, Areus I when determining the successor of the Agiad throne. Plutarch, the Greek historian, attributed Cleonymus' non-selection as king to his violent disposition and arbitrariness. Moreover, Cleonymus had been slighted because his new wife, Chilonis, had been seduced by Areus' son, Arcotatus. These perceived insults spurred Cleonymus to leave Sparta and scheme to usurp the throne.|$|E
5|$|While {{extensive}} {{technical studies}} and the raising of finance for the project were in progress, the city expanded significantly resulting in a <b>twofold</b> rise in population and a fivefold {{rise in the number}} of vehicles between 1981 and 1998. Consequently, traffic congestion and pollution soared, as an increasing number of commuters took to private vehicles with the existing bus system unable to bear the load. An attempt at privatising the bus transport system in 1992 merely compounded the problem, with inexperienced operators plying poorly maintained, noisy and polluting buses on lengthy routes, resulting in long waiting times, unreliable service, extreme overcrowding, unqualified drivers, speeding and reckless driving. To rectify the situation, the Government of India and the Government of Delhi jointly set up a company called the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 3 May 1995, with E. Sreedharan as the managing director.|$|E
5|$|In a 25 August 2009 ICF article, ICF Canoeing for All Committee and Canoe Kayak Canada's Domestic Development Director John Edwards thanked {{efforts of}} the paddlers {{involved}} in the paddleability events for the 2009 championships. Edwards stated that the efforts for paddleability's success are <b>twofold.</b> The first is for inclusion into the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece. Once this is recognized, the next {{goal is to get}} Special Olympic programs at a national level for inclusion into the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The second, a shorter-term one, is to have 24 nations from three continents participate at next year's canoe sprint world championships in Poznań. Besides the medalists from this year's world championships being from Italy, the United States, Canada, Brazil and France, other participants included Great Britain and Portugal. The process to include paddleability into the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil began on 1 October 2009 and approval was reached on 16 July 2010.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than <b>twofold</b> increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, UQ {{is ranked}} by Nature Index as the {{research}} institution {{with the highest}} volume of research output in both interdisciplinary journals Nature and Science within the southern hemisphere, with approximately <b>twofold</b> more output than the global average.|$|E
25|$|Vatican I {{defined a}} <b>twofold</b> Primacy of Peter— one in papal {{teaching}} on faith and morals (the charism of infallibility), {{and the other}} a primacy of jurisdiction involving government and discipline of the Church— submission to both being necessary to Catholic faith and salvation.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{solution}} {{with minimal}} life-style changes {{is using a}} well. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by <b>twofold</b> or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The sono arsenic filter eliminates unhealthy arsenic in well water.|$|E
25|$|Sainsbury's {{sold the}} Homebase chain in December 2000, in an <b>twofold</b> deal worth £969million. Sales {{of the chain}} of stores to venture {{capitalist}} Schroder Ventures generated £750million and sale of 28 development sites, which had been earmarked for future Homebase stores, were sold for £219million to rival B's parent company, Kingfisher plc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Twofold</b> tsunami impact: sea waves {{hydraulic}} pressure and inundation. Thus, the Indian Ocean earthquake of December 26, 2004, with the epicenter off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a series of devastating tsunamis, killing more than 230,000 people in eleven countries by inundating surrounding coastal communities with huge waves up to 30 meters (100feet) high.|$|E
25|$|The cantonal {{constitution}} of 1803 was revised in 1814. Because of the confessional heterogeneity of the canton's population, the 1814 constitution did unusually organise matters of religion, marriage and education {{not on a}} cantonal level but introduced a <b>twofold</b> division (confessional dualism), with separate Protestant and a Catholic assemblies subordinate to the legislative cantonal assembly (Grosser Rat).|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{manifestation of}} integration {{processes in the}} area of military and defense collaboration of the CIS member states is the creation, in 1995, of the joint CIS Air Defense System. Over the years, the military personnel of the joint CIS Air Defense System grew <b>twofold</b> along the western, European border of the CIS, and by 1.5 times on its southern borders.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} {{organized}} Christian creationism to Islam {{began in the}} 1980s, when the Muslim minister of education in Turkey turned to the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), a Christian institution then located near San Diego, California, for help in developing <b>twofold</b> curriculum that would teach evolution and creationism side by side. In 1990, the Science Research Foundation (BAV in Turkish) was formed in Istanbul, headed by Oktar.|$|E
25|$|The FDA {{requires}} all antidepressants, including sertraline, {{to carry}} a boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a <b>twofold</b> increase of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase of suicidal behavior in the 18–24 age group.|$|E
25|$|Next, take a Hamiltonian {{invariant}} under T. Let |a> and T|a> be two quantum {{states of}} the same energy. Now, if T2 = 1, then one finds that the states are orthogonal: a result called Kramers' theorem. This implies that if T2 = 1, {{then there is a}} <b>twofold</b> degeneracy in the state. This result in non-relativistic quantum mechanics presages the spin statistics theorem of quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|Zeng's {{legacy in}} history is <b>twofold.</b> On one hand he is criticised as a staunchly {{conservative}} traitor, but on another he {{is seen as}} a hero in preserving order and stability. Many in China and abroad admire his ability to successfully survive in the ruthless bureaucracy of the late Qing dynasty. Many have blamed Zeng for all the civilian losses and damages done during the Taiping Rebellion, while others criticise him for being too friendly with certain foreign ideas.|$|E
