25|$|Although {{the game}} is free to play, it {{supports}} in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items. These items include incense (which attract Pokémon <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> you move for thirty minutes), lure modules, to attract Pokémon to a fixed location, and lucky eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use. All Pokémon are displayed with a combat power. A Pokémon's combat power is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle. Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP.|$|E

500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> {{you have been a}} father, a benefactor and a friend for me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one of}} Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E

500|$|Willoughby's {{wardrobe}} {{was designed}} to reflect his [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "fashionable" [...] nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> an actor." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Pauline letters {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate their writings.

Balaam told them: [...] "Spend the night here, and I shall reply <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> the Lord may instruct me."

In a 1987 {{interview}} focusing {{upon his}} recollections of the bombing, Petts recollected: [...] "Naturally, as a father, I was horrified by the deaths of those children." [...] Petts then elaborated that the inspiration for the stained-glass image was a verse from the Gospel of Matthew: [...] "Truly, I say <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." [...] The Welsh Window bears the inscription, [...] "Given by The People of Wales".|$|E

But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|The protest arose {{controversy}} in political circles. Tsyganko reported a private {{interview with the}} Romanian envoy Artur Văitoianu.

If you give up autonomy, you {{will not have a}} Commissioner-General, but you will have a Bessarabian Chargé d'Affaires, a man of your own character, who will be nominated by the Central Power. The new [...] Directorate will remain in office until the meeting of the Pan-Roumanian Constitutional Assembly. Does this appeal <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> attractive?"

2500|$|The {{second stage}} in Byrd's {{programme}} of liturgical polyphony is {{formed by the}} Gradualia, two cycles of motets containing 109 items and published in 1605 and 1607. They are dedicated to {{two members of the}} Catholic nobility, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton and Byrd's own patron Sir John Petre, who had been elevated to the peerage in 1603 under the title Lord Petre of Writtle. The appearance of these two monumental collections of Catholic polyphony reflects the hopes which the recusant community must have harboured for an easier life under the new king James I, whose mother, Mary Queen of Scots, had been a Catholic. Addressing Petre (who is known to have lent him money to advance the printing of the collection), Byrd describes the contents of the 1607 set as [...] "blooms collected in your own garden and rightfully due <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> tithes", thus making explicit {{the fact that they had}} formed part of Catholic religious observances in the Petre household.|$|E
