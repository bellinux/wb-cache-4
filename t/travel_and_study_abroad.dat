25|$|In 1890 Nyström won a state {{grant to}} <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad,</b> {{studying}} at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890-91, and travelling throughout Europe. He travelled to Italy and Greece, exploring the ancient architecture, {{as well as}} around France and to England, where he was {{particularly interested in the}} medieval church architecture. During his time abroad he kept detailed notebooks and sketchbooks (nowadays held in the Museum of Finnish Architecture archives). In 1892, soon after returning to Finland, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute (founded 1879), where he himself had previously been a student, a position he held {{for the rest of his}} life, and where the head of the school at the time was Gustaf Nyström. He was a highly skilled draftsman and his talent was used first in teaching linear and free-hand drawing. In 1901 he was promoted to lecturer in architecture, teaching ancient and medieval architecture and their styles, along with exercises in design and drawing. For many years Nyström also taught ornamentation and style history at the Central School of Applied Arts in Helsinki (precursor to the present-day Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). He received the honorary title of professor in 1922. It has often been noted by his former students how very popular he was as a teacher, in part due to his keen sense of humour but also in conveying something of his drawing skills to the students. He also had a significant role in spreading the Art Nouveau style to several generations of students.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to recommending these institutional changes, the Task Force Report highlights both governments’ {{role in creating}} an environment that will encourage overseas exchange. In June 2014, the Report was presented in Tokyo to Prime Minister Abe and in Washington D.C. to Undersecretary Tara Sonenshine. Around the same time, Prime Minister Abe announced a series of structural reforms to underpin economic growth. Key themes of the policy include improving English language instruction, included replacing 1500 lecturers in eight Japanese universities with foreign professors, doubling the number of foreign professors who are in Japan now; lifting eight Japanese institutions into the global top 100 in {{the next ten years}} (currently, Tokyo University in 27th in the world and Kyoto University is 52nd); using the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to raise the standard of English in bureaucrats and students alike.The plan would mandate that individuals reach or exceed a threshold in scores on the TOEFL to gain college admission and to qualify for government jobs; and finally, collaborate with overseas counterparts to offer joint degrees to encourage studying abroad and learning English. Abe has also asserted {{that he would like to}} make English a required course starting from elementary schools and has expressed interest in reducing the financial burden to students in order to allow them to <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> Many of the aforementioned reforms are directly correlated with the Recommendations made by the CULCON Education Task Force.|$|E

50|$|Horatio {{was born}} on 3 May 1817, at Newport, New Hampshire, in the United States, {{was the son of}} David Hale, a lawyer, and of Sarah Josepha,who, after the death of her husband, turned to writing and became a {{prominent}} magazine editor. Entering Harvard College in 1833, Hale showed a marked faculty for languages. His first essay in original work appeared the next year, and attracted the attention of the college authorities. It consisted of an Algonkin vocabulary, which he gathered from a band of Indians who had camped on the college grounds. Three years later, when the United States Exploring Expedition to little-known portions of the globe was organised under Charles Wilkes, Hale was recommended, while yet an undergraduate, for the post of ethnologist and philologist, and obtained the appointment. From 1838 to 1842, he was employed {{in the work of the}} expedition, visiting South America, Australasia, Polynesia, and North-western America, then known as Oregon. From this point he returned overland. The Hale Passages of Puget Sound were named in recognition of his service to the expedition. The expedition went on to Polynesia. Of the reports of that expedition, Hale prepared the sixth volume, Ethnography and Philology (1846), which is said to have laid the foundations of the ethnography of Polynesia. He continued to <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> Having taken his degree of M. A., Hale made a short tour of Europe, and, on his return, studied law. He was admitted to the Chicago bar in 1855. In 1856, the Hales moved to Clinton, Ontario, Canada, where he administered the estate of his father-in-law. He began to involve himself locally in real estate development and other business and educational endeavours.He continued to reside in Clinton till his death, devoting much attention to the development of the Ontario school system. He was influential in introducing co-education of the sexes in high schools and collegiate institutes, in increasing the grants to these institutions, in establishing the normal school system, and in improving the methods of examination. The vicinity of the Canadian reserves on the banks of the Thames and Grand River gave Hale ample opportunity for further investigation into American-Indian questions. He discovered, and in 1883 published, under the title, The Iroquois Book of Rites, two Indian manuscripts, dating between 1714 and 1735, which is the only literary American-Indian work extant. His judicious introductions, careful translation and editing add much to the value of the work. In 1884, at its Montreal meeting, he reorganised the section of anthropology as an independent department of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He had already done a like service for the American Association. At the request of the British committee, he undertook the supervision of the anthropological section's work in the Canadian North-west and British Columbia. The reports, which are very elaborate, appeared in the published 'Proceedings' from 1885 to 1897. Continuing a member of the committee, he was asked to accept the position of vice-president at the association's meeting in Toronto (1896), but declined on the ground of ill-health. Among other learned bodies Hale was an honorary fellow of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, to which he contributed his latest papers.|$|E

40|$|In a {{world that}} is so fast pace and always changing, the human {{biological}} systems have need to adapt just as swiftly. WIth the dependence on culture that humans all share has led to the building of societies with complex rules, ideals, and accepted roles and ways of life. In these complex societies, great cities and governments have arisen but so too have unnoticed changes to human biology. One of these changes is with environmental stressors and the effects it has on the nervous system. The human body, in these modern times, still responds to perceived stressors with the release of chemicals and hormones that prepare the body for defense. This 2 ̆ 7 fight or flight 2 ̆ 7 response, however, is of not too much need in the modern, developed world that many live in today.

40|$|International travel has {{significant}} implications {{on the study}} of architecture. This study analyzed ways in which undergraduate and graduate students benefited from the experience of international <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> Taken from the perspective of 15 individuals who were currently or had been architecture students at the University of Miami and Florida International University or who were alumni of the University of Florida and Syracuse University, the research explored how international <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> enhanced their awareness and understanding of architecture, and how it complemented their architecture curricula. This study also addressed a more personal aspect of international travel in order to learn how the experience and exposure to foreign cultures had positively influenced the personal and professional development of the participants. ^ Participants’ individual and two-person semi-structured interviews about study abroad experiences were electronically recorded and transcribed for analysis. A second interview was conducted with five of the participants to obtain feedback concerning the accuracy of the transcripts and the interpretation of the data. Sketch journals and design projects were also analyzed from five participants and used as data for the purposes of better understanding what these individuals learned and experienced as part of their study abroad. ^ Findings indicated that study abroad experiences helped to broaden student understanding about architecture and urban development. These experiences also opened the possibilities of creative and professional expression. For many, this was {{the most important aspect of}} their education as architects because it heightened their interest in architecture. These individuals talked about how they had the opportunity to experience contemporary and ancient buildings that they had learned about in their history and design classes on their home campuses. In terms of personal and professional development, many of the participants remarked that they became more independent and self-reliant because of their study abroad experiences.

He then became a secretary to Voivode Mikołaj [...] "the Black" [...] Radziwiłł and a notary in the chancellery of the King of Poland in Wilno. In 1553 he was appointed as cannon of the Collegiate church in Kalisz and was offered the same position in Poznań, but did not take it. When Radzwiłł died, Mączynski settled in his home town, where he became a proponent of the Reformation. He was also at the Court of King of Poland Stefan Batory and became one of the Polish brethren (in Poland referred to as [...] "Arians") though he did not support the movement's more radical social program. He represented Sieradz at the sejm in Lublin where the union between Poland and Lithuania was established. He also took part in the Synod of Bełżyce and the 1560 Sejm in Warsaw where, together with Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, Mączyński argued for ecumenism and religious tolerance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In today’s {{integrated}} global economy, engineering collaborations {{span the}} globe. Thus, {{a key part}} to engineering education is to prepare students to be effective engineers in the international arena. Opportunities need {{to be provided for}} students to <b>travel,</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> work <b>abroad</b> for the purpose of deepening their understanding of other cultures and other ways of doing business. This paper presents a survey of <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> programs sampled from universities in the ASEE SE region that provide global engineering education opportunities for engineering students. The documentation and characterization of existing programs provides a foundation for forums to discuss topics of mutual interest, better understanding the problems/risks and rewards associated with the programs, comparing alternative study/work abroad models, and developing collaboration among programs.

40|$|Even {{though many}} {{university}} students <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad,</b> there is minimal literature and research about supporting these students {{when they return}} from their study abroad experience. In order to understand and incorporate the experience into the students’ everyday life, communication {{plays a key role}} in facilitating the transition back into the United States. Thus, the principal purpose of this study was to expand the research on reentry shock and communication by creating a new scale of reentry shock and testing a proposed model of variables to uncover which factor is most important (individual, interpersonal, and cultural). One hundred fifty eight former study abroad students responded to a 63 -item survey about their experiences returning from study abroad. The newly created, reliable, and validated scale, the Multifaceted Reentry Shock Scale, was utilized to test hypotheses about the three factors. Even though there was a strong rationale and extant literature support for all three variables to predict reentry shock, the findings only show social support as the most important factor. The new scale provides new ways for researchers to conceptualize and measure reentry shock, while the social support variable is informative for future research as well as study abroad programs at large.

40|$|Not Drowning but Waving: The American Junior Year Abroad” explores and {{describes}} study abroad amongst college students while also showing the historical roots of study abroad. This thesis seeks {{to understand the}} history and current issues in study abroad while also giving a literary description of the experiences, personal changes, and development of insight in the students who decide to study abroad. The Introduction serves both as the introduction to my project {{as well as an}} overview of the history and current issues within study abroad. It is divided into three main parts. The first section discusses the impetus for the project, the research methodology, relevant literature, and the genre of creative nonfiction. The second section covers the history of American <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad,</b> as well as the work of the Fulbright Program. The third section is a short survey of contemporary trends within study abroad, and addresses issues of gender, race, location, and student behavior while abroad. The creative portion of this thesis describes the study abroad students’ stories, experiences, and insights during and after a semester in Europe. The first three chapters of this section—“Leaving”, “Destinations” and “Guardians at the Gate”—describe some of the initial experiences during a semester abroad. Chapter one looks at the process of traveling to a new country and adapting to new cultural norms. Chapter two describes the study abroad destinations where I did my primary research for this project. Chapter three explores some logistical issues in study abroad, namely academics, finances, and housing. Chapter four explores the challenges students face after the initial excitement of study abroad wears off, and looks at the issues of student responsibility, danger, harassment, and alcohol abuse. Chapter five describes student travel habits, {{which is one of the}} most popular elements of study abroad but also one of the more problematic. Chapter six looks at the challenge of re-entry to North America for study abroad students, and chapter seven provides a conclusion to the piece.

40|$|Sweden has {{on various}} {{occasions}} {{been described as}} a multicultural society. So-called multicultural social change has resulted in numerous implications regarding attitudes in respect of history as a subject taught at upper secondary schools. The aim {{of this study is to}} problematise the relationship between students' (ethnic) identification and their view of history as a subject. The study focuses on the affects of history teaching on the students' perception of ethnic identification. On the basis of interviews with students, teachers as well as authors of history textbooks I analyse attitudes regarding the content and aim of history as a school subject as well as student's understanding of their ethnic identification. In addition I ask what the aim of history teaching in so-called multicultural societies is, discussing what kind of historical knowledge the interviewees regard as relevant and studying processes of identification. Consequently, I attempt to show what is expected of history as a subject in order for it to be accepted as both applicable and significant within a so-called multicultural social context. Many students want to learn about the history of their parents' country of birth, regarding it as a part of their identification. According to many students, prevalent history is Eurocentric, disregarding the importance of other cultures. Despite this, the importance of transmitting knowledge about Swedish and Western European history is widely articulated. Students' views regarding the content and aim of history are affected by aspects such as, a global economy, the media's impact on their world-view, their food-habits, their common generational experiences, their plans to <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> Moreover, students are affected by visits to and contact with their parents' country of birth, their parents' world-views, their own complex ethnic identification, their relationships with their friends as well as where they are geographically. In addition, I examine how emigration from Sweden between 1850 and 1930 and post war immigration to the country have been depicted. The latter is based on selected history and civics textbooks, all published in Sweden between 1962 and 2007. By and large, textbooks construct a ‘we group’, which is described as culturally different from the ‘them group’ (immigrants), that is to say those who are discursively constructed as a group which deviates from the cultural norms that are regarded as dominant and universal for Swedish society...|$|E
