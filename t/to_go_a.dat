5|$|The Aggies {{broke the}} losing streak in 1910 with a stalemate, 11–11. In {{the final minutes}} of the game, Hopkins was on the Maryland eight-yard line, second down with two yards <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> Johns Hopkins guard named Schrieber then ran from the field to their bench to leave a knocked-out tooth for safekeeping. The referee penalized the Blue and Black ten yards, and when their field goal attempt was blocked, the game ended in a tie.|$|E
5|$|In November 1996, Blancornelas was {{planning}} to visit New York City to receive an international award {{for his work in}} covering the drug trade, political corruption, and the relationship between the drug lords and the police. A few days before he was about to fly, a policeman in Tijuana visited Blancornelas and warned him that he was risking his life if he decided <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> year later, the warning proved to be true: in 1997 in Tijuana, Blancornelas was ambushed and wounded by gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel while heading to the airport for publishing a photo of the drug lord Ramón Arellano Félix. Blancornelas was nearly killed when the attackers opened fire on his car, wounding him in the abdomen and killing his driver and bodyguard, Luis Valero Elizalde, who died protecting him and managed to kill one of the shooters. Blancornelas suffered complications from the injury {{for the rest of his}} life. In the attack, Blancornelas' car was hit more than 180 times, but only four bullets penetrated the journalist's body. Elizalde, however, was hit 38 times. That same year, three other prominent journalists were killed in Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. <b>A</b> multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university as well as <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college.

5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told that they had <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth {{at the time was}} that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|UConn went unbeaten {{through the}} Conference {{regular season and}} Tournament and easily {{advanced}} into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest {{game of the year}} opened the doors of the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis. UConn blew out Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>a</b> lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.|$|E

Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris not to push him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and his right side is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E

25|$|The {{convoluted}} {{tubes of}} early designs {{such as the}} du Temple and Normand were the first <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>A</b> multi-row bank of tubes could provide adequate heating area, without this complexity. Tubes also became straighter, mostly to ease their cleaning. Yarrow had demonstrated that straight tubes did not cause any problems with expansion, but circular drums and perpendicular tube entry were both valuable features for a long service life. Where tubes entered drums at an angle, heating and cooling tended to bend the tube back and forth, leading to leaks. A perpendicular entry was easier to expand the tubes for a reliable seal and to avoid these sideways stresses. It was worth the compromise of the Admiralty boiler's bent tube ends to keep these two features, and these tubes were still simple enough in shape to clean easily.|$|E
25|$|The first union between Sweden and Norway {{occurred}} in 1319 when the three-year-old Magnus, {{son of the}} Swedish royal Duke Eric and of the Norwegian princess Ingeborg, inherited the throne of Norway from his grandfather Haakon V {{and in the same}} year was elected King of Sweden, by the Convention of Oslo. The boy king's long minority weakened the royal influence in both countries, and Magnus lost both his kingdoms before his death. The Swedes, irritated by his misrule, superseded him by his nephew, Albert of Mecklenburg in 1365. In Sweden, Magnus partialities and necessities led directly to the rise of a powerful landed aristocracy, and, indirectly, to the growth of popular liberties. Forced by the incompetence of the magnates to lean upon the middle classes, in 1359 the king summoned the first Swedish Riksdag, on which occasion representatives from the towns were invited to appear along with the nobles and clergy. His successor, Albert, was forced <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> step farther and, taking the first coronation oath in 1371, in which Albert swore to concede many of his powers to the nobility in the Regency Council.|$|E
25|$|In January 1910 Griffith and Lee Dougherty {{with the}} rest of the Biograph acting company {{traveled}} to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot Ramona in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands). After this, Griffith and his players decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> little further north to a small village they had heard about that was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this little place called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called In Old California, a Latino melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph’s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.|$|E

25|$|On 18 December, Southampton {{travelled}} to face local rivals Bournemouth, {{coming from}} a goal behind to win 3–1 and move up to seventh in the Premier League table. Nathan Aké opened the scoring for the Cherries within six minutes, but Ryan Bertrand scored less than ten minutes later to bring the Saints level. Both sides enjoyed numerous chances <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> goal up, {{but it was the}} visitors who scored again shortly after the break, when Jay Rodriguez tapped in a chance set up by substitute Steven Davis. Southampton dominated the rest of the game, and Rodriguez scored his second of the match to seal the win late on. In their first game after Christmas, Southampton lost 4–1 to Tottenham Hotspur on 28 December. The home side opened the scoring quickly in the second minute when Virgil van Dijk headed in a free kick from James Ward-Prowse, but it was the visitors who scored next as Delle Alli scored a header from Moussa Sissoko's deflected cross. After dominating {{much of the rest of}} the first half, Spurs went ahead shortly after the break through Harry Kane, who missed a penalty a few minutes later when Alli was fouled by Nathan Redmond, who was sent off. Son Heung-min scored a third for Tottenham late on, before Alli scored his second of the game to make it four. On the final day of the year, Southampton lost at home again to West Bromwich Albion, who won 2–1. After enjoying the majority of possession in the first half, the hosts went one up through Shane Long just before half-time, although the lead was short-lived as Matt Phillips equalised just a minute later. Shortly after the break, Hal Robson-Kanu scored a second for West Brom, which was enough to secure the win as the Saints failed to equalise late on. Virgil van Dijk was sent off late on for a second bookable offence.|$|E
