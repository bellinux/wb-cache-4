5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> work in progress for several years, {{and most of the}} finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E
5|$|The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have invoked {{much debate}} by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by {{historian}} R. Allen Brown, {{is that they}} were relatively advanced for their time and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no keep, for example – <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> very popular feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of ground-level arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham's defences is similar in many ways to Henry II's innovative work at Dover and Orford.|$|E

5|$|While pre-dreadnoughts {{were adopted}} worldwide, {{there were no}} clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships {{until the very end}} of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 {{influenced}} pre-dreadnought development, but <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> clash between Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also a mismatch, with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish cruisers. Not until the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 did pre-dreadnoughts engage on an equal footing. This happened in three battles: the Russian tactical victory during the Battle of Port Arthur on 8–9 February 1904, the indecisive Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, and the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing at one another at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, when Telecel {{was already}} {{controlled}} by the Vodafone Group, the parent company decided to implement the Vodafone brand worldwide, {{in order to achieve}} synergies and improve brand awareness. Telecel was the first operator to initiate the process. This was achieved in three steps: 1. putting Vodafone after Telecel, thus referring to the company as Telecel Vodafone; 2. after six months, exchanging the order to Vodafone Telecel; and 3. after another six months (already in 2003), dropping the Telecel brand altogether. Throughout the process, market research showed no confusion and no loss of awareness of both the brands and the operator. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> concern for Vodafone for Telecel was a top-ten advertiser, which had led to develop a brand with the highest recall indexes.|$|E

25|$|The main {{change for}} the 2012 models was the {{installation}} of a different engine from the Ford Duratorq engine range. Ford decided, due to cost reasons, not to modify the 2.4-litre engine introduced in 2007 to meet the upcoming Euro V emissions standards and so the engine was replaced with the ZSD-422 engine, essentially a 2.2-litre variant of the same engine. Although smaller than the existing unit the power and torque outputs remained unchanged and the same six-speed gearbox was used as well. The engine included a diesel particulate filter {{for the first time}} on a Defender. The only other change was the reintroduction of the soft top body style to the general market. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> popular option for the Land Rover Series but by the introduction of the Defender had been relegated to special order and military buyers only. Land Rover stated that the option was being brought back due to customer feedback.|$|E
25|$|Up to 11 policemen at a {{time had}} tried to control all this traffic, many of them {{standing}} on small wooden platforms positioned in key locations around the platz, but with varying success. The traffic lights, again from Siemens, were mounted on a five-sided 8.5 m high tower designed by Jean Kramer, shipped over from the United States, and actually modelled on a similar one erected on Fifth Avenue in New York in 1922, although towers like <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> feature of New York since 1918. A solitary policeman sat in a small cabin {{at the top of}} the tower and switched the lights around manually, until they were eventually automated in 1926. Yet some officers still remained on the ground in case people did not pay any attention to the lights. The tower remained until c.1936, when it was removed to allow for excavations for the new S-Bahn line (on 26 September 1997, a replica of the tower was erected, just for show, close to its original location by Siemens, to celebrate the company's 150th anniversary. The replica was moved again on 29 September 2000, to the place where it stands today).|$|E
25|$|In 1948, a top-secret Soviet bioweapons {{laboratory}} {{was established}} on the island, {{in the center}} of the Aral Sea which is now disputed territory between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The exact history, functions and current status of this facility are still unclear, but bio-agents tested there included Bacillus anthracis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Brucella suis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Variola major (smallpox), Yersinia pestis, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. In 1971, weaponized smallpox from the island reached a nearby ship, which then allowed the virus to spread to the city of Aral. Ten people there were infected, of whom 3 died, and a massive vaccination effort involving 50,000 inhabitants ensued (see Aral smallpox incident). The bioweapons base was abandoned in 1992 following the disintegration of the Soviet Union the previous year. Scientific expeditions proved <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> site for production, testing and later dumping of pathogenic weapons.

25|$|Paget's first post was {{probably}} at Blackley chapel, which {{was part of}} the parish of St Mary's Church, Manchester. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> collegiate church in the late Middle Ages, established in 1421 at the instance of Thomas la Warr, 5th Baron De La Warr, who became its first warden, by Henry V and Pope Martin V. Blackley chapel already existed at this time, and had been licensed for use by Roger de la Warr, Thomas's father, in 1360. There were a number of chapels in the parish, generally established initially to provide for the needs of local landowners and their dependents: the Byron family, who held Blackley of the de la Warrs and lived locally, had applied for licences for chapels across their Lancashire estates from the early 15th century. The college was dissolved at the beginning of Edward VI's reign, along with almost all other colleges and chantries in England, but, unlike most of the others, was refounded by Mary I. Whatever its institutional character, St Mary's church continued to hold the advowson of Blackley chapel. Blackley became associated with radical Protestantism in this period. The Marian martyr John Bradford {{was probably}} a Blackley man He was certainly strongly influenced by Father Traves or Travis, the minister of Blackley in the mid-16th century.|$|E
500|$|Many {{memorials}} drew on {{a classical}} style of architecture to produce their effect. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> popular style for many pre-war memorials, {{such as those}} for the dead of the Boer War, and used Greek or Roman structures, styles and symbolism. A key feature of the classical style was {{the concept of the}} [...] "beautiful death" [...] — classical memorials might include figures of soldiers, sometimes dying in conflict, but always heroically and, ultimately, peacefully. Soldiers in these memorials were still frequently depicted as Homeric warriors, rather than more realist figures. The classical symbolism was often used to distance the event of death from the observer, appealing to allegories for sacrifice, justice and victory, in an attempt to make mourning easier to bear.|$|E

500|$|First off, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being in zero gravity. As a child, <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> dream inspired by Apollo 11, and had stayed with him as an adult. When he was the computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, he learned of a program that NASA has that allows college students to go {{up into the air}} in NASA's Vomit Comet, which uses parabolic arcs to simulate the feeling of weightlessness.

Pausch proceeded to begin talking about his second childhood dream, playing in the National Football League. Although Pausch was never a player in the National Football League, he spoke about his childhood experiences with Pop Warner Football and how they had affected his life and taught him lessons. Pausch then moved on to his dream of publishing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia. As a child, Pausch always kept and read a World Book Encyclopedia in his home.

500|$|The Analecta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum {{claims that}} he was [...] "a Scot by birth", {{and that he was}} {{admitted}} into the Dominican Order of Paris in 1219. The latter source, however, is often highly unreliable, and cannot be fully trusted. The historian Archie Duncan was cautious about a date as firm and early as 1221, and wrote that Clement [...] "had entered the Dominican order by the later 1220s". Although [...] "Clement" [...] is neither a Scottish nor an English name, the large number of French-speakers in both Scotland and England during this period means that this consideration carries limited weight; indeed [...] "Clement" [...] need not even have been his birth-name. The diocese of Dunblane was entirely Gaelic-speaking in Clement's day, and in this era it was often frowned upon for a bishop to be ignorant of the language of his diocese. If <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> consideration in Clement's later appointment, then this would strongly suggest that Clement was in fact a Scot. It is worth adding that Clement was later noted for his skill in languages. Clement received his university education at either the University of Oxford or the University of Paris, perhaps at both of these institutions. There is a possibility that he can be identified more fully as [...] "Clement Rocha". A [...] "Father Clement Rocha" [...] was the owner of a manuscript from the period now held in Edinburgh.
