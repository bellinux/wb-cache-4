50|$|When {{considering}} the emissions from fossil fuel and biofuel use, research typically focuses on major pollutants such as hydrocarbons. It is generally recognized that using biodiesel {{in place of}} diesel results in a substantial reduction in regulated gas emissions, {{but there has been}} a lack of information in research literature about the non-regulated compounds which also play a role in air pollution. One study focused on the emissions of non-criteria carbonyl compounds from the burning of pure diesel and biodiesel blends in heavy-duty diesel engines. The results found that carbonyl emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde, were higher in biodiesel mixtures than emissions from pure diesel. Biodiesel use results in higher carbonyl emissions but lower <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions, which may be better as an alternative fuel source. Other studies have been done which conflict with these results, but comparisons are difficult to make due to various factors that differ between studies (such as types of fuel and engines used). In a paper which compared 12 research articles on carbonyl emissions from biodiesel fuel use, it found that 8 of the papers reported increased carbonyl compound emissions while 4 showed the opposite. This is evidence that there is still much research required on these compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrocarbons (HC) - A {{class of}} burned or {{partially}} burned fuel, hydrocarbons are toxins. Hydrocarbons {{are a major}} contributor to smog, which can be a major problem in urban areas. Prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons contributes to asthma, liver disease, lung disease, and cancer. Regulations governing hydrocarbons vary according to type of engine and jurisdiction; in some cases, [...] "non-methane hydrocarbons" [...] are regulated, while in other cases, [...] "total hydrocarbons" [...] are regulated. Technology for one application (to meet a non-methane hydrocarbon standard) may not be suitable for use in an application that has to meet a <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> standard. Methane is not directly toxic, but is more difficult to break down in a catalytic converter, so in effect a [...] "non-methane hydrocarbon" [...] regulation can be considered easier to meet. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, interest is rising in how to eliminate emissions of it. HC emissions can come not only from a vehicle's engine buts also directly from the fuel tank and lines, 24 hours a day, even when the engine is off; the complex system of fuel vent lines and a charcoal canister is meant to collect and contain fuel vapors and route them either back to the fuel tank or, after the engine is started and warmed up, into the air intake to be burned in the engine.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in air pollution constituents {{has focused on}} carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons as prime components of polluted air. Instrumental methods have been developed, and commercial instruments for continuous monitoring of these components have been available {{for a number of}} years. For the measurement of carbon monoxide, non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy has been the accepted tool, in spite of its marginal sensitivity at low parts-per-million levels. For continuously monitoring <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> the hydrogen flame ionization analyzer has been widely accepted as the preferred method. The inadequacy of this latter method became evident when it was concluded that methane is non-reactive and cannot be considered a contaminant even though present at over 1 ppm in the earth's atmosphere. Hence, the need for measuring methane separately became apparent as a means of measuring the reactive and potentially harmful non-methane hydrocarbons fraction. A gas chromatographic method for the measurement of methane and <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> which met these requirements has been developed. In this technique, methane was separated on conventional gas chromatographic columns and detected by a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) while the <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were obtained by introducing a second sample directly into the FID without separating the various components. The reactive, or non-methane hydrocarbons, were determined by difference. Carbon monoxide was also measured after converting to methane over a heated catalyst to render it detectable by the FID.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study were: (1) to perform resource assessment of the thermogenic gas resources in deeply buried (> 15, 000 ft) natural gas reservoirs of the onshore interior salt basins of the north central and northeastern Gulf of Mexico areas through petroleum system identification, characterization and modeling; and (2) to use the petroleum system based resource assessment to estimate {{the volume of the}} deep thermogenic gas resource that is available for potential recovery and to identify those areas in the interior salt basins with high potential for this thermogenic gas resource. Petroleum source rock analysis and petroleum system characterization and modeling, including thermal maturation and hydrocarbon expulsion modeling, have shown that the Upper Jurassic Smackover Formation served as the regional petroleum source rock in the North Louisiana Salt Basin, Mississippi Interior Salt Basin, Manila Subbasin and Conecuh Subbasin. Thus, the estimates of the <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> oil, and gas generated and expelled are {{based on the assumption that}} the Smackover Formation is the main petroleum source rock in these basins and subbasins. The estimate of the <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated for the North Louisiana Salt Basin in this study using a petroleum system approach compares favorably with the <b>total</b> volume of <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated published by Zimmermann (1999). In this study, the estimate is 2, 870 billion barrels of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated using the method of Schmoker (1994), and the estimate is 2, 640 billion barrels of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated using the Platte River software application. The estimate of Zimmermann (1999) is 2, 000 to 2, 500 billion barrels of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated. The estimate of gas generated for this basin is 6, 400 TCF using the Platte River software application, and 12, 800 TCF using the method of Schmoker (1994). Barnaby (2006) estimated that the total gas volume generated for this basin ranges from 4, 000 to 8, 000 TCF. Seventy-five percent of the gas is estimated to be from late cracking of oil in the source rock. Lewan (2002) concluded that much of the thermogenic gas produced in this basin is the result of cracking of oil to gas in deeply buried reservoirs. The efficiency of expulsion, migration and trapping has been estimated to range from 0. 5 to 10 percent for certain basins (Schmoker, 1994 : Zimmerman, 1999). The estimate of the <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated for the Mississippi Interior Salt Basin is 910 billion barrels using the method of Schmoker (1994), and the estimate of the <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> generated is 1, 540 billion barrels using the Platte River software application. The estimate of gas generated for this basin is 3, 130 TCF using the Platte River software application, and 4, 050 TCF using the method of Schmoker (1994). Seventy-five percent of the gas is estimated to be from late cracking of oil in the source rock. Claypool and Mancini (1989) report that the conversion of oil to gas in reservoirs is a significant source of thermogenic gas in this basin. The Manila and Conecuh Subbasins are oil-prone. Although these subbasins are thermally mature for oil generation and expulsion, they are not thermally mature for secondary, non-associated gas generation and expulsion. The gas produced from the highly productive gas condensate fields (Big Escambia Creek and Flomaton fields) in these subbasins has been interpreted to be, in part, a product of the cracking of oil to gas and thermochemical reduction of evaporite sulfate in the reservoirs (Claypool and Mancini, 1989). The areas in the North Louisiana and Mississippi Interior Salt Basins with high potential for deeply buried gas reservoirs (> 15, 000 ft) have been identified. In the North Louisiana Salt Basin, these potential reservoirs include Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous facies, especially the Smackover, Cotton Valley, Hosston, and Sligo units. The estimate of the secondary, non-associated gas generated from cracking of oil in the source rock from depths below 12, 000 feet in this basin is 4, 800 TCF. Assuming an expulsion, migration and trapping efficiency of 1 to 5 %, 48 to 240 TCF of gas is potentially available. The final recoverable gas is some percent of this estimated thermogenic gas resource based on the recovery factor for the specific reservoir. To date, some 29 TCF of gas have been produced from this basin. Also, the thermogenic gas, whether generated from late secondary cracking of oil to gas in the source rock or from oil to gas conversion in deeply buried reservoirs, migrated updip into shallower reservoirs, including the Monroe gas rock at depths of some 2, 000 feet...|$|R

This prediction indicates {{that even though the}} present day <b>total</b> petroleum <b>hydrocarbon</b> loading is negligible in the centre of the Al-Raudhatain depression, what has earlier entered the groundwater system from the contamination sources (pits, fringes and lakes) is still moving in the groundwater towards the freshwater lenses, and is likely undetected {{due to a lack of}} optimal monitoring bore screen depth.|$|R
40|$|Oil {{pollution}} of the Marmara Sea was investigated at 17 stations during February 2013. <b>Total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were determined against chrysene standard using spectrofluorophotometer. The highest oil pollution was found as 11, 9 μg/L at Station 7 in Dardanelles and 2, 71 μg/L at station 3 in Istanbul Strait. According to results oil concentrations in some stations {{are much higher}} than limit value. Long term monitoring is necessary on pollution due to busy traffic of Marmara Sea...|$|R
