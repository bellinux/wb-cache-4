40|$|Fall of 2009, The Cal Poly Aircraft Construction club {{restarted}} Cal Poly 2 ̆ 7 s {{quest for}} the Sikorsky prize. The Sikorsky prize rewards the first a human powered helicopter to sustain controlled hover for one minute without stored energy. Throughout the 1980 ’s, Cal Poly made three attempts; the most successful being the DaVinci III. Also, the DaVinci III was the first ever publically recognized successful human powered helicopter to leave the ground. This scope of this project {{is to improve the}} DaVinci III fuselage and drivetrain for the DaVinci IV. The DaVinci IV adopts the DaVinci III system layout and improves both weight and efficiency. The helicopter will be a single <b>tip</b> <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> with a single pilot. The tip propellers will be turned by unspooling thread at the propellers with a winch spool that the rider will be supplying power to. Specifically this document contains the fuselage, rotor hub, and drive train for the DaVinci IV. The fuselage functions as the support structure for the drivetrain and rider. The fuselage will maintain an efficient riding position while providing a rigid structure for the drivetrain to transmit power from the rider to the propellers. The rotor hub will attach the fuselage to the rotor while the rotor rotates above the pilot. The drive train will be a winch driven by the rider’s pedal strokes. The winch will spool the thread from the propellers, thrusting the propellers forward. The DaVinci IV will be 30...|$|E

40|$|This {{report and}} its lengthy {{appendix}} first reviews early autogyro history. The period from Juan de la Cierva's invention {{in the early}} 1920 s through to the U. S. Army Air Corps' choice, in 1943, of the helicopter instead of the more fully developed autogyro, is examined from a technical point of view. With this historical background in hand, simple aerodynamic technology for rotors, wings, propeller, and fuselages is provided for reference. The McDonnell XV- 1 convertiplane development and its program are discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on the wind tunnel and flight testing that was accomplished with two prototype aircraft in the early 1950 s. The <b>tip</b> <b>drive</b> <b>rotor</b> system with its ingeniously designed hub was well suited to high speed rotorcraft. The configuration was conceived by Kurt Hohenemser and Fred Dubloff.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of tip jet powered rotorcraft. The Percival P.74 was under-powered {{and could not}} fly. The Hiller YH-32 Hornet had good lifting capability but performed poorly otherwise. Other aircraft used auxiliary thrust for translational flight so that the tip jets could be shut down while the rotor autorotated. The experimental Fairey Jet Gyrodyne, 48-seat Fairey Rotodyne passenger prototypes and McDonnell XV-1 compound gyroplanes flew well using this method. Perhaps the most unusual design of this type was the Rotary Rocket Roton ATV, which was originally envisioned to take off using a rocket-tipped rotor. The French Sud-Ouest Djinn used unburnt compressed air to <b>drive</b> the <b>rotor,</b> which minimized noise and helped it become the only <b>tip</b> jet <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopter to enter production.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the German Army had an {{interest}} in a small helicopter for observation and communications duties that could be folded up compactly enough to be carried in a trailer pulled by a jeep.

40|$|Using minimal {{models for}} low Reynolds number passive and active rotors in a fluid, we {{characterize}} the hydrodynamic interac-tions among rotors {{and the resulting}} dynamics {{of a pair of}} interacting rotors.

The hydrodynamic interaction of passive rotors is known to contain an az-imuthal component ∼ 1 /r 2 to dipolar order that can yield the recently discovered “cooperative self-propulsion ” of a pair of rotors of opposite vorticity. While this interaction is identically zero for active rotors as a consequence of torque balance, we show that a ∼ 1 /r 4 azimuthal component of the interaction arises in active systems to octupolar order. Cooperative self-propulsion, although weaker, can therefore also occur for pairs of active rotors. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe nutational stability of a dual-spin, quasi-rigid, axisymmetric spacecraft containing a <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> is analyzed. The {{purpose is to}} examine a revised energy-sink stability theory that properly accounts for the energy contribution of the motor. An inconsistency in the development disproves the existing energy-sink theory's assumption that the motor of the system contributes exactly enough energy to offset the frictional losses between the rotor and the platform. Using the concept of core energy, the revised stability criteria for a dual-spin, quasi-rigid, axisymmetric spacecraft containing a <b>driven</b> <b>rotor</b> is derived. An expression for nutation angle {{as a function of}} core energy over time is then determined. Numerical simulations are used to verify the revised energy-sink stability theory. The dual-spin, quasi-rigid, axisymmetric system presented by D. L. Mingori was chosen for the simulation. Equations for angular momentum and total energy were necessary to validate the numerical simulation and confirm aspects of the revised energy-sink stability theory. These equations are derived from the first principles of dynamics and are included in the analysis. An explicit relationship for core energy as a function of time does not exist. Various models postulating core energy are presented and analyzed.

40|$|Abstract—A new, {{continuously}} variable transmission (ISCVT) that contacts with {{the inner and outer}} surfaces of a spherical rotor is introduced. ISCVT consists of four units, a pair of driving/driven rotors, a pair of pressure devices, four traction ball assemblies, and a ratio changer. The four traction balls are situated between the driving and the <b>driven</b> <b>rotors.</b> The ratio changer is located inside one pair of rotors and rotates with a helical groove. The traction ball connector moves through the groove in the ratio changer and varies the traction ball angle, which can change the speed of the <b>driven</b> <b>rotor.</b> The speed ratio of ISCVT is derived by kinematic analysis and determined by the height of the point of contact. We applied the moment equation in order to find the transmission efficiency. ISCVT was applied to a 110 kW passenger car. We evaluated its applicability to automobile usage through a numerical investigation. The maximum shear stresses are formulated by Hertzian contact theory. The lifetime is calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren method. Simulation results show that ISCVT with four traction ball assemblies is very compact with a high power density and high transmission efficiency. Based on this simulation, we have designed ISCVT and performed stress analysis to find shortcomings in ISCVT. The associated transmission performance is compared with that of toroidal CVT (TCVT) and shown to be excellent. We also applied ISCVT with higher capacity for a construction vehicle and truck.
