In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron (8th FS) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco, California. After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, he and forty other {{personnel}} moved on to Fort Mason, where sailed to Hawaii along with 1,500 other soldiers. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a naval task force. After an overnight stop at Suva, Fiji, they landed at their destination of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Initially <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and nothing to do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, the commander of Fifth Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport. In April1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{apocryphal}} {{story of}} King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders {{back into the}} pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling {{one of them to}} a position [...] back and [...] to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark [...] "angler". This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he [...] "went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over." [...] He claimed to have [...] "hit the first delivery to cover point but of course <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six." [...] The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale.|$|E
