5|$|Hsp90 is {{exploited}} by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often mutated, amplified or translocated in malignancy, and Hsp90 works <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> these cellular stresses induced by malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 {{leads to the}} degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their {{charging}} process draw very high current {{for a short}} duration of time which creates power pulsation on the grid.

5000|$|When the {{rendering}} is {{done and}} the buffer shared, the Wayland client should instruct the compositor to present the rendered contents of the buffer on the display. For this purpose, the client binds the buffer object that stores the rendered contents to the surface object, and sends a [...] "commit" [...] request to the surface, transferring the effective control of the <b>buffer</b> <b>to</b> the compositor. Then, the client waits for the compositor <b>to</b> release the <b>buffer</b> (signaled by an event) if it wants <b>to</b> reuse the <b>buffer</b> <b>to</b> render another frame, or it can use another <b>buffer</b> <b>to</b> render the new frame and, when the rendering is finished, to bind this new <b>buffer</b> <b>to</b> the surface and commit its contents.

25|$|Bioretention swales, similar <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> {{strips and}} swales, are placed within {{the base of}} a swale that is {{generally}} located in the median strip of divided roads. They provide both stormwater treatment and are. A bioretention system can be installed in part of a swale, or along the full length of a swale, depending on treatment requirements. The runoff water usually goes through a fine media filter and proceeds downwards where it is collected via a perforated pipe leading to downstream waterways or storages. Vegetation growing in the filter media can prevent erosion and, unlike infiltration systems, bioretention swales are suited {{for a wide range of}} soil conditions.|$|E
25|$|In Wallis and Futuna {{the local}} {{administrator}} and bishop sided with Vichy, but faced opposition {{from some of}} the population and clergy; their attempts at naming a local king in 1941 (<b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> the territory from their opponents) backfired as the newly elected king refused to declare allegiance to Pétain. The situation stagnated for a long while, due to the remoteness of the islands and because no overseas ship visited the islands for 17 months after January 1941. An aviso sent from Nouméa took over Wallis on behalf of the Free French on 27 May 1942, and Futuna on 29 May 1942. This allowed American forces to build an airbase and seaplane base on Wallis (Navy 207) that served the Allied Pacific operations.|$|E
25|$|Sodium amalgam {{containing}} 2–6% sodium (prepared by {{the treatment}} of ribbons of sodium metal with mercury(0)) is the most commonly employed reagent for the reductive desulfonylation and reductive elimination processes. Disodium hydrogen phosphate is used <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> the solution at a pH of 7–8, meaning that base-labile functionality is stable under the reduction conditions. Reductions employing aluminum amalgam (prepared by immersion of aluminum foil into a 2% aqueous solution of HgCl2) often require higher temperatures than the corresponding sodium amalgam reactions. Mercury and mercury compounds are poisonous and teratogenic, and should be used only in a properly functioning chemical fume hood. Mercury cannot be destroyed {{but it can be}} removed from aqueous solutions by using ion-exchange resins or by amalgamation with iron.|$|E

25|$|The western school whiting {{does not}} reach sexual {{maturity}} {{until the end}} of the first year of its life in deeper waters, while populations that inhabit nearshore waters don't fully reach maturity {{until the end of}} the second year. All male fish are mature by the time they reach 130mm in length and 160mm in female fish. The species spawns in deeper waters during a period between December and February, with a peak in early January. Anatomical evidence suggests S. vittata is a batch spawner, releasing eggs in batches over a period during the spawning months, possibly <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> against adverse environmental factors. juveniles reside in protected inshore waters such as bays and mangrove swamps until they reach sexual maturity, when they move offshore to spawn. Western school whiting usually reach 2 years of age, with some individuals surviving up to 7 years, allowing each fish to spawn multiple times throughout its life. The species reaches 30cm at its maximum length.|$|E
25|$|Natives of Buka and Bougainville at the {{northern}} Solomon Islands in Melanesia and the Chopi people of Mozambique in the southeast coast of Africa have darker skin than other surrounding populations. (The native people of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, {{have some of the}} darkest skin pigmentation in the world.) Although these people are widely separated they share similar physical environments. In both regions, they experience very high UVR exposure from cloudless skies near the equator which is reflected from water or sand. Water reflects, depending on colour, about 10 to 30% of UVR, that falls on it. People in these populations spend long hours fishing on the sea. Because it is impractical to wear extensive clothing in a watery environment culture and technology does little <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> UVR exposure.
