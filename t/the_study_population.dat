One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event.

25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> {{according to some}} ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size).

25|$|The present {{landscape}} {{shows the}} piecemeal {{nature of the}} mining. Although the lead industry began to decline in the late 17th century, it revived in the mid 19th century when tips were re-worked. Its mining history {{has given rise to}} street names such as Hind Pits Lane, Hollow Road, and Comrade Avenue. The old mines have also meant that the soil is heavily contaminated by heavy metals such as cadmium. This was investigated in 1979. Concentrations of cadmium, lead and zinc in local crops were higher than would normally be expected. Copper concentrations were normal, and the results for mercury showed that mercury translocation from soil to crops was very low. Dietary copper intakes at Shipham were a little lower than national average intakes. Four participants in the duplicate diet study, or 6% of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>population,</b> had cadmium intakes higher than 0.4mg per week.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even {{for those who are}} employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcys involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this.|$|E

2500|$|Haemochromatosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{heritable}} genetic conditions in people of northern European extraction with a prevalence of 1 in 200.

[...] The prevalence of mutations in iron metabolism genes varies in different populations. [...] A study of 3,011 unrelated white Australians found that 14% were heterozygous carriers of an HFE mutation, 0.5% were homozygous for an HFE mutation, and only 0.25% of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> had clinically relevant iron overload.

2500|$|One {{proposed}} learning {{mechanism is}} through the increased excitation, and as a consequence, strengthening of neuronal connections. This process is known as long-term potentiation (LTP). Another purpose of art therapy is determining existing disorders. Trauma, depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD {{are just a few}} mental illnesses that can be detected through art therapy. [...] "Sixty-four renal transplant recipients, 6-21 yr of age, were evaluated using self-report measures (CDI and Davidson) and art-based assessments. Subject art was analyzed by art therapists using seven of the 14 elements of the (FEATS), to assess depression. Unlike CDI and Davidson self-report testing, all patients were able to complete the art-based directives. When self-report measures and art-based assessments were combined, 36% of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>population</b> had testing results consistent with depression and/or post-traumatic stress. The FEATS assessments identified a subset of patients who were not identified using the self-report measures. There was a correlation between CDI and Davidson scores (p < 0.0001), Davidson scores correlated with hospital days (p = 0.05), and FEATS correlated with height Z score (p = 0.04) and donor type (p = 0.01). Patients who required psychological interventions including antidepressant therapy, psychological counseling and psychiatric hospitalization during the year after the study were identified as depressed." [...] As art therapy grows in popularity and gains recognition, the purpose will become more clear and branch out to different patients. The purpose of art therapy is to provide a new healing opportunity to those who will benefit most from alternative therapy methods. In conclusion, art therapy is one of multiple medicines to create peace in the patience's mind.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{malignant}} mesothelioma morbidity due to exposure to asbestos in a population living in districts Nova Gorica and Tolmin (49, 850 people) near the asbestos manufacturing village Anhovo (Slovenia) and to compare it with the entire Slovene population (1, 949, 750 people). Crude rates per 100, 000 people were calculated from the total number of mesotheliomas, and risk assessment in <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> vs. total <b>population</b> was based on 23 years worth of data. Time series data on mesothelioma cases were also processed as a forecast of new cases by 2010. The crude incidence of mesothelioma per 100, 000 individuals for all of Slovenia was 21. 4, while for the Nova Gorica district including the village Anhovo it is 170. 2 and for the Tolmin district 60. 9. The probability of a mesothelioma case in <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>population</b> was 8. 5 times the probability of the same diagnosis in the whole of Slovenia. Over 23 years, 28 % of all mesothelioma cases in Slovenia were diagnosed in <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>population,</b> which makes only 2. 5 % of the total Slovene population.
