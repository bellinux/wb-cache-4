5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to <b>track</b> <b>progress</b> and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E

More and more construction companies are putting aside {{the old way of}} <b>tracking</b> <b>progress,</b> which was mainly based on foremen daily reports and visual inspections, and are adopting 3 D sensing technologies as a new and modern way of <b>tracking</b> <b>progress.</b> Technologies such as 3 D laser scanners (LADARs) are investigated as a means to acquire comprehensive 3 D point-cloud data which can then be studied by management to determine the progress of construction. Although being much more accurate and efficient than visual inspections, this new <b>progress</b> <b>tracking</b> approach can be improved by applying object recognition algorithms that enable an automated <b>progress</b> <b>tracking.</b> This new approach has been investigated by other researchers, but only for <b>progress</b> <b>tracking</b> of structural elements.

The investigation is carried out on a field database acquired during the construction of the Engineering VI Building at the University of Waterloo.
