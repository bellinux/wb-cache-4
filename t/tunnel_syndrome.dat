5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, 8% of U.S. workers {{reported}} {{ever having}} carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 4% reported carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{in the past}} 12 months. Prevalence rates for carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the past 12 months were higher among females than among males; among workers aged 45–64 than among those aged 18–44. Overall, 67% of current carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> cases among current/recent workers were reportedly attributed to work by health professionals, indicating that the prevalence rate of work-related carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> among workers was 2%, {{and that there were}} approximately 3.1 million cases of work-related carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> among U.S. workers in 2010. Among current carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> cases attributed to specific jobs, 24% were attributed to jobs in the manufacturing industry, a proportion 2.5 times higher than the proportion of current/recent workers employed in the manufacturing industry, suggesting that jobs in this industry are associated with an increased risk of work-related carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are few {{disorders}} on {{the differential}} diagnosis for carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> if the diagnosis is unclear. Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is unlikely to be}} the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} this {{condition}} include intrinsic factors that exert pressure within the tunnel, and extrinsic factors (pressure exerted {{from outside the}} tunnel), which include benign tumors such as lipomas, ganglion, and vascular malformation. Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> often {{is a symptom of}} transthyretin amyloidosis-associated polyneuropathy and prior carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> surgery is very common in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that transthyretin amyloid deposition may cause carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 5% {{of people}} in the United States have carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> It usually begins in {{adulthood}} and women are more commonly affected than men. Up to 33% of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year. Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> was first fully described after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{factors such}} as genetic {{predisposition}} and anthropometric features had significantly stronger causal association with carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> than occupational/environmental {{factors such as}} repetitive hand use and stressful manual work. This suggests that carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> might not be preventable simply by avoiding certain activities or types of work/activities.|$|E
25|$|Recurrence of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> after {{successful}} {{surgery is}} rare.|$|E
25|$|Suggested healthy habits such as {{avoiding}} repetitive stress, work modification {{through use of}} ergonomic equipment (mouse pad, taking proper breaks, using keyboard alternatives (digital pen, voice recognition, and dictation), {{and have}} been proposed as methods to help prevent carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The potential role of B-vitamins in preventing or treating carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> has not been proven.|$|E
25|$|Some {{speculate}} that carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is provoked by repetitive movement and manipulating activities {{and that the}} exposure can be cumulative. It has also been stated that symptoms are commonly exacerbated by forceful and repetitive use of the hand and wrists in industrial occupations, but it is unclear as to whether this refers to pain (which may not be due to carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome)</b> or the more typical numbness symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous {{mutations}} in the gene SH3TC2, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, confer susceptibility to neuropathy, including the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|The role of MRI or {{ultrasound}} imaging {{in the diagnosis}} of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is unclear. Their routine use is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} {{between work and}} CTS is controversial; in many locations, workers diagnosed with carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> are entitled to time off and compensation.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} or no data to support the concept that {{activity}} adjustment prevents carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The evidence for wrist rest is debated.|$|E
25|$|As a note, {{a patient}} with true carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the thenar {{eminence}} (bulge of muscles {{in the palm of}} hand and {{at the base of the}} thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel. This feature of the median nerve can help separate carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> from thoracic outlet syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons {{recommends}} proceeding conservatively with {{a course}} of nonsurgical therapies tried before release surgery is considered. A different treatment should be tried if the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Early surgery with carpal tunnel release is indicated where {{there is evidence of}} median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment. Recommendations may differ when carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is found in association with the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, coexistent cervical radiculopathy, hypothyroidism, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{estimated}} to affect one out of ten people during their lifetime and {{is the most common}} nerve compression syndrome. It accounts for about 90% of all nerve compression syndromes. In the U.S., 5% of people have the effects of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Caucasians have the highest risk of CTS compared with other races such as non-white South Africans. Women suffer more from CTS than men with a ratio of 3:1 between the ages of 45–60 years. Only 10% of reported cases of CTS are younger than 30 years. Increasing age is a risk factor. CTS is also common in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|While being {{pregnant}} with her third child, Kiko was diagnosed with placenta praevia. The princess also suffers from carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> osteoporosis aggravated by child-nursing, a symptom common among middle-aged women, her doctor said on 14 December 2007.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, {{this type of}} mouse is {{intended}} to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries. It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{known as}} carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> had major appearances {{throughout the years}} but it was most commonly heard of {{in the years following}} World War II. Individuals who had suffered from this condition have been depicted in surgical literature for the mid-19th century. In 1854, Sir James Paget was the first to report median nerve compression at the wrist in two cases.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged GH excess thickens {{the bones}} of the jaw, fingers and toes. Resulting {{heaviness}} of the jaw and increased size of digits is referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome),</b> muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{evidence}} based guideline {{produced by}} the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons assigned various grades of recommendation to physiotherapy (also called physical therapy) and other nonsurgical treatments. One of the primary issues with physiotherapy is that it attempts to reverse (often) years of pathology inside the carpal tunnel. Practitioners caution that any physiotherapy such as myofascial release may take weeks of persistent application to effectively manage carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} CTS are of unknown cause. Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be {{associated}} with any condition that causes pressure on the median nerve at the wrist. Some common conditions that can lead to CTS include obesity, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance), and trauma. Genetics play a role. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Carpal tunnel is a feature of a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome type 1 called hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies.|$|E
25|$|Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CTS) is {{a medical}} {{condition}} due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after {{a long period of}} time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases both sides are affected.|$|E
25|$|Despite these improvements, Garcia's {{physical}} and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. By the beginning of 1995, his playing ability had suffered {{to the point where}} he would often turn down the volume of his guitar, a problem exacerbated by carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the ongoing loss of feeling in his extremities from diabetes. On the band's final tours, he frequently had to be reminded of what song he was performing.|$|E
25|$|Neurological: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} and {{mononeuritis multiplex}} may occur. The most common problem is carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. Rheumatoid {{disease of the}} spine can lead to myelopathy. Atlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process and/or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine's connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.|$|E
25|$|The {{first to}} notice the {{association}} between the carpal ligament pathology and median nerve compression {{appear to have been}} Pierre Marie and Charles Foix in 1913. They described the results of a post mortum of an 80-year-old man with bilateral carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> They suggested that division of the carpal ligament would be curative in such cases. Putman had previously described a series of 37 patients and suggested a vasomotor origin. The association between the thenar muscle atrophy and compression was noted in 1914. The name 'carpal tunnel syndrome' appears to have been coined by Moersch in 1938.|$|E
25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} {{because of the way}} the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> TMD, Tourette's syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{symptoms}} generally include coarse or rough {{facial features}} (including a flat nasal bridge, thick lips, and enlarged mouth and tongue), short stature with disproportionately short trunk (dwarfism), dysplasia (abnormal bone size and/or shape) and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), hernias, and excessive body hair growth. Short and often claw-like hands, progressive joint stiffness, and carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> can restrict hand mobility and function. Recurring respiratory infections are common, as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Many affected individuals also have heart disease, often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves.|$|E
25|$|MPS I H (also called Hurler {{syndrome}} or α-L-iduronidase deficiency), is {{the most}} severe of the MPS I subtypes. Developmental delay is evident {{by the end of}} the first year, and patients usually stop developing between ages 2 and 4. This is followed by progressive mental decline and loss of physical skills. Language may be limited due to hearing loss and an enlarged tongue. In time, the clear layers of the cornea become clouded and retinas may begin to degenerate. Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (or similar compression of nerves elsewhere in the body) and restricted joint movement are common.|$|E
25|$|MPS I S, Scheie syndrome, is the mildest form of MPS I. Symptoms {{generally}} {{begin to}} appear after age 5, with diagnosis most commonly made after age 10. Children with Scheie syndrome have normal intelligence or may have mild learning disabilities; some may have psychiatric problems. Glaucoma, retinal degeneration, and clouded corneas may significantly impair vision. Other problems include carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> or other nerve compression, stiff joints, claw hands and deformed feet, a short neck, and aortic valve disease. Some affected individuals also have obstructive airway disease and sleep apnea. Persons with Scheie syndrome can live into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Hand {{surgery is}} {{concerned}} with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Hand surgery {{is an important part}} of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. The hand surgery field is also practiced by orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons. Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. There have been cases of surgery to women's hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo.|$|E
25|$|During a heavy concert {{schedule}} in Russia in 1912, he interrupted his schedule because of stiffness in his hands. This {{may have been}} due to overuse, although carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> or simply swelling and puffiness of the hands associated with acromegaly may have been the cause. In 1942, Rachmaninov made a final revision of his troublesome Fourth Concerto but composed no more new music. A rapidly progressing melanoma forced him to break off his 1942–1943 concert tour after a recital in Knoxville, Tennessee. A little over five weeks later he died in the house he had bought the year before on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills. Melanoma is associated with acromegaly and may have been a final clue to Rachmaninov's diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Paget {{described}} {{two cases}} of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The first {{was due to}} an injury where a cord had been wrapped around a man's wrist. The second was due to a distal radial fracture. For the first case Paget performed an amputation of the hand. For the second case Paget recommended a wrist splint – a treatment that is still in use today. Surgery for this condition initially involved the removal of cervical ribs despite Marie and Foix's suggested treatment. In 1933 Sir James Learmonth outlined a method of decompression of the nerve at the wrist. This procedure {{appears to have been}} pioneered by the Canadian surgeons Herbert Galloway and Andrew MacKinnon in 1924 in Winnepeg but was not published. Endoscopic release was described in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of any}} {{keyboard}} {{may cause}} serious injury (that is, carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks {{to get up and}} walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.|$|E
