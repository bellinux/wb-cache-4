5|$|The building's {{southern}} facade, that of {{the original}} 1883 room, features three windows. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> has two rear windows of the same style. The windows are all double hung and of four-over-four design.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the novel, Charles {{returns from}} Europe; he and Mary {{establish}} something of a life together, but Mary is unhealthy and can barely stand to be in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> with her husband; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young.|$|E
5|$|The painting, {{the figures}} painted from life when possible, {{does not contain}} all the signers. Some had died and images could not be located. One figure {{had participated in the}} {{drafting}} but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> at the same time.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, aid {{tended to}} be limited to the elderly and disabled, and {{children}} had to sleep in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> as adults.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} located in the house and in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> in which Goethe lived with his friend the German painter Johann Wilhelm Tischbein during his stay in Rome.|$|R
50|$|As a {{freshman}} congressman, Pollock boarded in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooming</b> house as another new congressman, Abraham Lincoln (who {{would later become}} the 16th President of the United States), and they soon developed a mutual respect and longstanding friendship.|$|R
5|$|After Nana and Nunung fight, their guardians {{decide that}} it is best for Nunung to go the home of her uncle Tamsil (Usmar Ismail) in Bandung and rest. While there, Nunung writes a letter to her father that Joni kisses her goodnight every day. This news sparks Nenny's titillation and Toto's jealousy. Nana insists that Toto choose between her and Nunung; Toto decides to go to Bandung and protest Joni's impropriety. He confronts Nunung and confesses his love for her. She spitefully tells him that she sleeps in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> as Joni every night.|$|E
5|$|After {{driving home}} from work, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{is struck by}} a drunk driver and transported to a hospital, where she is {{examined}} by Dr. Preijers (Jack Blessing) and Nurse Edwards; she soon slips into a coma. Reyes, however, wakes up moments later in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> all alone. Running to the door, she discovers that the hospital is floating in a dark void. She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They assume that they are dead. Reyes, however, maintains {{that they are still}} alive.|$|E
5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the basic}} {{division}} of {{rooms in the}} living areas of Geestharden and Uthland-Frisian houses was <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in the working area were laid out differently.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1920s he was {{recommended}} by Cow Cow Davenport to J. Mayo Williams at Vocalion Records, and in 1928 he moved, {{with his wife}} and young son, to Chicago, Illinois to record. For a time he, Albert Ammons, and Meade Lux Lewis lived in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooming</b> house.|$|R
5000|$|A risk {{of using}} a {{balanced}} power system, in an installation that also uses [...] "conventional" [...] power in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms,</b> is that a user may inadvertently interconnect the power systems together via an intermediate system of audio or video equipment, elements of which might be connected to different power systems.|$|R
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At the far end of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room,</b> once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{is cited}} as an {{influence}} on Pablo Picasso's 1937 Guernica, which shows {{the aftermath of the}} Nazi German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. An exhibition in 2006 at the Prado and the Reina Sofía showed The Third of May, Guernica, and the Execution of the Emperor Maximilian in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room.</b> Also in the room was Picasso's Massacre in Korea, painted in 1951 during the Korean War—an even more direct reference to the composition of The Third of May. The perpetrators in this painting were intended to be the United States Army or their United Nations allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{burial ground}} preceded the meeting house, {{as the site}} was home to another meeting house that was {{constructed}} in 1859. The Benjaminville Meeting House represents a well-constructed example of Quaker meeting house architecture and contains within its design many of the major elements associated with the style. It is unique in that it allowed {{both male and female}} friends to worship together in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room.</b> The burial ground, however, maintains a strict separation, not by gender but by religious affiliation; there are three sections, one for Quakers, one for non-Quakers, and one for distant relatives of both.|$|E
5000|$|He kept <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> at St John's for 55 {{years and}} at the College Classical Society, which met in his rooms for 50 years, he would attempt to get the society to sing in Latin. One {{favourite}} was [...] "Waltzing Matilda", in which the chorus began with the Latin word for : [...] "ambiclitella! ambiclitella!".|$|R
60|$|Arriving at {{home and}} going upstairs, we found that my {{guardian}} was out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too. We were in <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>room</b> into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover, now her so altered husband, was the choice of her young heart, <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>room</b> from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise.|$|R
50|$|Gray’s {{first years}} in London (1931-33) proved promising. He rented {{a studio in}} Chelsea, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> {{previously}} occupied by painter John Singer Sargent. There he painted scenes of the River Thames alongside portraiture commissions. In 1933 Lord Brocket requested a full-length portrait, but Brocket died before any payment could be made. This virtually ruined Gray who gave up his studio.|$|R
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
5|$|The story, partly {{inspired}} by the life of Brubaker's uncle, is set in 1948 and stars Charlie Parish, a Hollywood screenwriter suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and fronting for his blacklisted best friend, Gil. When Charlie wakes from a blackout in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> as a murdered starlet, he and Gil set out to bring her killer to justice. As they learn more about her troubled past, they find themselves up against powerful Hollywood elites {{who do not want}} to upset the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
50|$|Gable-roof 17 ft (5.2 m) wide x 44 -103 ft (13.4 - 31.4 m) long, with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> as Class A, plus, at larger stations, ticket office, parcels room, lamp room, stationmaster's office, porters’ room, and postal room, {{mostly with}} {{fireplaces}} {{at the apex}} of the roof. e.g., Glenhope, Kaikoura, Kawakawa, Ohakune, Otaki, Pukekohe, Rangiora, Te Kuiti and Waihi.|$|R
50|$|The Evangelical {{parish in}} Selters has owned its own church since 1842. This building’s side wings also housed the Selters {{elementary}} school until 1958. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> are now {{used by the}} town administration. In 1850, the Evangelical parish got its first minister. In 1963, a kindergarten and a parish centre were dedicated. Since 2006, Mr. Wehrmann has been the one responsible for leading the parish.|$|R
5000|$|The former Heaton Grammar site (located on Jesmond Park West) {{became known}} as the Jesmond Site, whilst the former Manor Park site (located on Benton Road) {{became known as}} the Benton Site. The rooms on the Jesmond site had a J- prefix (e.g. J44, JP1, JD1) to {{distinguish}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> over on <b>the</b> Benton site which had a B- prefix (e.g. B75, BP2, BD1) ...|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of 11 October 1943, during World War II, Japanese forces bomb the Indian city of Madras (now Chennai). The next morning, Rajan, a radio {{engineer}} and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own hand gun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiah, having heard the gunshot, complains to the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death. Crime Investigation Department (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu {{to help with the}} investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene. However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because the amount of money at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room.</b> Rajan was about to leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings.|$|E
5|$|The House of Rohan {{owned the}} palace until the French Revolution, {{when it was}} confiscated, {{declared}} bien national ("state owned"), and finally auctioned off on 8August 1791. Bought by the municipality, it became the new town hall (hôtel deville) the same year, succeeding the Neubau. Much of the furniture {{and many of the}} works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops decorating the Salle des évêques (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed. They were replaced in 1796 by allegories of civic virtues painted by Joseph Melling. Only the portrait of Armand Gaston, the builder of the palace, was later restored to its original place with a 1982 replica of Hyacinthe Rigaud's lost painting. Melling also replaced the overdoor portraits of kings of France, decorating <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> with paintings of vases.|$|E
5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, {{but rather by}} several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), Scrubs composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. Marx and Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if {{it would be possible to}} get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The former Heaton Grammar site (located on Jesmond Park West) {{became known}} as the [...] "Jesmond Site", whilst the former Manor Park site (located on Benton Road) {{became known as}} the [...] "Benton Site".

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Sargent. It is {{in black and white}} and shows Dallas playing in different rooms, with scenes showing a woman in (what appears to be) some of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms,</b> but never at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as Dallas. The song is referenced in a Cancer Bats music video where a group of men (played by the band members, along with Alexisonfire vocalist George Pettit and producer Greg Below) sing the song at the end.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{design was}} {{developed}} by Hirsch Bedner Associates Design Consultants of Hong Kong during the 2006/7 renovations of the Garden Wing. Warner Wong Associates of Singapore renovated the rooms of the Tower Wing in 2003/4, while Leese Robertson Freeman of Hong Kong are currently renovating <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> for 2012/3. <b>The</b> hotel focuses on using local supplies and craftsmanship, such as the woodwork in the Summer Palace, designed by renowned Filipino artist-sculptor Claude Tayag.|$|R
5|$|The {{town was}} {{especially}} rich in literary associations {{during the late}} 19th century and earlier years of the 20th century. P. C. Wren author of Beau Geste, Frederick E. Smith, writer of the 633 Squadron books, and Beatrice Webb, later Potter, all lived in the town. Paul Verlaine taught at Bournemouth a preparatory school and the writer J. R. R. Tolkien, spent 30 years taking holidays in Bournemouth, staying in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> at the Hotel Miramar. He eventually retired to {{the area in the}} 1960s with his wife Edith, where they lived close to Branksome Chine. Tolkien died in September 1973 at his home in Bournemouth but was buried in Oxfordshire. The house was demolished in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the adopted {{daughter}} of Mr. Sanbourne and Ruby Lincoln and the adoptive sister of Eve Russell, who is Ruby's daughter {{from a previous}} marriage. Eve and Liz are both unaware of the adoption, believing that they were half-sisters. Mr. Sanbourne repeatedly molested Liz after Eve left home to be a nightclub singer, and a prostitute, and start a relationship with businessman Julian Crane. Liz blamed Eve for abandoning her to her father's sexual abuse. When she was fourteen, Liz went to Boston in search of Eve. She tracked down Julian at a jazz club {{to talk to him}} about her sister and their relationship. Later that night, Alistair Crane, Julian's father, raped Liz in his son's apartment; Julian was passed out in a drunken stupor in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> and was unaware of what happened. The rape resulted in Liz's pregnancy with Chad Harris-Crane, who was later believed to be Eve and Julian's son; Liz gave up her baby for adoption at birth, and was forced to undergo surgery that left her barren.|$|E
5|$|Nelson, the Hamiltons {{and several}} other British {{travellers}} left Leghorn for Florence on 13 July. They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name. By September they were in Prague, and later called at Dresden, Dessau and Hamburg, from where they caught a packet ship to Great Yarmouth, arriving on 6 November. Nelson was given a hero's welcome and after being sworn in as a freeman of the borough and received the massed crowd's applause. He subsequently {{made his way to}} London, arriving on 9 November. He attended court and was guest of honour at a number of banquets and balls. It was during this period that Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time. During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip. With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> as Fanny. Events came to a head around Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this.|$|E
50|$|Galbraith {{attended}} Smith College, spending {{her junior}} year at the Sorbonne, and obtaining her bachelor's degree in Romance languages from Smith in 1934. She then took graduate courses in German language at the University of Munich, where she lived in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rooming</b> house-dormitory as Unity Mitford, a girlfriend of Adolf Hitler. She was awarded a Master of Arts degree from Radcliffe College in 1936. Galbraith was fluent in Hindi and several other languages.|$|R
