5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E

The election, however, had taken place on 3 October 1998, on which date Hill was still a dual national.|$|E
5|$|Until the 19th century {{very little}} {{was known about}} hill forts, as none had been {{excavated}} and their original purpose had been long forgotten. In the medieval period, their construction was attributed variously to iconic figures such as King Arthur, King Alfred, the Danes, Julius Caesar, and even giants. By the 18th century, it was widely thought <b>that</b> <b>hill</b> forts were Roman in origin.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age <b>that</b> <b>hill</b> forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|Macartney's {{omission}} {{was part}} of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and selector Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player Peter McAlister objected and said <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, and came to a head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a selector.|$|E
5|$|The Weapons Platoon, after {{becoming}} {{separated from the}} rest of the company, encountered North Koreans on the trail it was following three times in the night, but in each instance neither side fired, each going on its way. At dawn, the platoon ambushed a group of North Koreans, killing 13 and capturing three North Koreans. From the body of a North Korean officer the men took a briefcase containing important documents and maps. These showed <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> 464 was an assembly point for part of the NK 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu.|$|E

5|$|The court {{declared}} <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did}} not declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|There {{are around}} 31hill forts in Dorset; {{archaeologist}} Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed <b>that</b> <b>hill</b> forts {{were used to}} control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings. Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.|$|E
5|$|Women who {{had trained}} under Hill formed the Association of Women Housing Workers in 1916. This later {{changed its name}} to the Society of Housing Managers in 1948. After merging with the Institute of Housing Managers in 1965, the society became the present day Chartered Institute of Housing in 1994. The CIH is a {{professional}} body for those working in the housing profession in the UK and overseas. The training <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> gave to Charity Organisation Society volunteers contributed to the development of modern social work, and COS continued to be instrumental in developing social work as a profession during the twentieth century. COS is still in operation today as the charity Family Action.|$|E

5|$|Clark was {{appointed}} {{chief executive officer}} of the Hill Samuel holding group in 1976 and was chairman from 1980 to 1988. Clark refused a takeover by Merrill Lynch, but after deregulation in 1986 he was convinced <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> Samuel was not large enough to compete and, facing hostile takeovers from Kerry Packer and FAI Insurances, arranged takeover talks first with UBS and then with TSB. TSB acquired Hill Samuel in 1988, and Clark became a director in 1987 and then deputy chairman in 1989 for two years. He was on the boards of many other companies, holding directorships at Eagle Star (1976 to 1987) Royal Dutch Shell (1982 to 1994), Vodafone (1988 to 1998), IMI (1981 to 1989) and Marley (1985 to 1989) – he later became the first non-family chairman of the latter. He served on the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration from 1979 to 1986 and was a trustee of the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School from 1981 to 1995. In 1982 he received an honorary Doctorate of Science from the Cranfield Institute of Technology. Clark {{was appointed}} vice-chairman of pharmaceutical firm SmithKline Beecham in 1987, a post he held for eight years. He was also chairman of the United Drapery Stores, where he was responsible for refusing a takeover bid from Heron Foods before accepting one made by Hanson plc.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher led by 66 {{points to}} 29 by the {{midpoint}} of the season. At the French Grand Prix, Frank Williams brought back Nigel Mansell, for the French, European, Japanese and Australian Grands Prix with Coulthard doing the majority of the 1994 season. Mansell earned approximately £900,000 for each of his four races, while Hill was paid £300,000 for the entire season, though Hill's position as lead driver remained unquestioned. Hill came back into contention for the title after winning the British Grand Prix, a race his father had never won. Schumacher was disqualified from that race and banned for two further races for overtaking Hill during the formation lap and ignoring the subsequent black flag. Four more victories for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was excluded or disqualified, took the title battle to the final event at Adelaide. At Schumacher's first race since his ban, the European Grand Prix, he suggested <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> (who was eight years his senior) was not a world-class driver. However, during the penultimate race at the Japanese Grand Prix, Hill took victory ahead of Schumacher in a rain-soaked event. This put Hill just one point behind the German before the last race of the season.|$|E
25|$|In a {{biography}} published in 2011, William M. Adler concludes <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> was probably innocent of murder, but also suggests <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> {{came to see}} himself as worth more to the labor movement as a dead martyr than he was alive, and that this understanding may have influenced his decisions not to testify at the trial and subsequently to spurn all chances of a pardon. Adler reports that evidence pointed to early police suspect Frank Z. Wilson, and cites Hilda Erickson's letter, which states <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> had {{told her he had}} been shot by her former fiance.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, the Robinson Hill {{case was}} the subject of Murder in Texas, a {{television}} film featuring Farrah Fawcett as Robinson Hill. It concurs with Kurth's theory <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> may have faked his death, suggesting that he arranged for someone else to be killed in his place. The journalist Jerry Buck noted in an article preceding the film's debut on NBC that the face of the shooting victim had been battered and that there were anomalies in the autopsy report, notably <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> had a different eye color from that recorded for the dead person. Buck also wrote <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> was in financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service in 1972 and facing a murder case against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and New York City.|$|E
25|$|Kurth {{published}} her {{own account}} of the case entitled Prescription Murder in which she repeated her claim <b>that</b> <b>Hill</b> had tried to kill her, and alleged {{that he may have}} poisoned his first wife with bacteria-laced pastries.
