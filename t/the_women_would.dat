5|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> serve their sentence {{in one of}} three provinces. The decision upon a general-security women's corrective labor colony (the most common type of prison in Russia) in the Republic of Mordovia, approximately 400 kilometers from Moscow, was later confirmed by Tolokonnikova's husband. The women asked authorities to let them serve their sentence at the pre-trial detention facility in Moscow. Their request was denied, and Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were then dispatched to penal colonies in Mordovia and Perm Oblast, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|Starting in Otley, {{the race}} headed east towards Harewood, where <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> tackle the first {{categorised}} climb {{of the day}} – the 1.2km Côte de Harwood averaging 5% in gradient. The race would continue east, heading through East Keswick taking on the second classified climb of the day – the Côte de East Rigton. The second climb was slightly shorter, at 0.8km, but boasted a steeper average gradient of 8.2%. The race now headed south, to the intermediate sprint point in Scholes. After the sprint point, the route would take the riders south east, to Sherburn-in-Elmet, then south to Knottingley. After passing through Pontefract the route headed south through Wentbridge, South Elmsall and Hooton Pagnell. After skirting round the westerly side of Doncaster the riders would go through the second intermediate sprint point at Warmsworth and would almost immediately tackle the final and shortest classified climb of the day, the 0.5km 6.5% Côte de Conisbrough Castle. The final stages of the race saw the route pass through Tickhill and Bawtry before heading north to finish line in Doncaster.|$|E

25|$|His son left London in {{the early}} 1930s to study in the yeshiva of Kelm. He would not rejoin his family; during the war they would escape to the Far East, and {{eventually}} settled in the United States. Several months before the outbreak of World War II, his wife left for Lithuania with her daughter to visit relatives. The war would separate them, and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> spend the war mainly in Australia.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to food and other necessities of life the band worked together. The men would hunt the buffalo by driving them into pounds or corrals to be killed or they would be stampeded off cliffs. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> collect edible roots and berries but they would also {{preserve}} the food and build tools for everyday life. The band worked together so everyone would have enough food. If there were shortages on food the band would split into smaller bands so they had {{a better chance to}} survive.|$|E
25|$|In general these {{gathering}}s {{would involve}} older women, usually post-menopausal, gathering together {{in order to}} punish individuals of the community for offense such as being accused of witchcraft, falsely accusing others of witchcraft, physically abusing family members or pregnant women, incest, or committing other offenses. In the precolonial situation, these practices were very local, never extended outside of a single ethnic community, and established clear remedies for the individuals targeted (typically begging for forgiveness from the women, paying a fine, and being ritually cleansed). The older women gather {{at the house of}} the individual being targeted, sing and chant, and behave in ways which are typically against decorum (including stripping, defecating and urinating on the person’s property, sexual harassment and puns directed at passersby, dressing in male attire, etc.) in order to express the severity of the offense. In Kedjom Keku communities, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> be led by comedians (called vugweys) who would lead the group in making vulgar jokes and puns at those passing by and the individual being shamed. In Kom communities, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> be led by the oldest women in the community, called na-anlu (mother of anlu) {{for the duration of the}} shaming, who was in charge of organizing the various efforts.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would card the fibre — break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> then spin these rough rovings into yarn wound on a spindle. The male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun to bleach it. The invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.|$|E
25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya {{points out that}} when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women {{would have to be}} able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E
25|$|Traditional anlu, {{similar to}} fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku {{communities}} and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe, involves {{groups of women}} organizing and shaming individuals who violate certain moral rules. The ostracizing could develop {{as a result of}} any set of offenses that violated community morality and were believed to threaten the life of the community (by damaging fertility, food, or prosperity). These offenses could include insulting one's mother, physically abusing a pregnant or nursing woman, committing incest, or other offenses. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> respond with actions considered outside of the communities moral order (vulgar speech, display of genitals, dress in men's clothing, defecation on the offender's property, etc.) in order to highlight the egregiousness of the offense and pressure for repayment. The women themselves are organized under the leadership of the oldest woman of the community, named the na-anlu.|$|E

25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, one or more of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story {{that had nothing to do}} with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|E
25|$|As the air-defences of Helsinki were {{improved}} in spring 1944 after the winter bombings {{it was decided}} to replace some of the personnel in searchlight units with women to ease manpower shortage. Three hundred women were selected from students working already in air surveillance duties, of whom 215 arrived for searchlight training. The trainees were mainly from Helsinki University of Technology, University of Helsinki and Ateneum, but also from schools in Turku and Tampere. The training began on 31 May 1944 in Laajasalo in Helsinki, but was suspended already on 9 June since there was no guarantee that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> continue to serve after fall (student work responsibility only covered summer months). The training continued after the women expressed interest in the task and pledged to serve {{for as long as the}} war demanded or a minimum of one year. After this the number of trainees was set at 145 and the training was concentrated to Anti-aircraft regiment 1 (Finnish: Ilmatorjuntarykmentti 1 (ItR 1)) in Helsinki, while the training in 1st Independent Anti-aircraft Battalion (Finnish: 1. Erillinen ilmatorjuntapatteristo (1.Er.ItPsto)) in Turku and 2nd Independent Anti-aircraft Battalion (Finnish: 2. Erillinen ilmatorjuntapatteristo (2.Er.ItPsto)) in Tampere was discontinued. Captain K. H. Pentti led the training while Inkeri Simola acted as the Lotta leader. Simola was later succeeded by Aino Airamo. A voluntary written commitment to remain in service as well as passing a medical examination for continuous outdoor duty was required from the women who wished to serve in the searchlight battery.|$|E

Debbi Voller, author of Madonna: The Style Book, observed that [...] "Hundreds of thousands of young girls came to the concert dressed like her, with bleached and tousled hair, see-through tops, bras, fingerless gloves and crucifixes. Magazines and TV shows ran lookalike competitions." [...] This frenzy regarding Madonna {{gave rise to a}} new term called Madonna wannabe—a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the Webster's Dictionary in May 1991.

[...] They picketed outside every Monday and Wednesday {{in the hopes that}} they could gain more media attention and support for the miners.

In More Than a Uniform, Winifred Quick Collins (former WAVE officer) described Director McAfee as a born diplomat, handling difficult matters with finesse. She also said McAfee played an important decision making role on how the women of the WAVES should be treated compared to the men, what kind of assignments <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> take, housing conditions, and supervision and discipline standards.|$|E
