5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick {{walls of the}} <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Crossrail project, to {{construct}} a new underground railway line through central London, will have one of its new stations at Liverpool Street. A new <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> serving the Crossrail station will be built within the old Underground <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> with its entrance at 100 Liverpool Street, the old entrance to the Underground that served Broad Street, with the platforms themselves under the Broadgate complex.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} Charles Holden {{designed for the}} extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, {{glass and reinforced concrete}} and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> of brick and glass panels rises from a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The centre of the <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December 1946 the {{passenger}} line was extended eastwards {{as part of}} the war-delayed London Passenger Transport Board's New Works Programme. An Underground <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> was added in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{previous}} BS stations, {{a separate}} station building was not constructed at Paddington. A small pedestrian entrance on the north-west {{corner of the}} junction of London Street and Praed Street provides access to the below-ground <b>ticket</b> <b>hall.</b> Following their successful introduction at Earl's Court in 1911, the station was the first {{on the line to}} be designed to use escalators instead of lifts. The <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> and platforms are decorated with tiling designs by David Hamilton installed during a £6 million refurbishment of the station between 1984 and 1987 incorporating elements of technical drawings by Marc Isambard Brunel and other engineers.|$|E

25|$|Following {{completion}} of the station upgrade in 2010, Kings Cross St Pancras now has eleven entrances and four <b>ticket</b> <b>halls.</b>|$|R
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{building}} has escalators. To get from either <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> to the platforms {{it is necessary}} to use the lifts or spiral stairs. The southern {{building has}} lifts from street level down {{to the level of the}} southbound Northern line platform, the only step-free platform at the station.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding was a {{major problem}} at many {{stations}} where interchanges were made with other Underground lines and efforts were made {{in a number of}} places to improve passenger movements. In 1914, work was carried out to provide larger ticket halls and install escalators at Oxford Circus, Embankment and Baker Street. In 1923, further work at Oxford Circus provided a combined Bakerloo and CLR <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> and added more escalators serving the CLR platforms. In 1926, Trafalgar Square and Waterloo received escalators, the latter in conjunction with expansion of the station as part of the CCE's extension to Kennington. Between 1925 and 1928, Piccadilly Circus station saw the greatest reconstruction. A large circular <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> was excavated below the road junction with multiple subway connections from points around the Circus and two flights of escalators down to the Bakerloo and Piccadilly platforms were installed.|$|E
50|$|The station {{contains}} <b>ticket</b> <b>halls,</b> gates, escalators, payphones, {{toilets and}} a Wifi service. It also has cash machines, dispensing pounds sterling and euros.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} 4 payphones (two on the {{platforms}} {{and two in}} the <b>ticket</b> <b>halls),</b> 7 gates, a Wifi service, 5 vending machines and a photo booth.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Crevier, Lemieux, Mercier and Caron, it is {{a normal}} side {{platform}} station built in open cut under boul. De Maisonneuve, with two <b>ticket</b> <b>halls</b> joined by corridors that surround the platforms. The <b>ticket</b> <b>halls</b> {{are linked to the}} platforms by four stairways per platform, including the shortest escalators in the network. The station has large pillars, which were originally painted orange, but painted in beer bottle green color in the late 1990s. In January 2010 the STM repainted the station in its original colors being orange pillars and yellow walls.|$|R
5|$|The {{station has}} a single large concourse, {{separate}} from the train shed. Originally, there were no seats installed there to deter vagrants and crime, but these were added following complaints from passengers. A few remnants of the older station remain: two Portland stone entrance lodges and a war memorial. A statue of Robert Stephenson by Carlo Marochetti, previously in the old <b>ticket</b> <b>hall,</b> stands in the forecourt.|$|E
5|$|Between April and August 2016 the Bakerloo line {{platforms}} {{were closed}} to enable escalator replacements {{and the construction}} of connecting passageways to the new Crossrail platforms due to open in 2018. In December 2016 Westminster City Council approved proposals to construct a new mixed-use development called Paddington Quarter on a site adjacent to the mainline station. The plans include reconstruction of the Bakerloo line station to provide a larger <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> and better access between platforms and street level.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 1920s, Holden {{designed}} {{a series of}} replacement buildings and new façades for station improvements around the UERL's network. Many of these featured Portland stone cladding and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension. At Piccadilly Circus, {{one of the busiest}} stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} by Xianfeng East Road, in Xishan, Wuxi. The station offers two <b>ticket</b> <b>halls</b> (north and south), four platforms, and daily {{services}} of trains to major cities in China.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the close}} {{proximity}} of the CLR, W&CR and C&SLR stations, and the non-competing directions of their services, their <b>ticket</b> <b>halls</b> were soon connected, but connection between the CLR and C&SLR platforms were made only when escalators were installed in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Bellvitge metro {{station is}} located under Rambla de la Marina {{and can be}} {{accessed}} {{from both sides of}} the road. The station entrances access two underground <b>ticket</b> <b>halls,</b> which in turn give access to two 96 m long side platforms on a lower level.|$|R
5|$|In 1931, an {{extension}} to Camberwell was approved {{as part of}} the London Electric Metropolitan District and Central London Railway Companies (Works) Act, 1931. The route was to follow Walworth Road and Camberwell Road south from Elephant and Castle, with stations at Albany Road and under Denmark Hill road at Camberwell. Elephant & Castle station was to be reconstructed with a third platform, a new <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> and escalators. However, financial constraints prevented any work from being started.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Transport for London {{published}} outline proposals {{prepared by}} architects BuckleyGrayYeoman for a redevelopment {{of the buildings}} {{to the west of}} the station arcade and in Thurloe Street and space to the south of the station cutting on Pelham Street. The proposal includes bringing the disused northern platform back into use for eastbound trains, a new entrance to Thurloe Street, a reconfigured <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> and provision of step-free access throughout the station.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace the lifts with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. The lifts were removed and a spacious new <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> was provided giving access to a bank of four escalators down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{the main}} <b>ticketing</b> <b>hall</b> was {{expanded}} to the east, providing 13 additional ticketing counters {{and a new}} security checkpoint; Concourse D was expanded by an additional nine gates. That year, US Airways began service to Costa Rica, Mexico City, and St. Kitts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ticketing</b> <b>hall</b> {{overlooks the}} {{international}} departures concourse, {{and the two}} are separated by a glass partition. During Kansai's early days, visitors were known to throw objects over the partition to friends in the corridor below. The partition was eventually modified to halt this practice.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} <b>ticket</b> <b>halls.</b> Two are {{operated}} by ScotRail (main concourse and Argyle Street entrance) {{and the third}} is a travel centre run by Virgin Trains at the Gordon Street entrance. Virgin Trains also operate a dedicated customer lounge next to Platform 1 and a First Class lounge.|$|R
5|$|The Central {{line station}} opened on 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo line station on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve {{congestion}}. Further congestion {{led to another}} reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made {{as part of the}} New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new <b>ticket</b> <b>hall</b> was built. The Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, including cross-platform interchange with the Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{connected}} Underground stations at Victoria, {{on different}} levels and built {{more than a}} century apart. The older one, {{on the north side of}} the bus station, serves the District and Circle lines, constructed by 'cut and cover' methods just below road level. The newer station, closer to the main line station, serves the Victoria line, a deep-level tube. Each has its own <b>ticket</b> <b>hall,</b> and the two are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the bus station.|$|E
5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line <b>ticket</b> <b>hall,</b> three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. This will be done {{in conjunction with the}} major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create thousands of new homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{was built}} in 1981, and the coastline of the terminal was 1,025m long, there were 16 berths, and covered an area of 25,371m2. It had two <b>ticket</b> <b>halls,</b> three waiting halls (two for HK-Macau line, and one for domestic line) and six service counters for pre-check in.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>ticket</b> <b>halls.</b> Two are {{operated}} by ScotRail (main concourse and Argyle Street entrance) {{and the third}} is a travel centre run by Virgin Trains at the Gordon Street entrance. Virgin Trains also operate a dedicated customer lounge next to Platform 1 and a First Class lounge.|$|R
50|$|The fourth, and current, {{station was}} {{designed}} by Harry Reijnders and completed in 1996. Consisting of a white lattice structure, a curved, shell-like entrance leads into a <b>ticketing</b> <b>hall</b> lined with shops and restaurants. When first built, the floor had a bright blue and white finish. Problems with passengers slipping required that the floor be replaced with standard tiling.|$|R
