5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
25|$|Redcliffe Baseball {{club was}} founded {{as a senior}} club in 1948 by an American {{ex-serviceman}} named Chuck Carroll and was later named the Redcliffe Whitesox. Younger kids played at Redcliffe Police Citizens Youth Club then went elsewhere if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. Redcliffe Baseball Club had no direct feeder clubs from junior PCYC. In 1991 the PCYC could not support baseball anymore and the seniors wanted feeder clubs to support them so they joined forces at the Silcock Street oval and named themselves the Peninsula Padres – based on the San Diego Padres.|$|E

Their success was being noticed outside England and in due course the AIF Sports Control Board received a telegram from the South African government in Pretoria asking if the team could tour South Africa en route to Australia. The players held a meeting and were unanimous in their refusal as <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> straight home once their tour of England was completed. However, the Australian Army thought differently and the Ministry of Defence ordered them, as serving officers and other ranks, to comply. Planning began for a tour of South Africa from October to December.|$|E

Tamera had tried out for the role previously; she {{said that it was}} common for them to read for the same part, but emphasized that [...] " [...] very different actors". When she saw the two women together, Brock Akil initially debated whether they would be appropriate for the show's tone. She was concerned about the sisters' wholesome image gained from their years as child actors on the sitcom Sister, Sister, explaining, [...] "I had a certain image of them.

[...] After the album was released, Severson showed it to Roadrunner Records A man, Mike Gitter.|$|E

500|$|When {{ending the}} second season, the {{producers}} and crew {{thought it would}} be the last. However, to their surprise Millennium was renewed for a third season. Many of the cliffhanger plot threads from the season finale were written off as the hallucinations of Frank Black. When creating the third season, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the stand alone storytelling format used in the first season; to do so they had Frank join the FBI and receive a new [...] "skeptical" [...] partner with whom he could work.

When asked the concept behind the video, Webb said: [...] "They provided the sound and I provided the lights. A whole lot of lights. We used {{the same guy who}} did the lighting setup for Lenny Kravitz's 'Are You Gonna Go My Way?' and Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound.' But it's also rough around the edges — we used a bunch of different processes when developing the film." [...] He also concluded with, [...] "...it's a big performance video. But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks. There's a big light wall, streaks of light, xenon lighting effects and strobe lights. [...] But it's all wrapped around this very simple performance environment".|$|E
500|$|On May 7, 1972, Kemper {{was driving}} in Berkeley {{when he picked}} up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University.

Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he [...] "brushed the back of [...] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [...] " [...] before adding that [...] " [...] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" [...] after grazing her breast, despite murdering her merely minutes later.|$|E

500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by {{a friend of the}} band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Vajna left Carolco {{and sold}} his {{interests}} to Kassar. [...] "After Rambo, {{we were trying}} to become a major studio. I felt that was the wrong direction," [...] Vajna told Entertainment Weekly. [...] "My feelings were very negative and it caused a lot of friction between Mario, myself, and Peter (Hoffman), who was by then Mario's right hand. I disagreed with where <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and Peter played our egos against each other. He wanted to be a partner." [...] Kassar and Vajna's partnership had fallen apart that year, and the latter was paid approximately $100 million for his share in the company. [...] Kassar carried on with Peter Hoffman, who was president/chief executive of Carolco at the time since 1986.

2500|$|Structure {{was what}} Allen {{brought to the}} {{screenplay}} for Bob Fosse's Cabaret. The producers hadn't wanted to film the stage script by Joe Masteroff and John Van Druten, and felt that not portraying the male lead as a homosexual was dishonest to the story. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Christopher Isherwood's original novel Goodbye to Berlin of 1939, but the Berlin stories weren't structured in any linear fashion and Allen had to diagram the entire story. Allen and Fosse got along badly from the start: she found him [...] "so depressed that it took two hours just to get him {{in the frame of}} mind for work." [...] In Allen's opinion most of the humor from the original was lost; she believed Fosse didn't really like the lead character of Sally Bowles at all. She worked on the screenplay for ten months, but in the end Fosse and the producers were still unhappy with the final form, and having commitments elsewhere, Allen handed the script over to her friend Hugh Wheeler.|$|E
