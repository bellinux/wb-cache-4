5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of her life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify <b>the</b> {{characteristics}} of <b>house</b> designs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly and disabled. We devised a method <b>for</b> characterizing <b>the</b> plans of new houses and compared examples of new <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled and ordinary non-adapted <b>houses</b> in <b>the</b> Hokkaido region of Japan. We examined 65 <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled and 70 ordinary non-adapted <b>houses.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the proportion of corridor type designs, in which there are two lines of flow in the bedroom, was significantly more in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled. In addition, more classifications were needed to categorize <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled, some of which contained a toilet and/or bathroom for exclusive use by the disabled member of the household. 本研究の目的は，高齢者・障害者同居住宅の平面構成の特性を明らかにすることである。そのために，住宅平面の類型化を用いた手法を新たに考案し，北海道内の新築事例から障害者住宅と一般住宅とを比較検討した。得られたサンプル数は障害者住宅が 65 ，一般住宅が 70 だった。その結果，障害者住宅は，一般住宅に比べて本人の寝室に 2 つの動線をもつ「回廊型」が有意に多いことが示された。また，障害者住宅は類型化した全てのタイプに分散され，さらにトイレ・浴室が本人専用であることから疑似型が生じた。従って，障害者住宅の平面特性として「回廊型」が多く，多様性であることが示唆される...|$|R

His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.|$|E
5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down {{a few months after}} they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E

Figure Museum is another historical colonial building since 1886 which ever become <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Johor first Menteri Besar Jaafar Mohamed; it is located on the top of Smile Hill (Bukit Senyum) overlooking the Johor Straits. The English College (now Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar) established in 1914 was located close to the Sungai Chat Palace before being moved to its present location at Sungai Chat Road; some of the ruins are visible at the old site. The Sultan Ibrahim Building is another historical building in the city; built in 1936 by British architect Palmer and Turner, it was the centre of the administration of Johor as since the relocation from Telok Blangah in Singapore, the Johor government never had its own building. Before the current railway station was built, there was Johor Bahru railway station (formerly Wooden Railway) which has now been turned into a museum after serving for 100 years since the British colonial era.|$|E

After a few drinks, they decide to dig up the backyard together, quickly finding another bone and a license plate. Phil, who is skeptical about the digging, leaves with Adam and Paul as Alicia (Anna Kendrick), Max (Brie Larson) and Billy (Chris Messina) arrive at the house. Billy pairs off with Alicia and Ray with Max while Tim continues to dig. He finds a shoe before deciding to go to sleep.|$|E

5|$|Bevin {{was sworn}} into a {{four-year}} term as Kentucky Governor on December 8, 2015. Observers {{from both parties}} praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, as Secretary of the Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as his Secretary of Labor. The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats from Democrats. Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by newly elected Auditor Mike Harmon and newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections. Republicans held only Harmon's seat, giving Democrats a 53–47 advantage in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the session.|$|E
