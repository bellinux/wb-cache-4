5|$|The {{introduction}} of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France {{over a period of}} ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.|$|E
5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in the front row.|$|E
5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and pushed their players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try to preserve their lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in an effort to find the goal they needed; their best chance came four minutes from the end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E

5|$|David decides <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> {{opposing}} the Conqueror {{in hopes of}} earning independence for Athlum, which is currently a vassal state {{to the city of}} Celapaleis. The party succeeds in stopping the Conqueror's army from attacking Celapaleis, but the Conqueror himself attacks Athlum in their absence. He kills Emma, who had remained behind to defend the city and takes the massive Remnant of Athlum, shrinking it to a normal-sized sword. The party then returns to Elysion to rescue Irina from Wagram. Irina is revealed to have a special power, that of unbinding bound Remnants, and it was for this reason that she was kidnapped. They discover that Hermeien is trying to use the Conqueror and Wagram to spark distrust in the people for Remnants and the city-states' ability to control them, so that he can then use Irina and her power to prop himself up as supreme ruler. While the party are successful in retaking Irina and killing Hermeien, Wagram escapes while revealing that he and the Conqueror never planned to support Hermeien. Confronted by the Conqueror, Irina uses Nagapur's Remnant to protect her brother, destroying half of the city in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom of}} the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Conference Final began {{between the}} Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers on May 9. Malkin scored with 7seconds {{left in the}} first period to take a 3–2 lead, and {{extended}} the advantage with a shorthanded goal in the second period, giving the Penguins a 1–0 advantage in the series after Game 1. In Game 2, Talbot scored <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the third period, and Staal added an empty-net goal to give the Penguins a 4–2 win and a 2–0 series lead. The win was the Penguins' seventh consecutive home playoff win, a franchise record, improving on a six-game streak in the 1992 playoffs. The Penguins also became only the fifth team to start the playoffs with a 10–1 record, and the first since the Detroit Red Wings in 1995. Game 3 saw the series move across state to Philadelphia; the Penguins struck quickly with goals from Ryan Whitney and Hossa within the first eight minutes. Hossa added his second goal on an empty net to seal the victory. With the win, the Penguins become the first team since the 1983 Edmonton Oilers to start the playoffs 11–1. The Penguins failed to close out the Eastern Conference Finals with a sweep of the Flyers in Game 4, losing 4–2. The Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in the first period. The Penguins fought back getting two goals from Jordan Staal in the third period, but Joffrey Lupul's second goal on an empty net sealed the win for the Flyers. The series returned to Pittsburgh for Game 5, where the Penguins won their eighth consecutive home game by a final score of 6–0, the Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Final.|$|E

An independent ministry was formed with A. Ranganatha Mudaliar and R. N. Arogyaswamy Mudaliar as the second and third ministers. The Justice Party took the place of an opposition.|$|E

At the halfway point they were tied for first, one-and-a-half points ahead of Kramnik and Svidler. In the second half Kramnik, who had drawn his first seven games, became a serious contender after scoring four wins, while Aronian lost three games, and was thus left behind in the race. Carlsen started the second half by staying ahead of the field, but a loss to Ivanchuk allowed Kramnik <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> round 12 by defeating Aronian.

25|$|In {{addition}} to pursuing {{a wide variety}} of local issues, I have attempted to question, probe and scrutinise the Government in the House of Commons on important national and international topics which concern people.

The plight of the people of Darfur, Western Sudan, has also been a regular theme. They have suffered too much for too long with too little done about the situation.
