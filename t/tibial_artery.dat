40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{determine}} interobserver {{variation in the}} measurement of Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) and grading of disease by means of Duplex scanning (DS) in the popliteal, <b>tibial</b> and pedal <b>arteries.</b> DESIGN: prospective validation study. MATERIALS: twenty-four consecutive patients with severe claudication (n= 6), ischaemic rest pain (n= 11) and tissue loss (n= 7). METHODS: two vascular technologists independently examined the popliteal, <b>tibial</b> and pedal <b>arteries.</b> The PSV was recorded in 15 arterial segments that were graded with B-mode and Doppler parameters as fully patent, severely diseased or occluded. Concordance in PSV recordings was expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Agreement in artery assessment was expressed as weighted kappa-values. RESULTS: the ICC for PSV measurements was 0. 90 (95 % CI, 0. 86 to 0. 93) within the popliteal and <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> and 0. 64 (95 % CI, 0. 37 to 0. 81) within the pedal arteries. Agreement for grading disease was good within the popliteal and <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> (kappa 0. 66, 95 % CI, 0. 58 to 0. 74), and moderate within the pedal arteries (kappa 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 33 to 0. 74). The presence of diabetes or stage of disease did not influence interobserver agreement.

40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{examined}} whether preoperative duplex {{ultrasound scanning}} (DU) could replace contrast material–enhanced arteriography (CA) in selecting the recipient <b>artery</b> of <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>artery</b> bypass grafts. MethodsIn patients who underwent <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>artery</b> bypass grafting because of critical ischemia, images were obtained {{of the lower}} extremity arterial circulation with both DU and CA. Vascular surgeons, blinded to the operation performed, reviewed either DU or CA images for arterial visualization and patency. The <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>artery</b> best suited to receive the bypass graft was selected by surgeons using only data from either DU or CA images. This selection was compared with the artery actually used at bypass surgery. ResultsPreoperative DU and CA data for 40 lower extremities in 38 patients undergoing bypass grafting {{at the level of}} the tibia provided 110 arteries: 38 anterior <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries,</b> 32 peroneal arteries, and 40 posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Ten arteries (8 peroneal, 2 anterior tibial) were not identified with DU, and 1 <b>artery</b> (anterior <b>tibial)</b> was not identified with CA. DU enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 88 % of patients (35 of 40), whereas CA enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 93 % of patients (37 of 40; P =. 59). Duplicate findings at DU and CA enabled selection of 85 % of arteries actually used (95 % confidence interval, 71 %- 93 %). Arteries used for bypass grafting had significantly higher peak systolic velocity (35 cm/s vs 25 cm/s; P =. 04), higher end-diastolic velocity (15 cm/s vs 9 cm/s; P =. 005), and greater diameter (2. 4 mm vs 1. 7 mm; P =. 003) compared with arteries not selected for bypass grafting. ConclusionFindings at DU and CA typically agree when used to select <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>arteries</b> for bypass grafting. With DU there is occasional difficulty in identification of the peroneal artery, but selection of the actual artery used is accurate. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and diameter characteristics correlate with arteriographic criteria for <b>tibial</b> bypass target <b>artery</b> selection. If DU enables adequate identification of a target artery for bypass grafting, and especially if the peroneal artery is seen, findings at CA are not likely to alter bypass execution...|$|R

40|$|Autogenous {{saphenous vein}} {{has been the}} {{material}} of choice for small-vessel angioplasty and for circulatory access graft reconstruction. In an effort to conserve autogenous saphenous vein, we used expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in 45 patients over a 12 -month period. We used Gore-Tex* to reconstruct 17 circulatory access grafts, 16 carotid arteries, two brachial arteries, seven femoral arteries, and three popliteal anterior or posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> The indications for reconstruction were chronic occlusion of the access grafts, trauma to the brachial and anterior <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries,</b> and atherosclerotic disease of the carotid, femoral, and popliteal-tibial arteries. Of the reconstructed circulatory access grafts, one failed immediately because of technical problems in the conduit, and one failed 11 months after reconstruction. All other grafts have functioned well and have produced a marked improvement in flow. Of the 28 patients who underwent reconstruction of arteries measuring 3 mm or less, two had patent arteries but died shortly after operation. The remaining 26 have been followed for one to 43 months. All reconstructed arteries are patent, {{and there have been}} no instances of distal embolization or false aneurysm formation...|$|R
