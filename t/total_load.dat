5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to <b>total</b> <b>load</b> or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

30|$|The average {{long-term}} annual {{water discharge}} of PRB comprises 3300 hm 3. For assessing and documenting {{the status of}} surface waters of PRB, 73 river water bodies have been identified. As Pinios River surface waters are only used locally for feeding irrigation needs, 57 are characterized by low river water abstraction, 7 by medium water abstraction and only 9 by high water abstraction. In terms of pollution, Pinios river water quality is stressed by the discharge of treated and untreated domestic and industrial effluent and agricultural return flows (Loukas 2010). According to the recently revised water management plan, in terms of nitrogen loads and BOD, inputs from non-point (diffuse) sources are dominating (70 and 82 % of the <b>total</b> <b>loads,</b> respectively), while concerning P, 32 % of the <b>total</b> <b>loads</b> are attributed to non-point sources.|$|R

40|$|Competition between {{parasite}} genotypes in genetically diverse infections is widespread. However, {{experimental evidence}} on how genetic diversity influences <b>total</b> parasite <b>load</b> is variable. Here we use an additive partition equation {{to quantify the}} negative effect of inter-genotypic competition on <b>total</b> parasite <b>load</b> in diverse infections. Our approach controls for extreme-genotype effects, a process that can potentially neutralise, or even reverse, the negative effect of competition on <b>total</b> parasite <b>load.</b> A single extreme-genotype can have a disproportionate effect on <b>total</b> parasite <b>load</b> if it causes the highest parasite load in its single-infection, while increasing its performance in diverse relative to single infections. We show that in theory such disproportionate effects of extreme-genotypes {{can lead to a}} higher <b>total</b> parasite <b>load</b> in diverse infections than expected, even if competition reduces individual parasite performance on average. Controlling for the extreme-genotype effect is only possible if the competition effect on <b>total</b> parasite <b>load</b> is measured appropriately as the average difference between the realised number of each parasite genotype in mixed infections and the expected number based on single infection parasite loads. We apply this approach to sticklebacks that were experimentally infected with different trematode genotypes. On average, genetically diverse infections had lower parasite loads than expected from single-infection results. For the first time we demonstrate that competition between co-infecting genotypes per se caused the parasite load reduction, while extreme-genotype effects were not significant. We thus suggest that to correctly quantify the effect of competition alone on <b>total</b> parasite <b>load</b> in genetically diverse infections, the extreme-genotype effect has to be controlled for...|$|R
