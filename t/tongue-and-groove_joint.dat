40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{summarize}} the results of all wood airplane wing beams tested to date in the Bureau of Standards Laboratory in order that the various kinds of wood and methods of construction may be compared. All beams tested were of an I section and the majority were somewhat similar in size and cross section to the front wing beam of the Curtiss JN- 4 machine. Construction methods may be classed as (1) solid beams cut from solid stock; (2) three-piece beams, built up of three pieces, web and flanges glued together by a <b>tongue-and-groove</b> <b>joint</b> and (3) laminated beams built up of thin laminations of wood glued together...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{evaluation}} of local stresses in the adhesive and adherends is presented for a <b>tongue-and-groove</b> <b>joint</b> of a homogenized thick composite laminate to steel plate. The quasi-isotropic laminate {{is made of}} glass fabric/vinyl ester plies. Most results are obtained for elastic response of the Dexter-Hysol 9338 adhesive {{that was used in}} recent experiments (Compos Sci Technol 61 (2001) 1123 â€“ 1142). A non-linearly viscoelastic adhesive is also considered, with illustrative properties taken from experiments on the FM- 73 system. Both in-plane force resultants and out-of-plane moments are included in the applied loads. Scaling of the elastic results with regard to plate thickness shows that for given levels of overall stresses applied to the adherend plates, the stresses supported by the adhesive do not depend on plate thickness. Adhesive stress relaxation is shown to be relatively small, and occurring in a short time period...|$|E
50|$|Chamferboards are an Australian form of {{weatherboarding}} using <b>tongue-and-groove</b> <b>joints</b> to {{link the}} boards together to give a flatter external appearance than regular angled weatherboards.|$|R
50|$|The school {{building}} is a simple structure of timber with a corrugated iron hipped roof truncated where a skillion-roofed verandah has been added on its western side. The building sits on low timber stumps and a small set of stairs {{on the eastern side}} gains entrance to the classroom. The walls are timber <b>tongue-and-groove</b> vertical <b>joints</b> and the schoolroom has sliding 6 pane windows on three walls. The room has a coved timber ceiling with a central lattice vent and a large timber support beam across the width of the room. The room contains some of its original desks and chairs dating from 1946 as well as other original pieces such as framed embroidery by former students.|$|R
