5|$|Data {{determines that}} the only way to restore the realities is to send Worf via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise of his universe, passing through the fissure and using the shuttlecraft's engines to reseal it. After {{locating}} the correct ship, Worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another Enterprise that has come from a Borg-overrun universe, its crew refusing to return. The Enterprise that he left fires upon the hostile ship and destroys it. Worf safely passes through the fissure, finding himself back in normality with a single Enterprise in front of him. After boarding, Worf finds that no <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> since he initially entered the fissure. When he returns to his room expecting a surprise party, he finds only Troi waiting to give him a single present and, knowing that the two are married in many alternate universes, he invites her to share dinner with him.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, US12 was {{dedicated}} to the 32nd Infantry Division. The division used a red arrow as its insignia to symbolize how they pierced the German Hindenburg Line during World War I and Japanese defenses during World War II. The soldiers who composed the division were drawn from the Michigan and Wisconsin National Guards. After other proposals failed, US12 was named the Red Arrow Highway on August 30, 1952, and dedicated on March 22, 1953. Jurisdiction {{of most of the}} roadways that composed US12 at that <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> to local governments as I-94 was built, but the highway still bears that name in Berrien County.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E

5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
25|$|Fig. 2-10 {{reinforces}} previous {{discussions about}} mutual time dilation. In this figure, Events A and C {{are separated from}} event O by equal timelike intervals. From the unprimed frame, events A and B are measured as simultaneous, but more <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> for the unprimed observer than has passed for the primed observer. From the primed frame, events C and D are measured as simultaneous, but more <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> for the primed observer than has passed for the unprimed observer. Each observer measures the clocks of the other observer as running more slowly.|$|E

25|$|A water clock uses a flow {{of water}} to measure time. If {{viscosity}} is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is Torricelli's law. There {{are two types of}} water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and tell how much <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed.</b> An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell how much <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rearing is {{also another}} method {{that can bring}} the most rewards. This {{can be done with}} wild host eggs or laboratory-prepared host eggs that are exposed in {{suitable}} habitats outside. They can then be taken in after a sufficient amount of <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> and examined for developing fairyflies. With this method, it is possible to observe the life history and determine the hosts of particular species of discovered fairyflies.|$|E

25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US. The primary symptom of asbestosis is generally the slow onset of shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Clinically advanced cases of asbestosis may lead to respiratory failure. When a physician listens with a stethoscope to the lungs of a person with asbestosis, they may hear inspiratory crackles.|$|E
25|$|Bite mark {{analysis}} is also controversial because dental profiles {{are subject to}} change. The loss of teeth or the alteration of arch configuration {{through a variety of}} procedures is common in human populations. The onset of oral diseases such as dental caries has been shown to alter the arch and tooth configuration and {{must be taken into account}} when comparing a dental profile to the bite mark after a significant amount of <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> since the mark was made.|$|E
25|$|As <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed,</b> {{the sample}} has dwindled. As of 2003, {{there were over}} 200 members of the sample still alive. The study is to {{continue}} until the final member of the sample either withdraws or dies. In the 21st century researchers continue to publish articles based on the data collected in the Genetic Studies of Genius. For example, one article found that men who skipped a grade in childhood had higher incomes throughout adulthood, a finding that has been replicated in more modern samples.|$|E

5000|$|Malcolm Bradbury {{found that}} {{approaching}} the new series [...] "brings a tear {{to the eye}} and a smile to the lips"; a tear because <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> the culturally-significant original by, but smile because investment in a classic project is good.|$|R

25|$|The final scene's snowy {{landscape}} was filmed in New Zealand. The ending is deliberately ambiguous, {{and the audience}} is left with several questions: specifically, how much <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed,</b> if Dae-Su's meeting with the hypnotist really took place, whether he successfully lost the knowledge of Mi-do's identity, and whether he will continue his relationship with Mi-do. In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), {{he says that the}} ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely up to each individual viewer to interpret what isn't shown.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{notation}} (melekket) {{used for the}} chants, is not a typical notational system since it does not represent pitch or melody. Rather, it is as a mnemonic. Most studies conclude {{that there has been}} impressive consistency since the 1500s. It is likely that Ethiopian liturgical chants have undergone an evolution similar to that of European liturgical chants. It can be assumed that the notations have become more and more complex as <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed.</b> Regional varieties may have become standardized over time, and more symbols and segments of music have become available for composers.|$|E
25|$|Premature {{ejaculation}} is when ejaculation occurs {{before the}} partner achieves orgasm, or a mutually satisfactory length of <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> during intercourse. There is no correct {{length of time}} for intercourse to last, but generally, premature ejaculation is thought to occur when ejaculation occurs in under 2 minutes {{from the time of}} the insertion of the penis. For a diagnosis, the patient must have a chronic history of premature ejaculation, poor ejaculatory control, and the problem must cause feelings of dissatisfaction as well as distress the patient, the partner or both.|$|E

25|$|The Benton Test {{has been}} criticized by test's {{requirement}} of the examinee's IQ or estimated IQ, which {{can be difficult to}} obtain if the examinee is in a poor condition. In addition, data from studies that look at the viability of retesting a patient have shown conflicting results; some studies show no difference in scores after <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> between two tests, while other studies show a difference. Despite these reports, the Benton Test has several advantages over other tests of visual memory. These include: a more explicit scoring system than other tests, parallel-forms reliability due to the presence of multiple form sets, and short administration time. Because of this, the BVRT is still widely used today for a large number of clinical conditions.|$|E
25|$|While the Pevensies {{are playing}} hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a {{wardrobe}} and enters a wintry fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the faun Mr. Tumnus, who explains the land she has entered and invites {{her to his}} home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving, and he explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia {{and it has been}} winter for 100 years. If a human is encountered they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> in the normal world; her siblings do not believe her story, and when they look in the wardrobe to see only a normal back.|$|E
25|$|The band {{continued}} {{to take a}} more commercial direction. Innocence Is No Excuse released in 1985, created a division amongst fans as the band's once raw, heavy sound had been watered down to gain more attraction to the large US market. The album has, however, gained more appreciation both from fans and critics as <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> since its initial release. A huge sold out world tour in support of the album followed, but tensions began to appear within the band and by early 1986, bassist Steve Dawson was fired from the band, and Saxon was forced to record their eighth studio album Rock the Nations without a replacement bassist. With Elton John making guest appearances as pianist on 2 tracks, and Byford recording the bass parts, the album charted higher than its predecessor and was considered a success. They hired bassist Paul Johnson to play for the band's European arena tour that followed.|$|E
