40|$|The {{mechanics}} of woven carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites {{is influenced by}} the complex architecture of the reinforcement phase. Computational (i. e. finite element based) approaches have been used increasingly to model not only the global laminate stiffness, but also damage evolution and laminate strength. The modeling combines the identification of the architectural unit cell (UC), the selection of suitable constitutive models of the different phases, the creation of a fine discretization of the UC in finite elements, the application of an incremental solution procedure that solves iteratively for the stresses and strains in the UC, [1]. The experimental validation of computational models is carried out mainly at the macroscopical level, i. e. simulation of the macroscopic stress-strain curve. Damage, however, is a localized, straindependent phenomenon and therefore only accurate strain distribution within the UC (at the mesolevel) can identify critical conditions in terms of damage location, extension and evolution. The validation of computational damage procedures is a key task and full-field optical strain analysis methods appear the ideal instrument. However, only limited examples of direct finte element method (FEM) vs experimental strain correlation are found because of the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of some techniques and the complexity and applicative difficulty of others. The aim of the present paper is to present the application of the digital image correlation (DIC) technique, [2], to the full-field strain analysis at the mesoscopic level (i. e. within the UC) of a woven CFRP lamina when the direction of loading forms an angle to the material direction. The material under consideration is a woven carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite. Orthogonal yarns, each made of of several thousand fibers, are woven according the twill-weave architecture is shown in Fig. 1 a. Single-ply laminas were manufactured and tested to eliminate the random 3 D influence of multiple-ply laminates and to favor computational model validation. Specimens with different loading directions with respect to the material principal directions were prepared and tested in a servo-hydraulic testing machine. Specimen surface preparation consisted in a speckle pattern generation to allow the application of the DIC tecnique. During the tensile experiment, the speckle pattern is recorded (frame rate of 0. 1 picture/second) using a CCD camera equipped with a microscopic lens and adjustable light sources. In-house DIC software was used for in-plane displacement and strain determination and mapping. For brevity only the case of loading in the <b>tow</b> <b>yarn</b> direction is considered here. Fig. 1 b shows a tipical strain map obtained with the DIC technique at an applied macroscopic strain of 0. 9 %. The strains are small but the DIC dechnique is sensitive enough and suitable filtering reduce the noise level of the strain maps. Strong local strain gradients are determined and referred to the yarn architecture in Fig. 1 c. The DIC measurements were validated by averaging the strain over the field of view and comparing it with the macroscopic strain given by a high-sensitivity MTS extensometer. The mesoscopic srain data obtained with DIC are used to assess and validate parallel material model development by direct FEM vs experimental strain correlation. Fig. 2 a shows the FEM model of the unit cell for the twill-weave architecture with a detail of the yarn geometry and finite element discretization. Suitable boundary conditions are applied to the UC model contours before the analysis, [1]. Fig. 2 b shows and example of the comparison of the local longitudinal FEM/DIC strain distribution along a transverse line of Fig. 1 c. The comparison shows the excellent correlation achieved both in terms of gradients and absolute strain values, [3]...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fiber {{composites}} utilizing flattened, large <b>tow</b> <b>yarns</b> in woven or braided {{forms are}} being used in many aerospace applications. Their complex fiber architecture and large unit cell size present challenges in both understanding deformation processes and measuring reliable material properties. This report examines composites made using flattened 12 k and 24 k standard modulus carbon fiber yarns in a 0 /+ 60 /- 60 triaxial braid architecture. Standard straight-sided tensile coupons are tested with the 0 axial braid fibers either parallel with or perpendicular to the applied tensile load (axial or transverse tensile test, respectively). Nonuniform surface strain resulting from the triaxial braid architecture is examined using photogrammetry. Local regions of high strain concentration are examined to identify where failure initiates and to determine the local strain {{at the time of}} initiation. Splitting within fiber bundles is the first failure mode observed at low to intermediate strains. For axial tensile tests splitting is primarily in the 60 bias fibers, which were oriented 60 to the applied load. At higher strains, out-of-plane deformation associated with localized delamination between fiber bundles or damage within fiber bundles is observed. For transverse tensile tests, the splitting is primarily in the 0 axial fibers, which were oriented transverse to the applied load. The initiation and accumulation of local damage causes the global transverse stress-strain curves to become nonlinear and causes failure to occur at a reduced ultimate strain. Extensive delamination at the specimen edges is also observed...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} {{polymer matrix}} composites (CF PMCs) are increasingly used in state-of-the-art aerospace applications. Aerospace manufacturers favour components made of CF PMCs over those made of traditional metallic alloys {{because of their}} light weight and corrosion resistance, which lead to significant improvements in fuel consump- tion, increased payload capability, and reduced maintenance and inspection costs. How- ever, manufacturing of CF PMC components is performed differently than traditional material in all stages – design, prototyping and production – and therefore, many com- mercial manufacturers have only recently begun producing components with CF PMCs. The {{first half of this}} thesis was written as a contribution to the CRIAQ COMP- 501 project, which focusses on investigating the cost-effective procurement of airframe com- ponents that are manufactured from final-thickness, net-shaped, and through-thickness reinforced CF preforms. Reinforcement preforms were assembled from commercial 2 D woven fabric using stacks of various configurations of structural through-thickness CF stitch. The contribution herein provides the results obtained from investigations into the mechanical behaviour of the relevant reinforcements, when subjected to pre-infusion op- erations typical to RTM VARTM; mechanical behaviour in compaction, shear (draping) and bending (forming). The second half of this thesis presents the major developments which were made to an alternative process for producing thick 3 D preforms with great versatility, a process originally proposed as a candidate for supplying preforms to the COMP- 501 project.

30|$|Very few {{researchers}} {{have come forward}} and carried out research using woven fabrics {{in the case of}} cut resistant fabrics specifically, {{despite the fact that they}} possess superior mechanical properties in both in-plane and transverse directions compared to knitted fabrics. It has been reported that woven fabrics based on high strength and high modulus fibers with dense structures have the advantage of shear resistance (Tien et al. 2010). Also due to interlacement of <b>tows</b> or <b>yarns,</b> woven fabrics offer high resistance to damage, superior energy absorption (Karahan et al. 2008) and remarkably high values of strain at failure in tension, and loadings (Chou and Ko 1989; Dixit and Mali 2013). With the rapid advancement in the field of textiles, woven fabrics can be fabricated to near knit shape, which could exhibit high degree of flexibility. Therefore, in the present study the comparison of cut resistance behavior of high performance knitted and woven fabrics are analyzed. 100 % Kevlar, 100 % PE and 50 % PE/ 50 % Kevlar composite knitted and woven fabrics were produced on electronic flat knitting machine and shuttle loom, respectively and the cut resistance behavior is clearly highlighted with a comparative analysis between knitted and woven fabrics.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program {{was to develop a}} graphite/aluminum com-posite using epoxy to form an interfacial bond between the fibers and the aluminum. Twenty-two test panels were fabricated and tested for tensile strength and tensile elastic modulus, both in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Although problems were encountered in gripping the longitu-dinal tensile samples, strengths of 1490 MPa (216 ksi) and 89. 6 MPa (13 ksi) were achieved in the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. SCOPE OR A NUMBER of years, investigators have been working on the development F of a graphite/aluminum composite. However, the weak interfacial bond which typically forms between the graphite and the aluminum so weakens the composite material that its mechanical properties are substantially lower than those of graph-ite/epoxy composites. In a recent survey, Nevada Engineering and Technology Corporation (NETCO) found that the most successful graphite/aluminum materials were formed by liquid aluminum infiltration of a graphite <b>tow</b> or <b>yarn</b> to form a precursor wire [1]. These wires were then consolidated into panels by a solid state diffusion press [2]. How-ever, mechanical testing revealed no graphite/aluminum composites that were as strong as graphite/epoxy composites. Typical properties for graphite/aluminum composites are shown in Table 1. To improve the interfacial bond, the approach taken in this program has been to substitute an adhesive bond for the difficult to achieve metallurgical bond.

40|$|In all {{composites}} {{the properties}} {{and structure of}} the reinforcement strongly influence the performance of the material. For some composites, however, the reinforcement also affects the fabrication process itself exerting an additional, second order influence on performance. This is the case for the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process for fabrication of ceramic matrix composites. In this process the matrix forms progressively as a solid deposit, first onto the fiber surfaces, then onto the previous layer of deposit, ultimately growing to fill the inter-fiber porosity. The transport of reactants to the surfaces and the evolved morphology of the matrix depend on the initial reinforcement structure. This structure can vary greatly and is controlled by such factors as fiber size and cross-section, the number of filaments and amount of twist per <b>tow</b> or <b>yarn,</b> and the weave or braid architecture. Often the choice of reinforcement is based on mechanical performance analysis or on the cost and availability of the material or on the temperature stability of the fiber. Given this choice, the composite densification process [...] CVI [...] must be optimized to attain a successful material. Ceramic fiber in the form of cylindrical braided sleeve is an attractive choice for fabrication of tube-form ceramic matrix composites. Multiple, concentric layers of sleeve can be placed over a tubular mandrel, compressed and fixed with a binder to form a freestanding tube preform. This fiber architecture is different than that created by layup of plain weave cloth [...] the material used in most previous CVI development. This report presents the results of the investigation of CVI densification of braided sleeve preforms and the evolution of their structure and transport properties during processing...|$|R

From this comparison, it is apparent why there is an interest in carbon-carbon composites for applications as a strong, light-weight thermal protection system (TPS), or as hot structure, for applications above 2500 F. The lower bound of the carbon-carbon band is representative of the tensile strength of cross-ply Advanced Carbon-Carbon (ACC).

This approach determines fabric geometry based on textile weaving mechanics. A solver with a dynamic explicit algorithm is employed in the DEA. In modeling a uniform fabric, the topology of the fabric unit cell is first established based on the weaving pattern, followed by yarn discretization. An explicit algorithm with a periodic boundary condition is then employed during the simulation. After its detailed geometry is obtained, the unit cell is then assembled to yield a fabric micro-geometry. Fabric micro-geometry can be expressed at both fiber- and yarn-levels. In modeling a near-net shape fabric component, all theories used in simulating the uniform fabric are kept except the periodic boundary condition. Since simulating the entire component at the fiber-level requires a large amount of time and memory, parallel program is used during the simulation. In modeling a net-shape composite, a dynamic molding process is simulated. The near-net shape fabric is modeled using the DEA. Mold surfaces are modeled by standard meshes. Long vertical elements that only take compressive forces are proposed. Finally, micro- and macro-geometry of a fabric reinforced net-shape composite component is obtained...|$|R
