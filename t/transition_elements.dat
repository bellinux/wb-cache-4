Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.|$|E

5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be <b>transition</b> <b>elements.</b> For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the late}} 19th century, chemists {{unanimously}} agreed that thorium and uranium were analogous to hafnium and tungsten; {{the existence of the}} lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one-off fluke. In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements, considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides. In 1922, Danish physicist Niels Bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the <b>transition</b> <b>elements,</b> like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals. The existence of a second inner transition series, {{in the form of the}} actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established; Bohr suggested that the filling of the 5f orbitals may be delayed to after uranium.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> for modelling solid-to-beam and plate-to-beam connections. The approach {{is based upon}} the hybrid stress method and the resulting <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> is hypostatic, i. e. the number of independent stress parameters is less than the number of independent displacements. As a consequence, there are further displacement modes called spurious kinematic modes which are eliminated by means of a suitable “penalty” method. The numerical performance of the proposed element is assessed by a number of relevant tests...|$|R

40|$|A <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> is {{developed}} for the local global analysis of laminated composite beams. It bridges {{one part of the}} domain modelled with a higher order theory and other with a 2 D mixed layerwise theory (LWT) used at critical zone of the domain. The use of developed <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> makes the analysis for interlaminar stresses possible with significant accuracy. The mixed 2 D model incorporates the transverse normal and shear stresses as nodal degrees of freedom (DOF) which inherently ensures continuity of these stresses. Non critical zones are modelled with higher order equivalent single layer (ESL) theory leading to the global mesh with multiple models applied simultaneously. Use of higher order ESL in non critical zones reduces the total number of elements required to map the domain. A substantial reduction in DOF as compared to a complete 2 D mixed model is obvious. This computationally economical multiple modelling scheme using the <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> is applied to static and free vibration analyses of laminated composite beams. Results obtained are in good agreement with benchmarks available in literature...|$|R

25|$|Allred {{used the}} Pauling method to {{calculate}} separate electronegativities for different oxidation {{states of the}} handful of elements (including tin and lead) for which sufficient data was available. However, for most elements, {{there are not enough}} different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known to make this approach feasible. This is particularly true of the <b>transition</b> <b>elements,</b> where quoted electronegativity values are usually, of necessity, averages over several different oxidation states and where trends in electronegativity are harder to see as a result.|$|E
25|$|Which {{elements}} {{start to}} be counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end. In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined <b>transition</b> <b>elements</b> as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum), therefore excluding group 11 (copper, silver and gold), and group 12 (zinc, cadmium and mercury). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed that the transition metals ended at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency. Where the post-transition metals end depends on where the metalloids or nonmetals start. Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium are commonly recognised as metalloids; other authors treat {{some or all of}} these elements as nonmetals.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} more {{convenient}} and conceptually appealing to pass to the barycentric subdivision of Y. The vertices of this subdivision correspond to the simplices of Y, so that each vertex has a group attached to it. The edges of the barycentric subdivision are naturally oriented (corresponding to inclusions of simplices) and each directed edge gives an inclusion of groups. Each triangle has a transition element attached to it belonging {{to the group of}} exactly one vertex; and the tetrahedra, if there are any, give cocycle relations for the <b>transition</b> <b>elements.</b> Thus a complex of groups involves only the 3-skeleton of the barycentric subdivision; and only the 2-skeleton if it is simple.|$|E

In some stones, the inclusion of small, white, radially clustered crystals of cristobalite in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (snowflake obsidian). Obsidian may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (sheen obsidian). An iridescent, rainbow-like sheen (rainbow obsidian) is caused by inclusions of magnetite nanoparticles.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to develop global/local finite element models using partial hybrid stress finite {{elements}} for stress analysis of laminated composite structures. Based on the composite variational principle, the general formulations of partial hybrid single-layer finite element and multilayer finite element are presented. These formulations {{can be used to}} develop a series of partial hybrid finite elements. A 4 -node degenerated plate element, an 8 -node degenerated plate element, a 3 -D, 8 -node solid element, a 3 -D, 20 -node solid element, a 6 -node <b>transition</b> <b>element,</b> a 15 -node <b>transition</b> <b>element,</b> a multilayer solid element, and a multilayer <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> are presented. The elements developed in this thesis are examined by the, eigenvalue test to detect zero-energy deformation modes and the absence of rigid-body motion capability. The results show that the elements do not have any kinematic deformation modes, and they have a desired capability for rigid-body displacement. In addition, the non-zero eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrices are real and positive. In order to determine the optimal partial stress fields for the partial hybrid elements, a classification method of stress modes is presented. The method can be used to classify stress modes, select optimal stress modes, and set up an assumed stress matrix for a hybrid element. Also, the necessary and sufficient condition for avoiding spurious kinematic deformation mode is proposed and the optimal condition of an assumed stress field is presented. A computer program COMSA is developed to implement the partial hybrid finite element method. The Global/Local finite element models are established using plate element, solid <b>element,</b> and <b>transition</b> <b>element.</b> In the thesis, a few numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the finite element models. It has been shown that the global/local models using partial hybrid element are efficient and accurate for stress analysis of laminated composites {{due to the fact that}} they take advantage of the capacity of both 3 -D elements and 2 -D elements...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, four <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> {{families}} that comprise five- to seven-node quadrilateral elements are developed {{based on the}} hybrid-stress and enhanced assumed strain (EAS) formulations for adaptive analyses of axisymmetric elasticity problems. For members in the first hybrid-stress family, a quasi-linear stress field with ten equilibrating stress modes is derived and employed. To study the effect of including more stress modes in the assumed stress field, another family with two additional stress modes is implemented. On the other hand, two EAS element families are constructed {{with respect to the}} incompatible displacement modes of two existing incompatible displacement <b>transition</b> <b>element</b> families. Several numerical examples are exercised. It can be seen that the first hybrid-stress family is the most accurate one among the proposed families. Moreover, the EAS families are close to the respective incompatible families in accuracy yet the former families are not only more efficient in computation but also more concise in formulation. © 2010 Elsevier B.
