5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have their eye and hair color, facial features, and skin tone customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. <b>Their</b> <b>chosen</b> tribe, along with <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E

5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend {{to stay at the}} edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters.|$|E

In 2011, Fordham Military Science began offering a combat nursing program in conjunction with Regis University and the University of Colorado at Denver.|$|E
5|$|The World Before the Flood is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and {{currently in the}} Southampton City Art Gallery. It depicts a scene from John Milton's Paradise Lost in which, among a series of visions of the future shown to Adam, he sees the world immediately before the Great Flood. The painting illustrates the stages of courtship as described by Milton; {{a group of men}} select wives from a group of dancing women, drag <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> woman from the group, and settle down to married life. Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{common toad}} emerges from {{hibernation}} {{in spring and}} there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices {{have been found to be}} able to locate <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E
5|$|Alister Murdoch {{was born}} on 9 December 1912 in Elsternwick, Victoria, the son of {{engineer}} Thomas Murdoch and his wife Kathleen. A lieutenant in the Commonwealth Military Forces {{at the time of}} Alister's birth, Thomas was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in World WarI, and rose to the rank of brigardier as Director General of Engineer Services in World WarII. Educated at Caulfield Grammar School, Alister entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1929, following his elder brother Ian (later a major general). Alister was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which did not at that stage have its own officer training college. Budgetary constraints imposed during the Great Depression necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four-year course. Although offered positions in the Australian Public Service or nominations for short-term commissions with the Royal Air Force, all were determined to serve with the RAAF and were more than pleased with the prospect of entering <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> service early.|$|E
5|$|By 1015, Bulgaria {{had been}} embroiled in {{almost thirty years}} of war with the Byzantine Empire, and Gavril Radomir had succeeded Samuel, who died on 6 October 1014 after the {{disastrous}} Battle of Kleidion. However, from the outset Radomir's position was insecure: Ivan Vladislav, as a son of the elder of the Cometopouli brothers, could lay claim on the throne based on seniority. During that time the Byzantine Emperor Basil II campaigned deep into Bulgarian territory. He retook the previously lost town of Voden (Edessa) and laid siege to the massive fortress of Maglen, situated to the north-west. Gavril Radomir {{did not have enough}} forces and was unable to interfere and could only watch the course of the events from the nearby Lake Ostrovo. His inability to cope with the Byzantine threat aroused discontent among the nobility and Ivan Vladislav became <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> leader. The fall of Maglen sealed Gavril Radomir's fate—in the late summer of 1015, while hunting near Ostrovo (Arnissa), he was murdered by his cousin, perhaps at the behest of Byzantine agents. Ivan Vladislav then seized the Bulgarian throne and took steps to ensure his position against potential rivals.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> username.|$|E
5|$|The School of Music {{presents}} an annual series of concerts that showcase talent {{in a variety}} of genres. School of Music at FIU offers a dynamic learning environment for informed, creative musicians. Students are fully involved in <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> fields, where they can recognize clearly what they need to learn in order to become contributors to those fields. FIU's School of Music embraces an evolving world for its possibilities and the new opportunities and challenges that it affords, while providing the tools necessary to empower young musicians in their quest to carve out careers. FIU School of Music's concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, early music, chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} black vultures' {{breeding}} season {{varies with the}} latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in Ohio generally do not start before March. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. Some in South America breed even later than that—black vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February. Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> nest site.|$|E
5|$|The Reich Film Chamber, {{which all}} members of the film {{industry}} were required to join, was created in June 1933. Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages. Under the auspices of the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre. As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had {{to be a member of}} the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> field and thus silenced. In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored. Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The characters' {{body and}} facial {{movements}} were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided {{the basis for}} their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that <b>their</b> <b>chosen</b> hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features {{as close as possible to}} their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts. Something that both in-house and external staff contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.|$|E
