However, the game surpassed many expectations; in his review, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani asked readers the rhetorical question; [...] "Notice that I didn't mention the Halo3 beta offer during this whole article? That's because it's completely irrelevant when looking at Crackdown, it's a solid game that delivers exactly what it promises: a giant sandbox to blow <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of".|$|E

In a 1979 game against the Houston Oilers, with only seconds remaining and Houston leading 20â€“17, the Oilers lined up near the Pittsburgh goal line to run their final play. With victory already assured for the Oilers, Greene pointed angrily across {{the line of scrimmage}} at Houston quarterback Dan Pastorini, warning, [...] "If you come into the end zone, I'll beat <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of you!

Also at Tor.com, in Ryan Britt and Emily Asher-Perrin's list of the ten most under-appreciated elements of Star Trek, they placed [...] "Space Seed" [...] at number three saying that [...] "As an introductory story to what old school Star Trek was all about, 'Space Seed' is perfect.

50|$|In 1975 Scoblete {{experimented with}} acting, and in 1979 co-founded The Other Vic Theatre Company, a {{professional}} touring troupe that played dinner theatres, resorts, and charities. During {{his time with}} the Company, Scoblete produced, directed, and acted in approximately 50 plays. In 1985, while researching {{the role of a}} gambler for the play The Only Game in Town, Scoblete and his co-star Alene Paone went to Atlantic City to do some research, which made them realize that they liked gambling more than acting. The play toured for four months. Scoblete sold his share of the theatre company in 1989, and starting writing columns for gaming magazines such as WIN Magazine. He spent the majority of his time from 1986 to 1992 in the casinos. His first book on the subject was Beat <b>the</b> <b>Craps</b> <b>Out</b> of <b>the</b> Casinos, published in 1991 by Paone Press, a mail-order publishing house founded by his future wife Paone, who has also taught at Lawrence Middle School.

500|$|In contrast, Amy Kaufman from Los Angeles Times {{opined that}} Cavallari was more {{intriguing}} than Conrad, whose storylines she felt had been overshadowed as the series progressed. Tracie Egan Morrissey of Jezebel commented that she [...] "kind of [...] Kristin", {{and was glad}} to see her replacing Conrad. Julie Miller from Movieline was critical of the episode's [...] "staged showdowns", but nonetheless noted that the series [...] "continues to compel" [...] like professional wrestling and enjoyed a scene in which Jenner became irritated with Nicole, labeling it the sole genuine reaction of the episode. Writing for Homorazzi, Patrick [...] "loved this episode", and expressed an interest in the love triangle that seemingly develops between Cavallari, Jenner, and Nicole.

500|$|Tritter first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Fools for Love". His {{character}} is a police detective who suffers from a severe irritation {{in the area of}} his groin, which he believes to be caused by a sexually transmitted disease, and who becomes a patient of the walk-in clinic. Although House diagnoses Tritter with dry skin, a common side effect of the nicotine gum that Tritter is chewing, Tritter requests that a sample be tested. House declines on the grounds that he has already met this month's quota for indulging [...] "stubborn idiots". After Tritter causes House to trip, the doctor feigns acquiescence, but insists he has to take Tritter's temperature rectally. After inserting the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no intention of returning. Tritter later complains about his treatment to House's boss, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), saying that he would rather [...] "beat <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of" [...] House than sue him; however, House refuses to apologize. Later that night, Tritter pulls House over for a traffic violation and arrests him after finding Vicodin pills in his pocket.|$|E
500|$|Liu Kang's Fatality {{from the}} {{original}} game is the [...] "Shaolin Uppercut", in which he performs a butterfly kick (often mistaken for a cartwheel) on his opponent before hitting an uppercut that knocks them offscreen before landing. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, there were two versions; one where the victim explodes to pieces upon impact and the original, in which the opponent is torn to pieces upon falling to the ground. In another signature Fatality, he morphs into a large dragon, chomping the upper body of his opponent. This Fatality was turned into an Animality in Mortal Kombat 3 and back into a normal Fatality in Mortal Kombat 4. In the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of Mortal Kombat II, the dragon torches the opponent with fire instead. The series' composer and co-designer John Vogel noted it to be his favorite Fatality due to how much Liu Kang's appearance changes. Another famous Fatality of Liu Kang has him vanish and a Mortal Kombat arcade game machine drop down and crush his opponent. According to GameSpy's MK2011 walkthrough, Liu Kang [...] "inflicts better damage" [...] than Kung Lao [...] "by jumping around like a lunatic and kicking <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of everything he sees." ...|$|E

In 2011, the museum {{was featured}} in <b>the</b> book <b>Crap</b> Days <b>Out,</b> in which the authors stated: [...] "It's awful if you don't like teapots.

5000|$|The {{film has}} been noted for its {{implementation}} of a secret society subplot driving Leatherface's family to terrorize civilians in order to provoke them {{to a level of}} transcendence; in a retrospective interview, Kim Henkel confirmed that the basis of the subplot was influenced by theories surrounding the Illuminati. Commenting on the film's ominous Rothman character, Henkel stated: [...] "He comes off more like the leader of some harum-scarum cult that makes a practice of bringing victims to experience horror on the pretext that it produces some sort of transcendent experience. Of course, it does produce a transcendent experience. Death is like that. But no good comes of it. Youâ€™re tortured and tormented, and get <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> scared <b>out</b> of you, and then you die." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{the final}} version of [...] "Part Two" [...] is quite enclosed, the initial script was {{considered}} epic, with production designer Jerry Wanek jokingly referring to it as a [...] "six-hour mini-series". In the original version, the giant devil's trap keeping demons away from the gateway to Hell was much more complex, with each point in the pentagram being a church housing a holy relicâ€”such as a sliver from the True Cross. With the artifacts powering the devil's trap, Jake's role would have been to go to each church and destroy them, the hunters following after him to try to stop him. Jake would then eventually destroy the final relic during a fight with Sam, and Dean would race to the gateway to prevent Azazel from opening it while Jake and Sam are [...] "beating <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of each other". However, when director and executive producer Kim Manners received the script, he realized it was huge, and had the storyboard artist make five-and-a-half hours of storyboards for the episode to prove that it could not be filmed without going {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} over-budget. Production suggested that a large amount of money could be saved by not depicting the churches, which were major set pieces for the intended story. Kripke realized that instead of using churches, he could have the points of the pentagram be connected by railroad tracks. With tracks being made of iron, it fit perfectly with the series mythology because iron is a demon deterrent. Kripke found this aspect to be more Western, matching the tone of show. Rather than destroying the devil's trap as in the original script, Jake is instead sent by Azazel to open the gateway himself, and the major fight scene between Jake and Sam was then changed into a standoff between Jake and the hunters. Though the storyline had to be toned down, Kripke felt that this improved the overall episode by making it simpler.|$|E
2500|$|According to creator Eric Kripke, {{the show}} {{originally}} {{was intended to}} focus on the weekly monsters, with Sam and Dean Winchester merely being [...] "an engine to get us in and out of different horror movies every week". His sole desire was to merely [...] "scare <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of people". However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. This revelation caused them to change the series to focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters. According to Kripke, [...] "...sometimes we don't even have the monster until way late in the break, once we get all the angst and the drama done first." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'Iâ€™m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and thatâ€™s what hooked you in â€“ when characters got into trouble, you didnâ€™t know if theyâ€™d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid. He said it, [...] "Scared <b>the</b> <b>crap</b> <b>out</b> of me. I hid behind my dadâ€™s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked when we could see it again â€“ that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E
