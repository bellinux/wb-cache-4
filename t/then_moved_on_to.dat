5|$|After the 1932 season, University of Chicago {{president}} Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins {{forced out}} 70-year-old head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom he considered {{too old for}} the position. Stagg <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> coach at the College of the Pacific. Athletic director T. Nelson Metcalf hired Shaughnessy to replace Stagg as head coach in 1933. Shaughnessy inherited a difficult situation at Chicago, {{and for the most}} part, lacked good material. He did, however, inherit from Stagg at least one important recruit: inaugural Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom many Midwest pundits considered the best back of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her {{with a sense of}} belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E

Federer won the title for a record fourth time, and, in doing so, equalled Rafael Nadal's record of 19 ATP Masters 1000 titles.|$|E
5|$|John Charles Clegg (better {{known as}} just Charles) became a massive {{influence}} on the national {{as well as the}} local game. As a player, he was involved in the first inter-association match and became the first Sheffield-based player to be capped (gaining his only cap in the first international). He went on to become president of both the city's professional sides (playing a large part in the creation of Sheffield United) and held the same position at Sheffield and Hallamshire FA having overseen the merger of the two rival local FAs. He <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> national prominence when he became chairman of the FA in 1890 and president in 1923. He held both positions until his death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member ran the first obstacle, then passed its flag to a partner, who <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the next obstacle. The team continued to alternate in this manner until they had completed the course or until time ran out. For safety reasons, team members were given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.|$|E

(Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The Steiners and The Headshrinkers had {{faced each other}} at WrestleMania in a match won by the Steiners. The Steiners <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> feud with Money Inc., the WWF Tag Team Champions. The Gunns made their WWF debut {{in the spring of}} 1993 and faced The Headshrinkers in a series of matches. The match was not a standard tag team match so the championship was not on the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{headed by}} Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, though {{probably not the}} first Europeans to visit the area, are the first recorded to have crossed the Chicago Portage and travelled along the Chicago River. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days {{near the mouth of}} the river, <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674–75. Joliet and Marquette did not report any Indians living near the Chicago River area at this time, though archaeologists have since discovered numerous Indian village sites elsewhere in the Chicago area. Two of La Salle's men built a stockade at the portage in the winter of 1682/1683.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the tour's {{itinerary}} took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels {{and then on to}} Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Blücher and {{the damage}} done to Lützow caused the German force to withdraw. The ground troops were landed on {{the eastern side of the}} fjord; they {{proceeded}} inland and captured the Oscarborg Fortress by 09:00 on 10 April. They <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> attack the capital. Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Blüchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city.|$|E
5|$|Upon retirement, Smith {{took over}} for Mel Allen {{as the host}} of the {{television}} series This Week in Baseball (TWIB) in 1997. Smith also became color commentator for the local broadcast of Cardinals games on KPLR-TV from 1997 to 1999. When his stint on This Week in Baseball concluded, Smith <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> do work for CNN-SI beginning in 1999. After La Russa retired as manager of the Cardinals in 2011, Smith became active in the organization again, starting with his stint as a special instructor for the team's 2012 spring training camp.|$|E
5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the Hanford site. It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it {{was turned over to}} research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.|$|E

5|$|In December 1943, the Alsos Mission reached Algiers, where Pash {{reported}} to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ), Major General Walter B. Smith, and his British Chief of Intelligence, Brigadier Kenneth Strong. This was awkward as Pash's instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission, {{but it turned out}} that Strong was already fully aware of it. It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong's American deputy, Colonel Thomas E. Roderick. The Alsos Mission <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Italy, where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce's Allied Control Commission. Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio, the man who had negotiated Italy's surrender to the Allies, and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government, who gave him a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities.|$|E
5|$|In May 1912, the Training Division {{patrolled the}} coast, but saw no action. The {{following}} month, Sardegna and her sisters, along with six torpedo boats, escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa, {{one of the}} last ports in Libya still under Ottoman control. The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing; after taking the city, the Italian forces <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Misrata. Sardegna {{and the rest of the}} ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July. The Training Division then returned to Italy, where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August, this time to Zuara, the last port in Ottoman hands. The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later, which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south. With the capture of the city, Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast. On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party <b>then</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E
