However, the spherical shape and fixed position of the selected volume posed serious limitations to the study of heart and transplanted kidney by topical MRS. Phosphorus- 31 spectra of approximately 30 cm- 3 of brain or liver could be obtained in 8 min. Ratios of metabolite concentrations could be determined with a coefficient of variation ranging from 10 % to 30 %. The ratios of phosphocreatine/ATP and inorganic phosphate/ATP in brain were 1. 8 and 0. 3, respectively. The ratio of inorganic phosphate/ATP in liver was 0. 9. Intracellular pH was 7. 03 in brain and 7. 24 in liver. The T 1 relaxation times of phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate and gamma-ATP in brain were 4. 8 s, 2. 5 s and 1. 0 s, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a new instrument measuring patient anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging examinations, <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire. Background: Questionnaires measuring patients’ anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging examinations {{have been the}} same as used {{in a wide range of}} conditions. To learn about patients’ experience during examination and to evaluate interventions, a specific questionnaire measuring patient anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging is needed. Design: Psychometric cross-sectional study with test-retest design. Methods: A new questionnaire, <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire, was designed from patient expressions of anxiety in <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imagingscanners. The sample was recruited between October 2012 –October 2014. Factor structure was evaluated with exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha. Criterion-related validity, known-group validity and test-retest was calculated. Results: Patients referred for <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging of either the spine or the heart, were invited to participate. The development and validation of <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire resulted in 15 items consisting of two factors.

40|$|AIMS: To assess fistula track healing after {{infliximab}} treatment using <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging. METHODS: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> {{imaging and}} clinical evaluation were performed {{before and after}} three infliximab infusions given over a 6 -week period. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> images were evaluated for abscesses and fistula tracks. Paired <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> image examinations were rated 'better', 'unchanged' or 'worse'. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging and clinical outcomes were then compared. RESULTS: Of the 12 referred patients, pre-treatment <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging detected abscesses in three (two not treated). Of the 10 treated patients, seven had peri-anal fistulas, two of whom also had recto-vaginal fistulas, and three had abdominal wall entero-cutaneous fistulas. After infliximab, four were in remission, one had a response and five were non-responders. One developed a peri-anal abscess. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging improved in six, was unchanged in two and was worse in two. In {{four of the six}} with improvement in <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging, the fistula track resolved, but two of these had clinically persistent entero-cutaneous fistulas. The clinical outcome and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging correlated in seven of the 10 patients; in three (two entero-cutaneous and one peri-anal), there was discordance. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging identifies clinically silent sepsis. Fistulas may persist despite clinical remission.

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> {{angiography}} is a new, noninvasive technique whose diagnostic {{value in}} vertebrobasilar artery disease {{has not yet}} been determined. Methods: Forty-one patients with acute cerebellar and/or brain-stem ischemia were examined by routine <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging, extracranial and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and selective intra-arterial arteriography. Results were correlated with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> angiography. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> angiography was accomplished using a three-dimensional time-of-flight gradient-echo technique. Results: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> angiography correctly identified all occlusions, stenoses, and an aneurysm within the distal vertebrobasilar system as revealed by conventional intra-arterial arteriography but missed the diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection in one case. This results in a sensitivity of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> angiography of 97 % and a specificity of 98. 9 %o. However, the degree of stenoses was difficult to evaluate by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> angiography.
