Costumed in a long burgundy gown made of satin, Gothel wears her <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> in [...] "a theatrical up-do." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his flying service Ball was {{primarily}} a [...] "lone-wolf" [...] pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its Foster mounting, angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage. [...] According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, [...] "it was quite {{a work of art}} to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, {{and at the same time}} manage one's machine accurately". [...] Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. [...] Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> longer than regulations generally permitted.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Certainly. He was dark, of swarthy complexion, tall, thin, with bushy {{eyebrows and}} <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and short beard. He spoke English {{with just the}} faintest {{suspicion}} of a foreign accent.' ...|$|E

50|$|Alcide Herveaux is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Southern Vampire Mysteries/Sookie Stackhouse novels by author Charlaine Harris. He is a Were (a full blooded werewolf) {{who owns a}} construction company in Jackson, Mississippi with his father. He is depicted as {{a tall man with}} green eyes, and <b>thick,</b> tousled <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Blue monkey beetles are small, usually [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. Males and females exhibit little sexual {{dimorphism}} in overall body size. Very small scales cover {{most of the}} body, including the middle and hind pairs of legs, and excepting the head and anterior legs. The scales in males are bright ultramarine to sky blue dorsally, and the underside scales are more silvery. Female colouring is an overall sienna brown, {{with a mix of}} brown and yellow-orange scales, and with darker bands of scales found near the pygidium and propygidium. The black legs bear a few <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs.</b> Dense short greyish to silvery white fine hairs cover the margins of the thorax and abdomen.|$|R
60|$|At last his servant entered. He {{watched the}} strong, easy young figure, the fine eyebrows, the <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> In a week's time the youth had got back his old well-being. The {{hands of the}} officer twitched {{and seemed to be}} full of mad flame.|$|E
6000|$|Robins had in {{some measure}} {{recovered}} himself. He was a quiet, hollow-eyed young person, with <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and a thin frame, about which the uniform of the ship hung loosely. [...] "You are the man who boarded the steamer from a seaplane, aren't you, and pretended afterwards {{to be such a}} ninny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She paused, {{and pushed}} her <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> (already {{streaked}} with gray) back from her temples. Her eyes, large and dark and dim, rested on Emily with a sorrowful interest. [...] "When your young friends wake to-morrow morning," [...] she went on, [...] "you can tell them that the new teacher, whom nobody likes, has left the school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{come and}} stay with her," [...] said Rosamond, a {{striking}} figure, in a scarlet dressing-gown, with a <b>thick</b> plait of <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> hanging down to her waist on either side.|$|R
50|$|Coe's {{biography}} of Windradyne from 1989 {{states that he}} was handsome and well built, with broad shoulders and muscular limbs. He had dark brown skin, <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> curly <b>hair,</b> and a long beard. He typically wore a headband, and had his beard plaited into three sections. However, Coe's description does not fully correlate with a drawing of a Wiradjuri warrior that is thought to depict Windradyne.|$|R
50|$|Hijiki {{has been}} a part of the Japanese diet for centuries. Hijiki is rich in dietary fibre and {{essential}} minerals such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. According to Japanese folklore, hijiki aids health and beauty, and <b>thick,</b> <b>black,</b> lustrous <b>hair</b> is connected to regular consumption of small amounts of hijiki. Hijiki has been sold in United Kingdom natural products stores for 30 years and hijiki's culinary uses have been adopted in North America.|$|R
60|$|The Kid seldom smiled; but {{he smiled}} and waved his hat when he saw her. He dismounted, and his girl sprang into his arms. The Kid looked at her fondly. His <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> clung to {{his head like a}} {{wrinkled}} mat. The meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth, dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask.|$|E
60|$|Captain Griffiths {{shook his}} head. He {{was a man}} {{considerably}} older than his questioner, with long, nervous face, and <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> streaked with grey. His fingers were bony, his complexion, for a soldier, curiously sallow, and notwithstanding his height, which was considerable, he was awkward, at times almost uncouth. His voice was hard and unsympathetic, and his contributions to the tea-table talk had been almost negligible.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know just}} when I {{began to notice}} a change in Jack, but {{when he came home}} two years ago, a {{full-fledged}} M.D.--a great, tall, broad-shouldered fellow, with the sweetest moustache, and lovely <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> just made for poking one's fingers through--I realized it to the full. Jack was grown up. The dear old days of bird-nesting and nutting and coasting and fishing and general delightful goings-on were over forever.|$|E
5000|$|Panurgus {{species are}} small to medium in size, {{reaching}} 5 - 14 mm. Most species (subgenus Panurgus s.str.) are almost entirely <b>black.</b> The <b>hair</b> is relatively sparse, but the male has a <b>thick,</b> long, <b>black</b> facial <b>hair.</b> The {{body surface area}} largely bald and shiny. The abdomen has a typical, slightly diamond-shaped outline.|$|R
5000|$|Frank [...] "Pony" [...] Baker: {{the main}} {{character}} of the story. He is a young boy who is little, dark, and round, with a <b>thick</b> crop of <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> Nicknamed [...] "Pony," [...] so {{he would not be}} confused with his cousin of the same name.|$|R
60|$|WE {{left the}} cabin and found {{a man at the}} {{companion}} obstructing our way. He was standing on the ladder with his back to us, peering over the combing of the hatchway. He was, I could see, a misshapen man, short, broad, and clumsy, with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk between his shoulders. He was dressed in dark-blue serge, and had peculiarly <b>thick,</b> coarse, <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> I heard the unseen dogs growl furiously, and forthwith he ducked back,--coming into contact with the hand I put out to fend him off from myself. He turned with animal swiftness.|$|R
60|$|Sir John's long sallow {{face was}} preternaturally grave {{when he entered}} the cabin, where Rosamund awaited him. He bowed to her with a grave courtesy, doffing his hat and casting it upon a chair. The last five years had brought some strands of white into his <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> and at the temples in {{particular}} it showed very grey, giving him an appearance of age to which the deep lines in his brow contributed.|$|E
6000|$|... (Catherine who has at {{this early}} hour made only a [...] very {{perfunctory}} toilet, and wears a Bulgarian [...] apron over a once brilliant, but now half worn out [...] red dressing gown, and a colored handkerchief tied [...] over her <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> with Turkish slippers [...] on her bare feet, comes from the house, looking [...] astonishingly handsome and stately under all the [...] circumstances. Louka goes into the house.) ...|$|E
60|$|Sophia, who was eleven, had not stirred to meet her. She alone {{inherited}} her father's fine straight profile, {{and large}} black eyes, {{but she had}} the heaviness of feature that sometimes goes with very dark complexions. The white frock did not become her brown neck and arms, her <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> was arranged in too womanly a manner, and her head and face looked too large; moreover, there was no lighting-up to answer the greeting, and Albinia was disappointed.|$|E
40|$|Barron St. John {{must have}} been nearing his seventies by that point. The {{pictures}} Iâ€™d copied from magazine covers and newspapers charted his rise from a rake-thin tower of a man, nearly six-three, clad in a badly fitting white wool jacket with a <b>thick</b> crop of <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> cut like a bowl around his ears to his older self: hair grey but still as thick as it had ever been, fine laugh lines etching the curve of that grinning, maniac mouth...|$|R
6000|$|On {{her first}} day in the office she had been startled by an astounding {{young man who had}} come flying past her desk, with his coat off, his figured {{waistcoat}} half open, his red four-in-hand tie askew under a rolling soft collar. He had dashed up to the office-manager and demanded, [...] "Say! Say! Nat! Got that Kokomobile description copied for me yet? Heh? Gawd! you're slow. Got a cigarette?" [...] He went off, puffing out cigarette smoke, shaking his head and audibly muttering, [...] "Slow bunch, werry." [...] He seemed to be of Una's own age, or perhaps a year older--a slender young man with horn-rimmed eye-glasses, curly <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> and a trickle of black mustache. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbow, and Una had a secret, shamed, shivering thrill in the contrast of the dead-white skin of his thin forearms with the long, <b>thick,</b> soft, <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> matted over them. They seemed at once feminine and acidly male.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan of the Apes {{stood looking}} down upon his kill, {{and as he}} stood there he ran {{his fingers through his}} <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> shock of <b>hair.</b> Presently he stooped and touched the dead body. Some of the red life-blood of the gorilla crimsoned his fingers. He raised them to his nose and sniffed. Then {{he shook his head and}} turned toward the cabin. The door was still open. He closed it and {{fastened}} the latch. Returning toward the body of his kill he again paused and scratched his head.|$|R
60|$|It {{was the old}} Tarzan {{who turned}} {{questioning}} eyes upon the little knot of apes before him. It was the old Tarzan who {{shook his head as}} though to toss back a heavy mane that had fallen before his face--an old habit dating from the days that his great shock of <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> had fallen about his shoulders, and often tumbled before his eyes when it had meant life or death to him to have his vision unobstructed.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} {{grinding}} of wheels upon gravel. The old cab had actually pulled up at Challenger's door. I saw the young occupant step out from it. An instant later the maid, who looked as tousled and bewildered {{as if she had}} that instant been aroused from the deepest sleep, appeared with a card upon a tray. Challenger snorted ferociously as he looked at it, and his <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> seemed to bristle up in his wrath.|$|E
60|$|As I {{sit here}} writing to you, M., I {{wish you could}} see the whole scene. This young man lies within reach of me, flat on his back, his hands clasp'd across his breast, his <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> cut close; he is dozing, {{breathing}} hard, every breath a spasm--it looks so cruel. He is a noble youngster,--I consider him past all hope. Often there is no one with him for a long while. I am here as much as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The hrossa (singular hross) {{resemble}} bipedal otters or seals, and {{are somewhat}} taller and thinner than humans. Ransom finds them beautiful: [...] "covered, face and all, with <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> animal <b>hair,</b> and whiskered {{like a cat}} ... glossy coat, liquid eye, sweet breath and whitest teeth" [...] (p.59, Chap. 9). They live in the low river valleys (handramit in the speech of the eldila) and specialize in farming, fishing, and performing arts such as dancing and poetry. They are especially gifted in making poetry; yet they refuse {{to write it down}} as they believe that books ruin words and poems. Their technical level is low, and they wear only pocketed loincloths. The boats that they build are similar to our canoes. They add an initial /h/ sound to their words. Their sense of humor is [...] "extravagant and fantastic" [...] (Chap. 18).|$|R
50|$|Phineas Phreak is the {{intellectual}} and idealist of the group. He has enough mastery of chemistry to create new drugs and takes an avid interest in politics. Of the three, {{he is the most}} committed to social change and environmental issues. He is from Texas and while his mother is relaxed and open-minded, his father is a card-carrying member of the John Birch Society. He is the hairiest of the brothers - tall and skinny with a <b>thick</b> bush of <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> a beard, and glasses. He is the stereotypical left-wing radical, bearing a superficial resemblance to Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't know," [...] said Miss Vane, rising. [...] "I'm almost {{afraid to}} stir, {{in view of}} the {{possible}} consequences. But I can't sit here all day, and if Mrs. Sewell will excuse me, I'll go at once. Yes, 'I guess I better be going,' as your particle Barker says. Let us hope he'll get safely back to his infinitesimal little crevice in the cosmos. He's a very pretty particle, don't you think? That <b>thick,</b> coarse, wavy <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> growing in a natural bang over his forehead would make his fortune if he were a certain kind of young lady." ...|$|R
60|$|He was degenerating visibly, {{under the}} eyes of all. He had entirely lost the almost foppish concern for his appearance, and was grown {{careless}} and slovenly in his dress. He allowed a black beard to grow on cheeks that had ever been so carefully shaven; and the long, <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> once so sedulously curled, hung now in a lank, untidy mane about a face that was changing from its vigorous swarthiness to an unhealthy sallow, whilst the blue eyes, that had been so vivid and compelling, were now dull and lacklustre.|$|E
60|$|Teeka {{rolled her}} eyes in his {{direction}} and strained the squirming mite still closer to her. Tarzan came nearer. Teeka drew away and bared her fangs. Tarzan was nonplussed. In all his experiences with Teeka, never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today {{she did not look}} playful. Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his <b>thick,</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> cocked his head upon one side, and stared. Then he edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing which Teeka cuddled.|$|E
60|$|As he dashed {{the cold}} water {{over his head and}} face, he felt {{completely}} himself again, and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> all glistening with the fresh moisture, he went into the workshop to look out the wood for his father's coffin, intending that he and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan Burge's and have the coffin made by one of the workmen there, so that his mother might not see and hear the sad task going forward at home.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of George L. Mesnager, an early French citizen, [s. d. ]. A {{young man with}} <b>thick</b> short <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and a dark beard stares toward the left. He has a subdued widow's peak, long pointed nose, thin lips and clear complexion. He wears a dark suit, with a white undershirt beneath it.; In 1914 George Mesnager, French-American of Los Angeles, left to fight for France. He was 64 years old. Fought all through the war and was wounded in action five times. Awarded the distinguished Service Cross. (In 1870 this same George Mesnager had left Los Angeles to fight for France in the Franco-Prussian War). In 1922, Mesnager, then living in Verdugo Hills, felt {{he was going to}} die and went to France once more. Shortly after his arrival he died and was buried with military honors in the town of his birth...|$|R
60|$|He {{was quite}} a contrast, in all respects, to his Indian companion, Hawkswing, who, {{although}} about as tall, was not nearly so massive or powerful. Like most North American Indians, he was grave and taciturn in disposition; in other respects there was nothing striking about him. He was clad, like his comrades, in a trapper's hunting-shirt and leggings; but he scorned to use a cap of any kind, conceiving that his <b>thick,</b> straight, <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> was a sufficient covering, as undoubtedly it was. He was as courageous as most men; a fair average shot, and, when occasion required, as lithe and agile as a panther; {{but he was not}} a hero--few savages are. He possessed one good quality, however, beyond his kinsmen--he preferred mercy to revenge, and did not gloat over the idea of tearing the scalps off his enemies, and fringing his coat and leggings therewith.|$|R
60|$|Filled {{with the}} sense of horror still to come, {{somebody}} pulled aside the little screen. They fully expected to find the lifeless bodies of Mr. Yahi-Bahi and the faithful Ram Spudd. What they saw before them was more dreadful still. The outer Oriental garments of the two devotees lay strewn upon the floor. The long sash of Yahi-Bahi and the thick turban of Ram Spudd were side by side near them; almost sickening in its repulsive realism was the <b>thick</b> <b>black</b> head of <b>hair</b> of the junior devotee, apparently torn from his scalp as if by lightning and bearing a horrible resemblance to the cast-off wig of an actor.|$|R
