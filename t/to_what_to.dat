5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep {{a small part of}} Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The Remembrancer was {{appointed}} for life, and qualified {{to appoint a}} deputy, the first of whom, John West, {{was appointed}} by Sir Christopher Hatton in 1616. From 1565 until 1716, the office was kept in the Fanshawe family, starting with Henry Fanshawe and ending with Simon Fanshawe. After 1820, the Remembrancer's broad duties were split up by the Court of Exchequer (England) etc. Act 1820. To replace him, two masters were appointed, {{one of whom was}} to be the accountant general. These officials were to be appointed by the Chief Baron of the Exchequer from barristers of five years standing, holding offices during good behaviour and unable to appoint a deputy. The masters handled the taking of minutes previously undertaken by the Remembrancer, with the accountant general overseeing all money paid into the court, which was deposited in the Bank of England; previously the Remembrancer had held complete discretion as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the money.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> commemorate and how. Those memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Iraq War and the {{drawdown}} of the War in Afghanistan, {{there was}} some question as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with MRAPs, as they were designed specifically for asymmetric warfare. The Army decided they would keep them in some sort of service post-war. Of the approximately 20,000 MRAPs in service, 30 percent (6,000) will stay in brigade combat teams as troop transports and route clearance vehicles, 10 percent (2,000) will be used for training, and 60 percent (12,000) will go into storage. MRAPs are to be superseded by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle when it enters service in 2016. It still may be used until 2022, when the JLTV is in use in sufficient numbers.|$|E

The Toungoo command was split as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next. One faction led by Gen. Nanda Thingyan recommended lifting the siege, reasoning that it was more important to defend the delta. But others including Bayinnaung disliked an outright lifting of the siege because Prome's forces, they feared, could join in on an attack from the north. In the end, they settled on the proposal by Thiri Zeya Kyawhtin: (1) continue the appearance of a siege with a minimal force, (2) meet the enemy on both fronts, (3) if either front fails, lift the siege and defend the homeland, and (4) resume the siege if the Arakanese were defeated.|$|E

25|$|While {{long after}} {{designing}} the Long Island parkway system, Robert Moses constructed three stations along the Northern State Parkway. One was located {{east of the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway interchange (exit31A) in Carle Place, which was closed in 1986. The second was located in Commack, located west of CR4, opened in the early 1950s and abandoned in 1985. The Commack station, which still stands, was proposed in 1989 by the Huntington town historian Rufus Langhans the save the station, which {{was in danger of}} being demolished, suggesting the station be declared a town landmark and possibly be a welcome center for the Northern State.

However, her on/off flirtation with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) is the only {{relationship}} that lasts and they marry in March 2001, despite Steve finding out that she had slept with Phil on Christmas Day 2000 in a drunken one-night stand. On their wedding day, Phil is shot by a mystery assailant and Steve is the prime suspect. Mel suspects it is him but he protests his innocence. Phil recovers from the shooting and confronts the culprit who {{turns out to be}} Lisa. Steve forgives Mel and on Phil's instruction, he decides to frame his enemy Dan. Dan is wrongly imprisoned for Phil's attempted murder, and after his release, believing that it was Steve who actually shot him, kidnaps Mel in revenge. Dan demands a large sum of money and Steve grows desperate. During her few days of captivity, Dan tells Mel about Steve's dodgy dealings and criminal activities. Phil comes to her rescue and Dan flees. Mel takes time out after burning down her and Steve's club, E20, as revenge for Steve's lies. He woos her round, however, and they plan to emigrate to America with Lisa, her boyfriend Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and Lisa's daughter, Louise (Rachel Cox).

40|$|ABSTRACT Globalization, {{contrary}} to the opinion of many HRD professionals, {{has led to a}} better world, one in which greater numbers of people have the opportunity for peace, prosperity and freedom. Anti-global critics are tragically wrong for they condemn millions of people to poverty, disease, force migrations, ethical strife, and terrorism. HRD professionals shold not be persuaded by anecdotal, selective and sentimental stories, but act with real facts and offer real, long-term solutions. KEY WORDS: Globalization, peace, freedom, prosperity Globalization has made the world a better place, a world that will eventually lead to economic prosperity, political freedom, and world peace (Bhagwati, 2004; Moore, 2000). Friedman (2000) notes that globalization, which {{is the result of the}} democratization of finance, technology, and information, is driven by our basic human desire for a better life – a life with more freedom to choose how <b>to</b> prosper, <b>what</b> <b>to</b> eat, <b>what</b> <b>to</b> wear, where to live, where to travel, how <b>to</b> work, <b>what</b> <b>to</b> read, <b>what</b> <b>to</b> write, and <b>what</b> <b>to</b> learn. A valuable benefit of a globalized world is the uninhibited movement of ideas, people, values, and systems across the globe...|$|R
