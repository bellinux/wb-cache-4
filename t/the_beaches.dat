5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{advance of}} the 18th RCT cleared away the last {{remnants}} of the force defending the E-1 draw.

Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.|$|E
5|$|When local {{fishermen}} catch a large tiger shark, {{the mayor}} proclaims <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth {{embedded in the}} submerged hull. He drops it after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b> Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire Quint.|$|E

5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Australian <b>beach</b> is now {{accepted}} as {{a significant part of}} Australian national culture and identity. However, Huntsman (2001) and Booth (2001) both believe that <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> is dying: “intellectuals have failed to apply to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>the</b> attention they have lavished on the bush…” (Huntsman 2001, 218). Yet <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> remains a prominent image in contemporary literature and film; authors such as Tim Winton and Robert Drewe frequently set their stories in and around the coast. Although initially considered a space of myth (Fiske, Hodge, and Turner 1987), Meaghan Morris labelled <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> as ‘ordinary’ (1998), and as recently as 2001 {{in the wake of the}} Sydney Olympic Games, Bonner, McKee, and Mackay termed <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> ‘tacky’ and ‘familiar’. <b>The</b> <b>beach,</b> it appears, defies an easy categorisation. In fact, I believe <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> is more than merely mythic or ordinary, or a combination of the two. Instead it is an imaginative space, seamlessly shifting its metaphorical meanings dependent on readings of the texts. My studies examine <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> through five common beach myths; this paper will explore the myth of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> as an egalitarian space. Contemporary Australian national texts no longer conform to these mythical representations – (in fact, was <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> ever a space of equality?), instead creating new definitions for <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> space that continually shifts in meaning. Recent texts such as Tim Winton’s Breath (2008) and Stephen Orr’s Time’s Long Ruin (2010) lay a more complex metaphorical meaning upon <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> space. This paper will explore <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> as a space of egalitarianism in conjunction with recent Australian fiction and films in order to discover how <b>the</b> contemporary <b>beach</b> is represented...|$|R

5|$|The chief {{objectives}} of Operation Dragoon were the important French ports of Marseille and Toulon, which were considered essential {{to supply the}} growing Allied forces in France. The Allied planners were cautious, taking heed of {{lessons learned from the}} Anzio and Normandy landings. They chose a location without high ground controlled by the Wehrmacht, conditions that had led to heavy casualties after the initial landings on one of <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> at Normandy. The choice for the disembarkation site was an area on the Var coast east of Toulon. A preliminary air campaign was planned to isolate the battlefield and cut the Germans off from reinforcement by destroying several key bridges. A large airborne landing was also planned {{in the center of the}} landing zone to quickly seize the high ground overlooking <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b> Parallel to the invasion, several commando units would take control of the islands off the coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E
