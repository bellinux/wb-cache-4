5|$|He {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1802 {{with a series}} of observational letters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., serialized from 1819–20. He continued to publish regularly—and almost always successfully—throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|David Elazar {{continued}} to instruct Gonen to evacuate soldiers from strongpoints {{which were not}} yet surrounded, even though by October 7 most Israeli defences were encircled. Egyptian losses up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of October 7 were only 280 killed and 20 tanks destroyed. Israeli losses were far heavier; the brigade in the Bar Lev Line was completely surrounded {{and most of its}} men were casualties while 200 were captured. Armored losses were 200–300 tanks destroyed. One source puts the losses at roughly 200 by morning, but several battalion-sized attacks to regain the forts around El-Qantarah, and to reach some of the central and southern forts incurred further casualties with over 50 tanks being destroyed. In subsequent days some of the defenders in the Bar Lev Line managed to break though Egyptian forces and return to their lines, or were extracted by Israeli forces in counterattacks that came later on.|$|E
5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon {{was buried}} beside his wife Pat {{on the grounds}} of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of the funeral service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Hiroshima {{had reached a}} peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At {{the time of the}} attack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks, beginning in 1944. Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of August 6, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Titanic {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} 14 April through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time) on Sunday, 14April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the night}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked {{to raise the}} $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E

25|$|If {{high doses}} were used more than 30 days, cut dose {{immediately}} to twice replacement, and reduce by 25% each week until replacement is reached. Then change to oral hydrocortisone or cortisone {{as a single}} morning dose, and gradually decrease by 2.5mg each week. When the morning dose is less than replacement, the return of normal basal adrenal function may be documented by checking 0800 cortisol levels prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> dose; stop drugs when 0800 cortisol is 10 μg/dl.

In an area that normally experiences a great deal of traffic, the lane closings caused a significant increase in traffic congestion. This led to major delays for school transportation and police and emergency responses within Fort Lee, both during and after the peak hours of travel.|$|E
