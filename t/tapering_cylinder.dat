40|$|A bluff body, i. e., {{an object}} with a blunt {{cross-section}} immersed in cross-flow forms an unstable wake, {{resulting in the}} formation of large-scale vortical structures, which induce unsteady forces on the body. If the body is flexible or flexibly mounted, vortex-induced vibration (VIV) results, which can have significant implications for a number of physical systems, from aeolian harps to power transmission lines, towing cables, undersea pipelines, drilling risers and mooring lines used to stabilize offshore floating platforms. VIV has been a major subject of research in recent years. The majority of these studies have focused on symmetric systems in which the structure, its geometry, its boundary conditions and the incoming flow are symmetric. However, in many real-world applications, VIV occurs in asymmetric systems. A flexibly-mounted vertical uniform circular cylinder which is placed in a uniform current {{is an example of a}} system with symmetric geometry, boundary conditions and wake. This geometry is usually considered as a canonical configuration in modeling structures undergoing VIV. However, many other configurations can exist in which the geometrical symmetry of the system is broken, such as an inclined cylinder in which the cylinder is placed with an angle with respect to the incoming flow direction, or a <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder</b> in which the diameter of the circular cylinder varies along its length, or when the geometry of the cross-section changes from circular to other shapes such as square or triangle. Also, in some other cases, such as a circular cylinder which is forced to rotate about its long axis, the symmetry of the surrounding wake is broken by the rotation imposed on the cylinder. These cases among many examples are systems with broken symmetry, and are widely used in the offshore industry. The main objective of this thesis is to study VIV of systems with broken symmetry. For this purpose, experiments are conducted and the VIV response of the systems are studied in terms of amplitude and frequency of oscillations as well as the wake of the cylinder. It is shown that higher harmonics contributions of flow forces play an important role in VIV of structures. Also, various taper ratios in VIV of <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders</b> are found to be the major parameters influencing the VIV response of <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Different rotation rates in VIV of a rotating cylinder, various angles of attack in VIV of a triangular cylinder and different angles of inclination in VIV of flexible inclined cylinder are found to be the influencing parameters in studying the VIV of structures with broken symmetry...|$|R
40|$|Forces are {{measured}} {{at both ends}} of rigid cylinders with span 60 cm, performing transverse oscillations within an oncoming stream of water, at Reynolds number Re ~ 3800. Forced harmonic motions and free vibrations of uniform and <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders</b> are studied. To study free motions, a novel force-feedback control system has been developed, consisting of: (a) a force transducer, which measures forces on a section of a cylinder moving forward at constant speed; (b) a computer using the measured force signal to drive in real time a numerical simulation of an equivalent mass-dashpot-spring system; (c) a servomotor and linear table which impose, also in real time, the numerically calculated motion on the cylinder section. The apparatus allows very low equivalent system damping and strict control of the parametric values and structure of the equivalent system. Calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient between forces at the two ends of the uniform cylinder reveals five distinct regimes {{as a function of the}} nominal reduced velocity Vrn: two regimes, for low and high values of Vrn, and far away from the value of VrS corresponding to the Strouhal frequency, show small correlation; two regimes immediately adjacent to, but excluding, VrS show strong correlation, close to 1; surprisingly, there is a regime containing the Strouhal frequency, within which correlation is low. Free vibrations with a 40 : 1 <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder</b> show that the regime of low correlation, containing the Strouhal frequency, stretches to higher reduced velocities, while lock-in starts at lower reduced velocities. When comparing the amplitude and phase of the lift coefficient measured for free and then for forced vibrations, we obtain close agreement, both for <b>tapered</b> and uniform <b>cylinders.</b> When comparing the cross-correlation coefficient however, we find that it is much higher in the forced oscillations, especially for the uniform cylinder. Hence, although the force magnitude and phase may be replicated well in forced vibrations, the correlation data suggest that differences exist between free and forced vibration cases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{has been}} {{successfully}} utilized in a towing tank facility to measure the fluid field behind a grid of intersecting cylinders, and behind a <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The study was also performed to ascertain the feasibility and applicability of using the Stereoscopic PIV technique in towing tanks, as the setup is now submerged underwater thereby limiting access to the optics once the measurement program is underway, as well as introducing complications to seeding and calibration methods. The primary challenges encountered were ensuring accurate alignment of the optics once the system is submerged, successfully seeding the area of interest in such large volumes of water, and calibrating the system accurately underwater. Results from the PIV measurement on the grid of intersecting cylinders showed {{the interaction of the}} vertical and horizontal wakes shed by the cylinders, and correctly measured that the strength of the vortical structures increased with Reynolds numbers. The results from the <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder</b> tests showed that the PIV system was able to capture the vortex dislocations present in the vortex sheet behind the cylinder. Overall, the measurements have shown that while performing stereoscopic PIV measurements in towing tank facilities is complex, it is nonetheless feasible and applicable to studying turbulent flow phenomena in such facilities. Consequently, the results from the PIV tests will be incorporated into concurrent numerically calculated results of these two test cases ongoing at the Department of Marine Technology at NTNU. This joint approach of numerical and experimental studies highlights the benefit of applying the PIV technique in the ongoing study of marine hydrodynamics at MARINTEK and NTNU...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most widely}} known {{double-action}} percussion revolver is likely the First Model Adams of 1851. This was unique {{in having a}} double-action-only mechanism, a cylinder that could quickly be removed by pulling forward {{on the front of}} the cylinder pin and slightly <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders</b> designed to take either proprietary combustable cartridges with a conical bullet designed to fit the <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder</b> or a round ball. No ramrod was provided. Another unique feature was a safety catch which held the hammer away from the percussion cap under it so it could be carried with all its 5 cylinders loaded unlike the Colt in which one of its 6 cylinders was left uncapped while carried because the hammer would rest on it which could result in a discharge if dropped. An improved version of this is the Beaumont-Adams of 1855 which has a hammer spur and a mechanism which allows single-or double-action operation. The cartridge idea had proved unpopular, so the cylinders were bored parallel for use with ball and powder and a ramrod installed on the left side of the barrel. The Beaumont-Adams differs from the Starr DA in that it is configured for a SA/DA mode. Some sources claim that Starr and Beaumont did not produce enough revolvers to be considered major players in the market. These sources claim that the first widely used DA revolver (sometimes called the first [...] "modern" [...] revolver) was the Colt 1889 [...]38 Government (.38 Long Colt) used by the Navy, and/or the improved version for the Navy and Army, the Colt 1892, because, despite wide adoption, the 1889 model was produced in relatively low numbers.|$|R
