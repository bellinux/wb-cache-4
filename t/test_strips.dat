5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether binocular saccadic eye {{movements are}} determined solely by disparity-defined slant {{or whether they}} are influenced by both disparity-defined and perceived slant. The Werner illusion was used to distinguish a plane's disparity-defined slant from its perceived slant. Three subjects viewed a horizontally elongated <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> that was flanked vertically by two planes. The perceived slant of the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> depended on the slant of the flanking planes.

The saccadic eye movements between targets on the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> were recorded both with visual feedback (“later saccades”) and without visual feedback (“first saccades”). We calculated vergence differences for saccades between targets on the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> (and for fixation on these targets). For each geometrical <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> slant we examined whether the vergence differences could be explained as an effect of perceived slant.

25|$|The cost of home {{blood glucose}} {{monitoring}} can be substantial {{due to the}} cost of the <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b> In 2006, the consumer cost of each glucose strip ranged from about $0.35 to $1.00.

A recent study on the comparative cost-effectiveness of all options for the self-monitoring of blood glucose funded by the National Health Service in the UK uncovered considerable variation in the price paid, which could not be explained by the availability of advanced meter features. It estimated that a total of £12 m was invested in providing 42 million self-monitoring of blood glucose tests with systems that fail to meet acceptable accuracy standards, and efficiency savings of £23.2 m per annum are achievable if the National Health Service were to disinvest from technologies providing lesser functionality than available alternatives, but at a much higher price.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a reagent-impregnated <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> in identifying habitual snuff users and tobacco chewers. Urine specimens were obtained from smokeless tobacco users and controls and blind tested on-site using a reagent-impregnated <b>test</b> <b>strip.</b> Samples also were sent to our university hospital lab for cotinine and nicotine analysis by gas chromatography (GC). The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> results were compared with GC results and self-reported use of snuff and chewing tobacco. A total of 61 subjects enrolled in the study: 26 snuff users, 25 tobacco chewers, and 10 nonconsumers of nicotine. Using GC assessment of nicotine and cotinine (> 200 ng/ml) as the standard, we found the sensitivity of the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> to be 96 % (25 / 26) for snuff users and 96 % (24 / 25) for tobacco chewers. When compared with self-report, the sensitivity of the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was 92. 3 % (24 / 26) for snuff users and 84 % (21 / 25) for tobacco chewers. The specificity for nonusers of nicotine was 100 % (10 / 10) for both the self-report and GC conditions. These results suggest that a reagent-impregnated <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> is a rapid, valid, and user-friendly means of differentiating smokeless tobacco users from nonconsumers of tobacco. The intensity of the pink color on the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> is proportional to the amount of nicotine or its metabolites present in urine and therefore offers a semiquantitative measure of nicotine consumption...|$|R
40|$|Fabrication of a <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for {{detection}} of benzoic acid was successfully implemented by immobilizing tyrosinase, phenol and 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) onto filter paper using polystyrene as polymeric support. The sensing scheme {{was based on}} the decreasing intensity of the maroon colour of the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> when introduced into benzoic acid solution. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was characterized using optical fiber reflectance and has maximum reflectance at 375 nm. It has shown a highly reproducible measurement of benzoic acid with a calculated RSD of 0. 47 % (n = 10). The detection was optimized at pH 7. A linear response of the biosensor was obtained in 100 to 700 ppm of benzoic acid with a detection limit (LOD) of 73. 6 ppm. At 1 : 1 ratio of benzoic acid to interfering substances, the main interfering substance is boric acid. The kinetic analyses show that, the inhibition of benzoic is competitive inhibitor and the inhibition constant (Ki) is 52. 9 ppm. The activity of immobilized tyrosinase, phenol, and MBTH in the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was fairly sustained during 20 days when stored at 3 °C. The developed <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was used for {{detection of}} benzoic acid in food samples and was observed to have comparable results to the HPLC method, hence the developed <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> can be used as an alternative to HPLC in detecting benzoic acid in food products...|$|R

25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required.

In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications.

The quantified <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> <b>tests</b> exhibited detection limits in the reference range of the 10 analytes; the assays of one firm appaered to be less sensitive.

2500|$|Accuracy of glucose meters is {{a common}} topic of {{clinical}} concern. Blood glucose meters must meet accuracy standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). According to ISO 15197 Blood glucose meters must provide results that are within ±15% of a laboratory standard for concentrations above 100mg/dL or within ±15mg/dL for concentrations below 100mg/dL at least 95% of the time. However, {{a variety of factors}} can affect the accuracy of a test. Factors affecting accuracy of various meters include calibration of meter, ambient temperature, pressure use to wipe off strip (if applicable), size and quality of blood sample, high levels of certain substances (such as ascorbic acid) in blood, hematocrit, dirt on meter, humidity, and aging of <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b> Models vary in their susceptibility to these factors and in their ability to prevent or warn of inaccurate results with error messages. The Clarke Error Grid has been a common way of analyzing and displaying accuracy of readings related to management consequences. More recently an improved version of the Clarke Error Grid has come into use: It is known as the Consensus Error Grid.

2500|$|Home glucose {{monitoring}} {{was demonstrated}} to improve glycemic control of {{type 1 diabetes}} in the late 1970s, and the first meters were marketed for home use around 1981.

2500|$|Most glucometers today use an {{electrochemical}} method. <b>Test</b> <b>strips</b> {{contain a}} capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing through the electrode {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed.
