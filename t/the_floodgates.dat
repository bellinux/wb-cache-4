5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support <b>the</b> <b>floodgates.</b> The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close <b>the</b> <b>floodgates</b> of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|The first {{effects of}} the flood began to be felt in Fairbanks late on the 29th, as the Tanana River overflowed its banks and covered low-lying areas of South Fairbanks. Thought was given on that date to closing <b>the</b> <b>floodgates</b> of the Moose Creek Dam, located on the Chena River {{as part of the}} Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, but the Chena's rise was not as rapid as that of the Tanana, which lies to the south of the town, and no action was taken on the 29th. Engineers also {{considered}} lowering the gates on the 30th, but the flow of the Chena River had not reached a level where computer models mandated the closing of the gates to protect Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|With the {{combined}} efforts of Layton, Luke, Emmy, Loosha, and the Black Ravens, the mecha is eventually defeated and Descole {{is forced to}} retreat. Despite Loosha having been fatally wounded during the fight, she proceeds to destroy <b>the</b> <b>floodgates</b> of the town's dam, drying the lake and revealing {{the entrance to the}} Golden Garden. As the group enter the garden, Loosha dies, and Arianna learns of Loosha's true intentions. Loosha knew that the clean environment of the garden would help Arianna recover from her disease, and fought the specter to ensure the garden would survive long enough to cure her. She fully recovers from her illness a year later, and the Golden Garden's discovery is then made public, marking the beginning of Layton's fame in the field of archaeology.|$|E
5|$|As Dennis {{approached}} the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, {{with the first}} from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00UTC on August16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching {{as far north as}} Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in the Florida Keys if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using <b>the</b> <b>floodgates.</b> However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, overall {{commander}} on the Western Front, {{reported to}} Hitler in October 1943 regarding the weak defences in France. This {{led to the}} appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall, with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high-tide mark. The terrain at Utah is flat, offering no high ground on which to place fortifications. The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to , depending on the tides. The Germans flooded the flat land behind the beach by damming up streams and opening <b>the</b> <b>floodgates</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Douve to admit seawater.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According to {{the current}} {{situation}} of water control project, the existing problems and the audit opinions of superior administrative departments, water control pivot of the West Bridge over the Aksu River is in urgent need of risk-elimination and reinforcement. Based on hydraulic model test, discharge capacity and sand transporting effect of floodgate and scouring sluice as well as design reasonability of energy dissipation and erosion control structure at pivot downstream have been observed and measured in risk-elimination and reinforcement of the West Bridge. It is indicated in experimental research, compared with the designed flow and checked flow in the design, the measured water levels of <b>the</b> <b>floodgate</b> are 0. 43 m and 0. 47 m lower, and measured water levels of scouring sluice are 0. 12 m and 0. 15 m lower; opening ten holes of <b>the</b> <b>floodgate</b> can take significant sand transporting effect, while scouring sluice makes insignificant sand transporting effect; {{it is suggested that}} design institute shall take erosion control measures into consideration within 100 m to <b>the</b> <b>floodgate</b> tank.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, Pollock's radical {{approach}} to painting revolutionized {{the potential for}} all Contemporary art following him. Pollock realized the journey toward making {{a work of art}} was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near {{the turn of the century}} via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined artmaking during the mid-century. Pollock's move from easel painting and conventionality liberated his contemporaneous artists and following artists. They realized Pollock's process— working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing- blasted artmaking beyond prior boundaries. Abstract expressionism expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense, the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt and others, opened <b>the</b> <b>floodgates</b> to the diversity and scope of following artworks.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, the Benbow Dam {{was built}} across the South Fork near Benbow, California, {{which led to}} the {{creation}} of a slackwater pool, Benbow Lake, and the creation of the Benbow Lake State Recreation Area. Currently, during the rainy season, <b>the</b> <b>floodgates</b> of the dam are opened, and the lake is nonexistent. The lake only exists during the summer, when lower flows are impounded behind the structure for recreation. However, as the stagnant water in the lake is typically heated by the sun to a higher temperature than normal, when it is released downstream it severely hurts salmon and steelhead runs, as well as other aquatic and migratory life. State plans to decommission the dam are underway, although its removal would severely hurt local economy. Since 2009 the dam was no longer erected, and there seem to be no plans to build the lake in future years. Dam decommissioning is occurring at the nearby Klamath, and other dams are soon to follow. The dam at Benbow Lake does not need to be decommissioned since it is only a seasonal structure when erected.|$|E
