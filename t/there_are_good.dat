5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>good</b> {{examples}} of horizontal water mills, {{also known as}} Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E

5|$|The electors of Cardinal Rolando, {{immediately}} after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized {{the assumption of}} the papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander’s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, {{which was in the}} hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>good</b> reasons to believe that it amounted six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III.|$|E

60|$|The amazing {{decision}} of the Government to employ methods quite alien to England, and rather belonging to the police of the Continent, probably arises from the appearance of papers which are lucid and fighting, like the papers of the Continent.
