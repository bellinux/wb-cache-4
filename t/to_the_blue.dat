5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} very similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> wildebeest has been discovered.

This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|M-146 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that initially served as a bypass for traffic going around Port Huron and as a short cut for traffic between U.S. Highway25 (US 25) and M-21. Later it connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Water Bridge before it was truncated to its final form. Segments of M-146 still exist today as state highways as part of Interstate94 (I-94) and I-69 and the Lapeer Connector.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E

5|$|US Highway 25A (US25A) was an {{alternate}} route near Port Huron {{that provided a}} connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Water Bridge to Canada. The highway split from its parent north of Port Huron and followed 24th Avenue south to connect to M-51 (Pine Grove Avenue) while US25 followed Lakeshore Road and Gratiot Avenue into Port Huron. The parent highway crossed under the approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Water Bridge, and the alternate route, along with M-51, provided a signed path between US25 and the bridge. The designation was created in early 1940 and was deleted when US25 was rerouted in 1963 through Port Huron and over the alternate route.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing for}} three years with minor-league {{affiliates}} for the Toronto Blue Jays and even being chosen for the 2012 Eastern League All-Star Game, Loup was called up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jays {{as a replacement for}} Luis Pérez and retired all six batters he faced. He was later voted the 2012 Toronto Blue Jays Rookie of the Year by the Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). Loup pitched 1 innings on Opening Day in 2013, and would go on to win his first major league game on April 10 against the Detroit Tigers. He recorded his first two major league saves on April 12 and June 2, and led the Blue Jays to a win in an 18-inning game on June 8 after a pair of groundouts.|$|E

5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's {{place at a}} benefit concert at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy {{was able to buy}} out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL's {{decision}} to lock out the players {{at the start}} of the 2012–13 season until a new collective bargaining agreement could be reached, Johansen was reassigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. On February 24, 2013, Johansen was re-called by the Blue Jackets for the remainder of the season, which began on January 19 after an agreement was reached. In the 2013–14 season, Johansen had a break-out year, scoring 33 goals and 30 assists for a total of 63 points, a career high. He was the third Blue Jacket in franchise history to post 30 goals or more in one season.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, US25 {{was changed}} to traffic along a one-way pairing of streets on the {{southwest}} side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Water Bridge from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. That last segment of US25 to be paved was completed near Port Hope {{at the end of}} the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, MD71 was {{involved}} in a three-route number change involving highways in three different areas of the state. MD71 was reassigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Star Memorial Highway then under construction from Queenstown to the Delaware state line; this designation lasted only three years before U.S.Route301 was rerouted onto the highway in 1959. MD71 was designated MD194 to match the adjacent numbered highway in Pennsylvania. MD194 had previously been assigned to Flower Avenue in Takoma Park; Flower Avenue was then designated MD787.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Eliminators incarcerate the fairies at the Abracatraz Prison and put Timmy's {{friends and}} family in the same cell with Timmy's godparents and Jorgen. After Poof frees the group and locates the wands, Jorgen takes {{everyone}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Moon. Timmy's friends, enemies, family, and the fairies defeat Eliminators with a combined magical attack and have a reunion with Timmy, which is interrupted when The Darkness tries to inhale him. The second wand produces no effect, and Timmy realizes he has no other choice, so he sacrifices himself into The Darkness, after sharing a kiss with his long-term crush Trixie, leaving the others to mourn.|$|E
5|$|Michael was {{perceived}} as unremarkable, quiet and good-natured. He performed the usual public duties expected of an heir to the throne. In 1901, he represented Russia at the funeral of Queen Victoria and was given the Order of the Bath. The following year he was made a Knight of the Garter in King Edward VII's coronation honours. In June 1902, Michael transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Cuirassier Regiment and moved to Gatchina, where the regiment was based. Since coming of age, Michael had assumed financial independence. His assets included the largest sugar refinery in the country, capital amounting to millions of roubles, a collection of motor vehicles, and country estates at Otrovo in Russian Poland and Brasovo near Orel.|$|E
