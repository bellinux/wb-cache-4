5000|$|Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R - CA) cited this {{research}} in the report [...] "The Oklahoma City Bombing: Was There A Foreign Connection?" [...] Within the report the following statements citing several pieces of real and circumstantial evidence were made, supporting the main theory laid out by Jayna Davis in her book. [...] "...of all the cities in the world, convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef andTerry Nichols were in Cebu City in the Philippines {{at the same time}} three months before the Oklahoma City bombing. Yousef was the perpetrator of the first World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> attack as well as the mastermind behind the planning of other high-profile attacks on Americans. Furthermore, Ramzi Yousef’s phone records, from the months before he detonated the first World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bomb</b> in early 1993, show calls placed to the Filipina neighbor and close friend of Terry Nichols’ in-laws in Queens, New York. The opportunity for interaction between American terrorist, Nichols, and al-Qaeda terrorist, Yousef, is evident." ...|$|R
5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E

Rather, you adored not Allah, but the evil that you yourself have become. And I must say that as an apostle of evil, you have been most effective.|$|R

25|$|After the 1993 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing,</b> the FBI {{began to}} {{investigate}} Omar Abdel-Rahman {{also known as}} the Blind Sheikh. The FBI recorded Rahman issuing a fatwa that encouraged acts of violence against US civilian targets, particularly in the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area. Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993. The targets were the United Nations Headquarters, the Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge, and the FBI's main New York office at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building. There were also plans to bomb Jewish targets in the city as well as assassinating U.S. Senator Al D'Amato and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.|$|E
25|$|Salameh's arrest led {{police to}} the {{apartment}} of Abdul Rahman Yasin in Jersey City, New Jersey, which Yasin was sharing with his mother, {{in the same building}} as Ramzi Yousef's apartment. Yasin was taken to the FBI's Newark field office in Newark, New Jersey, and was then released. The next day, he flew back to Iraq, via Amman, Jordan. Yasin was later indicted for the attack, and in 2001 he was placed on the initial list of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, on which he remains today. He disappeared before the U.S. coalition invasion, Operation Iraqi Freedom, in 2003.

25|$|Between 1993 and 1996, the FBI {{increased}} its counter-terrorism {{role in the}} wake of the first 1993 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> in New York City, New York; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996. Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. But Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> in February 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began to {{investigate}} Abdel-Rahman {{and his followers}} more closely. An Egyptian informant wearing a listening device for the FBI managed to record Abdel-Rahman saying he preferred attacks be concentrated on US military targets, but also stating acts of violence against civilian targets were not illicit. The most startling plan, the government charged, was to set off five bombs in 10 minutes, blowing up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and a federal building housing the FBI. Government prosecutors showed videotapes of the defendants mixing bomb ingredients in a garage before their arrest in 1993. Abdel-Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993, along with nine of his followers. On 1 October 1995, {{he was convicted of}} seditious conspiracy, solicitation to murder Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, conspiracy to murder President Mubarak, solicitation to attack a U.S. military installation, and conspiracy to conduct bombings; in 1996 he was sentenced to life in solitary confinement without parole.|$|E

25|$|Two major {{pieces of}} {{legislation}} passed in 1996 {{had a significant effect}} on illegal immigration and deportations in the United States; the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). These were introduced following the 1993 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing</b> and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, both of which were terrorist attacks that claimed American lives. These two acts changed the way criminal cases of lawful permanent residents were handled, resulting in increased deportations from the United States. Before the 1996 deportation laws, there were two steps that lawful permanent noncitizen residents who were convicted of crimes went through. The first step determined whether or not the person was deportable. The second step determined if that person should or shouldn't be deported. Before the 1996 deportation laws, the second step prevented many permanent residents from being deported by allowing for their cases to be reviewed in full before issuing deportations. External factors were taken into consideration such as the effect deportation would have on a person's family members and a person's connections with their country of origin. Under this system permanent residents were able to be relieved of deportation if their situation deemed it unnecessary. The 1996 laws however issued many deportations under the first step, without going through the second step, resulting in a great increase in deportations.|$|E
25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> <b>bombing.</b> The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E
