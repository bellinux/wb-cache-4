5|$|At the Australian Open, Djokovic and Murray both {{suffered}} defeats prior the quarterfinals. Nadal and Federer, meanwhile, both reached another Australian Open final; for Nadal it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{reached this}} stage since winning the 2014 French Open. Both came through tough five-set semi-final matches {{to make the}} final. In the Australian Open final, a second consecutive five-set match for both players, Federer triumphed over arch-rival Nadal, winning an 18th men's singles Grand Slam title.|$|E

5|$|Heskey {{signed for}} Aston Villa on 23 January 2009 for a £3.5million fee on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him starting 14th and marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue his point scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino {{and a lack of}} grip in Spain meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the French Open, Murray beat world No. 9, Nikolay Davydenko at the Monte Carlo Masters, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> beaten a top ten {{player on}} clay, though he lost to Nadal in the semifinals. Murray was upset in round {{two of the}} Rome Masters by {{qualifier}} Juan Mónaco, and he reached {{the quarterfinals of the}} Madrid Masters, losing to Juan Martín del Potro. During this time Murray achieved the highest ever ranking of a British male in the Open Era when he became world No. 3 on 11 May 2009. Murray reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, but was defeated by Fernando González in four sets.|$|E

On 10 February, Del Piero broke the club's record for most goals in a single season, scoring his eleventh goal {{of the season in}} a 2–1 home win over Brisbane Roar. Despite his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in 24 appearances, Del Piero was unable to help Sydney qualify for the play-offs {{at the end of the}} season. On 21 February, Del Piero renewed his contract until 2014.|$|E

On April 24, Zito stifled the St. Louis Cardinals, throwing eight shutout innings with ten strikeouts for his third victory of the season, en route to starting the season 5–0 {{for the first time}} in his career. It was the best start by a Giants' pitcher since 2004, when Lowry started 6–0. On June 12, 2010, Zito earned his first win against his former team, the Athletics, which gave him victories against every MLB team.|$|E

5|$|By his standards, Roger Federer had a weak season: {{he failed}} to win a Grand Slam tournament title {{for the first time}} since 2002, losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final, and the sixth time overall in Major finals. He dropped to world No. 4 in November, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002. Federer's drop was caused by Murray's {{remarkable}} run of form in Asia in October, winning three successive titles. However, Federer rallied, winning his three final tournaments (a sign of things to come in the subsequent season), including the World Tour Finals, which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3. Murray, meanwhile, was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final against Djokovic. He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year, and five titles in total.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.|$|E

5|$|Jarre's {{follow-up}} album, Équinoxe, {{was released}} in 1978. It was composed with sequencers, particularly on the bass, and features a more baroque and classical style than Oxygène, with more emphasis on melodic development. Though its sales were still very healthy, it had less of an impact than Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a new world record for {{the largest number of}} spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1million spectators. Although it was not <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and introduced the Frenchman to Francis Rimbert, who worked for Jarre during two decades on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Markino Buckley {{competed for}} Jamaica in the men's 400meters hurdles. He had been {{affiliated}} with the MVP Track and Field Club, {{which is based in}} the capital city of Kingston. At the time of his performance in Beijing, Buckley was 22 years old; his participation in Beijing marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever participated in an Olympic games. During the August 15 qualifications, he was placed in the third heat. Buckley completed the run in 48.65seconds, placing first in a heat of six people. South Africa's LJ van Zyl placed second (48.86seconds), while Poland's Marek Plawgo placed third (49.17seconds). Out of the 25 finishing competitors in the qualification round, Buckley ranked first. Fellow Jamaican Danny McFarlane placed third in the event at around 0.2seconds slower than Buckley did. He advanced to the semifinal round, which took place on August 16.|$|E
5|$|No. 80 Squadron was re-equipped with newer model Hawker Hurricane Mk Is on 20 February 1941. That day, Pattle, flying Hurricane Mk I V7724, {{was leading}} {{a group of}} six Hurricanes escorting 16 Blenheim light bombers — eight from No. 84 Squadron RAF, six from No. 211 Squadron and three from No. 30 Squadron RAF—to Berat. Fiat G.50bis from the 361a and 395a Squadriglia, 154° Autonomo Gruppo were {{scrambled}} from Berat airfield, but they were attacked by the higher altitude Hurricanes. Pattle led his section straight towards four Fiat G.50s and selected the leading aircraft as his own target. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fired the eight guns of the Hurricane, and the G.50 exploded. The Fiat G.50 was from 154° Gruppo {{and it was the}} first Hurricane victory that Pattle would claim. Tenente Livio Bassi was killed in this battle. Another CR.42 fell to Pattle on 27 February 1941 — his 17th victory. His Hurricane sustained a bullet hole in the fuel tank.|$|E
