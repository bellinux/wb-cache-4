40|$|Listeners use lexical {{knowledge}} {{to adjust their}} prelexical representations of speech sounds {{in response to the}} idiosyncratic pronunciations of particular speakers. We used an exposure-test paradigm to investigate whether this type of perceptual learning transfers across syllabic positions. No significant learning effect was found in Experiment 1, where exposure sounds were onsets and <b>test</b> <b>sounds</b> were codas. Experiments 2 - 4 showed that there was no learning even when both exposure and <b>test</b> <b>sounds</b> were onsets. But a trend was found when exposure sounds were codas and <b>test</b> <b>sounds</b> were onsets (Experiment 5). This trend was smaller than the robust effect previously found for the coda-to-coda case.

Although this "enhancement" effect was initially thought to be purely monaural, it is also observable when the <b>test</b> <b>sound</b> and the precursor sound are presented contralaterally (i. e., to opposite ears). In experiment 1, we assessed the magnitude of ipsilateral and contralateral enhancement {{as a function of}} the time interval between the precursor and test sounds (10, 100, or 600 ms). The <b>test</b> <b>sound,</b> randomly transposed in frequency from trial to trial, was followed by a probe tone, either matched or mismatched in frequency to the <b>test</b> <b>sound</b> component which was the target of enhancement. Listeners' ability to discriminate matched probes from mismatched probes was taken as an index of enhancement magnitude. The results showed that enhancement decays more rapidly for ipsilateral than for contralateral precursors, suggesting that ipsilateral enhancement and contralateral enhancement stem from at least partly different sources. It could be hypothesized that, in experiment 1, contralateral precursors were effective only because they provided attentional cues about the target tone frequency. In experiment 2, this hypothesis was tested by presenting the probe tone before the precursor sound rather than after the <b>test</b> <b>sound.</b> Although the probe tone was then serving as a frequency cue, contralateral precursors were again found to produce enhancement.

40|$|Vibratory mode of {{the infant}} skull was {{observed}} and analysed by holography to elucidate the mechanism of bone-conduction hearing in the childhood. Three dried human infant skulls, one of six months, two of eight months postnatal age, were used. As the cranial suture was incomplete with the wide fonticulus remaining and the composition was not so dense or strong {{as that of the}} adult, very careful manipulation was needed in the experiment with the infant skull. Consequently, an acoustic loud-speaker was utilized to make the infant skull vibrate in the free sound field, instead of using direct vibrator conventionally attached to the adult skull for the measurement of vibration. An area around the foramen occipitale magnum was fixed by means of bolts, and the skull was stood on a table. Attempts were made to change the frequency and intensity of the test sounds during the experiment. The sound pressure level of the sound field was measured with a noise meter. The value measured {{at the site of the}} skull closest to the loud-speaker was regarded as the intensity of the <b>test</b> <b>sound.</b> The resulting pattern of vibration was recorded and reconstructed by holographic interferometry. As the light source for holography helium-neon laser was used. Interference fringes were observed at 110 phon or more of the intensities of the test sounds. When frequency of the test tone was low such that 500 Hz or less, interference fringes of parallel lines were observed in the hologram. This meant the skull was found to vibrate as a whole, and the sound signal seemed to be transmitted by "inertia bone-conduction" in the mechanism of hearing when the frequency of the <b>test</b> <b>sound</b> was 500 Hz or less. on the other hand, at 1 kHz and more of the test frequency, the vibratory pattern changed into concentric fringes with multiple maximum points of amplitude.
