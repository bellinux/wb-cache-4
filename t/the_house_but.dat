5|$|Hańska met {{the painter}} Jean Gigoux when she hired him in 1851 to paint Anna's portrait. They began a {{relationship}} that lasted many years, but never married. Over the next thirty years, Hańska and particularly her spend-thrift daughter spent the remainder of their fortune on fine clothing and jewelry. Jerzy, meanwhile, succumbed to mental disorders and died in 1881, leaving behind a trail of debts. Hańska was forced to sell <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>but</b> was allowed to continue living there. She died on 11 April 1882 and was buried in Balzac's grave at Père Lachaise Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and Rory, {{while taking}} the lift down, {{suddenly}} {{find themselves in}} {{what appears to be}} an eighteenth-century house, but shortly discover most of the furnishings are wooden props. Other residents of the estate appear in <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>but</b> are caught by life-sized peg dolls that laugh and sing like children, and transform the residents into more dolls. Amy and Rory witness one transformation and try to flee, but Amy is caught and becomes a doll herself, joining the others in chasing Rory.|$|E

5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} against U.S. Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> was ignored by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of the house in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|The Tories {{finished}} with 112seats to the Liberals' 105, while both the CCF and Social Credit gained seats in Western Canada and {{finished with}} 25 and 19seats respectively. Nine cabinet ministers, including Howe, Marler, Garson, Campney and Harris were defeated. Though the Liberals outpolled the Tories by over 100,000votes, most of those votes were wasted running up huge margins in Quebec. St. Laurent could have constitutionally hung onto power until defeated in <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> he chose not to, and John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect was}} to {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant’s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>but</b> failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open to charges of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine’s purpose of rallying Protestants to the Republican party and promoting himself as one of the party’s foremost leaders.|$|E

5|$|The wound severed Sharp's aorta, {{killing him}} almost instantly.

Returning to the site where he had buried a change of clothes, he stripped off his disguise, tied it up with a rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River. In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.|$|E

5|$|A speaker for the Anti-Saloon League, Barkley co-{{sponsored}} the 1916 Sheppard–Barkley Act which banned alcohol {{sales in}} Washington, D.C. It {{was passed in}} 1917. He sponsored {{an amendment to the}} Lever Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> a conference committee amended it to allow production of beer and wine. Both measures increased Barkley's national visibility and set the stage for future prohibition legislation, including the Eighteenth Amendment. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists' enthusiasm. He also showed little interest in the faction's attempts to recruit him to challenge incumbent anti-prohibition Senator Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic primary.|$|E

Addie warns them not to enter <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>but</b> they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.|$|E

5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>but</b> later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>but</b> Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>but</b> retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|In Garrard's November 5, 1798, State of the Commonwealth address, he {{encouraged}} the General Assembly to declare its {{views on the}} Alien and Sedition Acts. Breckinridge was chosen as chairman of a three-person committee {{to carry out the}} governor's charge. The resolutions that the committee brought to the floor on November 10 became known as the Kentucky Resolutions. The first seven were exactly as Jefferson had written them, but Breckinridge modified the last two, eliminating Jefferson's suggestion of nullifying the unpopular acts. During the debate on the House floor, Breckinridge endorsed nullification if Congress would not repeal the acts after a majority of states declared their opposition to them. Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>but</b> was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate. Upon concurrence of both houses, Garrard signed the resolutions.|$|E
