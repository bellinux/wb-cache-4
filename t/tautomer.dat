40|$|Nucleobases in DNA and RNA are {{important}} {{building blocks of}} the genetic codes and are critical in transferring genetic information. In general, nucleobases have many tautomers; but in DNA and RNA molecules they are mainly presented in the most stable forms. Uncommon <b>tautomers</b> can cause mispairing of base pairs to form irregular structures of DNA and RNA that lead to spontaneous mutations during replication. Thus, systematic studies of nucleobase <b>tautomers</b> are very important in understanding the structures and the characteristics of DNA and RNA. This review summarizes the experimental and theoretical studies in the literature and our density functional calculations on all the nucleobase <b>tautomers.</b> The relative energies of nucleobase <b>tautomers</b> and the structures of their lowest-energy <b>tautomers</b> from our calculations are in good agreement with the experimental values in the literature.

The equilibrium constant for enolisation is approximately 10−13, meaning that only one in every ten trillion molecules is in the keto form at any moment. The small amount of stabilisation gained by exchanging a C=C bond for a C=O bond is more than offset by the large destabilisation resulting from the loss of aromaticity. Phenol therefore exists essentially entirely in the enol form.|$|E

The optimized structures and energies for 6 <b>tautomers</b> and 6 transition states of thymine radical cation are calculated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level.

The roles of hydration are also investigated with thymine-water 1 : 1 complex ions.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of alkali metal with thymine {{is an interesting}} target of studies in connection with bioinorganic chemistry and biological chemistry of toxicity and carcinogenicity. We studied interactions {{of one of the}} oxo groups of thymine and its <b>tautomers</b> with alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) by ab initio calculations. The stability of these species has been studied in gas and solution phases. Characterization of intermolecular (C=O) and intramolecular (C-N) bonds has been studied with the NBO method and, the interactions that cause the strongest stabilization have been studied, as well. The stability of metalated thymine and its <b>tautomers</b> has been studied thermochemically. The present study reports the quantum chemistry analysis of the metal-assisted tautomerization. Ab initio and DFT methods at the HF and B 3 LYP levels of theory were used. Interactions of alkali metals with oxo group of thymine and its <b>tautomers</b> stabilize rare <b>tautomers</b> compared to the major form. Investigation of interactions in solution phase shows that with increasing dielectric constants of solvent, the <b>tautomers</b> are stabilizing compared to the major form. Thermochemical analysis shows that the stability of metalated thymine is more for less electropositive metals. These results show that basicity of metalated thymine has been increased. NBO calculations show that in metalated thymine (1, metalated), (5, metalated) the N 2 and N 4 lone pair is seen to be the lowest occupancy and highest energy Lewis NBO and to be primarily delocalized into antibonds the vicinal π* C 3 -O 3 and π* C 1 -O 1 NBO, respectively. In other species lowest occupancy and highest energy Lewis NBO depend on alkali metal.

Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small changes in pH suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol tautomeric relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2).
