5|$|Tracey Macleod ate at Pétrus for The Independent {{shortly after}} {{it opened in}} 1999. She thought that certain touches would impress the Michelin inspectors, and that <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> were {{suitably}} elaborate. Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst {{it was at the}} Bekerley Hotel in 2003 for The Observer. He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her main course of baked seabass with garlic puree.|$|E

5|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} star was first awarded. It has {{received}} mixed reviews from food critics both while {{in its current}} incarnation, and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing. It was felt that <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> were sometimes overcomplicated, and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars. The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus.|$|E
50|$|Granny Park Mu-Sun is {{believed}} to be the creator of <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> which was nicknamed as Mugyo-Dong. She first revealed <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> at a tavern at Korean Export Insurance Corporation located in Seorin-dong, Seoul in 1965. Soon, restaurants adopted <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> and because of the large demand of <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> she opened a branch named Nakji Center in 1972.|$|R

5000|$|Rost is {{a famous}} Bengali dish {{originating}} in Bangladesh. <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> {{is influenced by}} the Persian cuisine left behind by the Mughal Empire. <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> is known for including a large array of spices and ingredients and being a little sweet and very rich. <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> is made during almost all celebratory times in Bengal especially during Eid al-Fitr where it is an important dish always included, however, <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> is made anytime important guests are coming over. <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> is very popularly made in restaurants in Dhaka, Rajshahi and Bogra.|$|R
5|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell is an English cookery book by the cookery and {{housekeeping}} writer Thomas Dawson, {{first published}} in 1585. It includes recipes for medicines as well as food. To the spices found in Medieval English cooking, the book adds herbs, especially parsley and thyme.

5|$|To {{celebrate}} the 45th {{anniversary of the}} restaurant in 2008, Gueller recreated elements of the 1963 menu, but decided not to make certain dishes such as chicken chasseur or melon boats. Other parts of the original menu included crêpes and half a grilled grapefruit. <b>The</b> <b>dishes</b> selected were included for {{a week in a}} six course 1960s set menu.|$|E
5|$|Legal Sea Foods, an East Coast of the United States {{restaurant}} chain has arranged to purchase green crabs in season from local fishermen, {{in the first}} known commercial use for the crabs in the US food industry. Legal plans to test crab and shrimp etouffee, crab risotto with spring vegetables, and crab minestrone, all made with green crab stock, in their test kitchen {{during the winter of}} 2015 and offer <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> in their other restaurant locations during the crab season.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dish</b> {{is simple}} {{to make and}} the {{ingredients}} needed are easily obtainable, which may account for <b>the</b> <b>dish's</b> popularity. Many of the ingredients used—olive oil, sumac and pine nuts—are frequently found in Palestine cuisine. <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> is also popular in Levant, particularly among Palestinians.|$|R
5000|$|Its 60-foot dish, {{which could}} both {{transmit}} and receive, {{was used for}} important research programs in propagation and ionospheric forecasting which were used during a number of Apollo space launches to predict solar activity that might hamper communications from the ground to the space capsules. The building located at the lower right of <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> housed a turbine-powered alternator used to provide power for <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> operation. There was insufficient power available from the national grid. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> was computer controlled by an operator located in the building below <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> movements were monitored by close-circuit television.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dish</b> is also {{popular in}} Cambodian cuisine, where <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> is called [...] (most often transliterated as banh chao).|$|R
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} White sought to leave Harveys was {{that the size of}} the kitchen was {{insufficient}} to allow him to expand the range of techniques in <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> he served. With the move to The Restaurant, he added dishes with techniques such as confit, braising and en vessie highlighted. The move also saw an expansion to the number of different options served; while Harveys may have had a handful of main courses, this was increased to around 15 or more at The Restaurant. White's concept for the food was simplified versions of classical French cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The six {{pieces of}} painted Italian maiolica, or painted and tin-glazed earthenware, are all {{larger than the}} average, and there are none of <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> that {{are the most common}} maiolica shape. The {{earliest}} piece is a large statue of Fortuna standing on a dolphin, holding a sail, by Giovanni della Robbia, made in Florence about 1500–10. This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest.|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Kenyatta {{left home}} and {{enrolled}} as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. He informed the British missionaries based {{there that he}} wished to learn from them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught {{to read and write}} in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> and weeding the gardens. Several months after arriving, Kenyatta was taken ill with tuberculosis. Kenyatta was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in which most of the British missionaries treated them.|$|E

5|$|The Nobu Restaurant {{features}} an Asian motif and is spaciously arranged with only round tables, granting larger aisles than square tables would. Large paper lamps in jellyfish images {{hang from the}} ceiling. Seating {{is available in the}} main dining area, the sushi bar, along a couple of high kitchen tables, or in a private dining area. There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with the menu and dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was {{successful}} enough for Lehmann to commission David {{to write a}} sequel, to show <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> of rural France. This was French Country Cooking, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for Go, before returning to London.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream meat pie was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E

50|$|Fans of <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> have {{included}} Franklin D. Roosevelt, who introduced it to George S. Patton. It was Patton's love for <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> which subsequently resulted in it being added {{in his honor}} to the U.S. Army's Meal, Ready-to-Eat field rations in 2000. A variety of Southern chefs have recipes for <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> including Paul Prudhomme, Paula Deen and Emeril Lagasse. <b>The</b> <b>dish</b> was featured on an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay in season 6 guest-starring Matt and Ted Lee. It also appeared on the BBC One cooking show, Saturday Kitchen, with chef Atul Kochhar cooking the regular chicken and rice version of <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|R
5|$|When White {{retired in}} December 1999, he gave back the Michelin stars, but under Robert Reid, The Restaurant won a single star {{again in the}} 2001 and 2002 editions of the guide before closing later that year. During the course of The Restaurant's two locations, White sought to develop the {{techniques}} used in <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> and expand the range of food on offer. The space used at Harveys was inadequate for his plans, but with the Hyde Park Hotel location {{he was able to}} add elements which were braised or made confit. At the Oak Room, both chickens and lamb were cooked each day just for pressed juices with which to make sauces for other dishes. The Restaurant was critically acclaimed, with critics such as Michael Winner, A. A. Gill and Jonathan Meades praising the food served. As did Egon Ronay, who gave the restaurant a maximum three stars in his restaurant guide.|$|E
