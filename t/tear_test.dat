As the zero-span test is a widely accepted method of measurement of fibre strength within a sheet [42], it was the method of choice, although the role of inter-fibre bonding in this property is still not fully understood [43].

40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} is made into the fracture properties of polymer films and laminates under cutting by a sharp tool and lateral tension under pure shear conditions. The method involves {{use of a}} sharp razor blade applied to the crack tip of polymer films which are also stretched orthogonal to {{the direction of the}} blade. The reaction force is measured as the cutting tool cuts the material and the force from applying a lateral strain is measured. The analysis and tests assume quasi-static conditions. The method is applied to a polyester film and three polyester laminates. Steady-state cutting forces are observed from cutting tests and loads at crack initiation are observed from lateral stretching tests. With fracture mechanics analysis the energy contributions from cutting and tearing are used to determine apparent fracture properties from the experimental results. It is observed that the cutting and <b>tearing</b> <b>tests</b> yield similar fracture toughness properties for the three tested polyester laminates, despite the different crack tip geometry at the point of crack growth.
