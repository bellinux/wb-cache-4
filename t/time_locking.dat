6000|$|To {{show that}} such {{rational}} and serious differences do exist, I will take one instance from that Bill which proposed to protect {{families and the}} public generally from the burden of feeble-minded persons. Now, even if I could share the Eugenic contempt for human rights, even if I could start gaily on the Eugenic campaign, I should not begin by removing feeble-minded persons. I have known as many families in as many classes as most men; and I cannot remember meeting any very monstrous human suffering arising out {{of the presence of}} such insufficient and negative types. There seem to be comparatively few of them; and those few by no means the worst burdens upon domestic happiness. I do not hear of them often; I do not hear of them doing much more harm than good; and in the few cases I know well they are not only regarded with human affection, but can be put to certain limited forms of human use. Even if I were a Eugenist, then I should not personally elect to waste my <b>time</b> <b>locking</b> up the feeble-minded. The people I should lock up would be the strong-minded. I have known hardly any cases of mere mental weakness making a family a failure; I have known eight or nine cases of violent and exaggerated force of character making a family a hell. If the strong-minded could be segregated it would quite certainly be better for their friends and families. And if there is really anything in heredity, {{it would be better for}} posterity too. For the kind of egoist I mean is a madman in a much more plausible sense than the mere harmless [...] "deficient"; and to hand on the horrors of his anarchic and insatiable temperament is a much graver responsibility than to leave a mere inheritance of childishness. I would not arrest such tyrants, because I think that even moral tyranny in a few homes is better than a medical tyranny turning the state into a madhouse. I would not segregate them, because I respect a man's free-will and his front-door and his right to be tried by his peers. But since free-will is believed by Eugenists no more than by Calvinists, since front-doors are respected by Eugenists no more than by house-breakers, and since the Habeas Corpus is about as sacred to Eugenists as it would be to King John, why do not they bring light and peace into so many human homes by removing a demoniac from each of them? Why do not the promoters of the Feeble-Minded Bill call at the many grand houses in town or country where such nightmares notoriously are? Why do they not knock at the door and take the bad squire away? Why do they not ring the bell and remove the dipsomaniac prize-fighter? I do not know; and there is only one reason I can think of, which must remain a matter of speculation. When I was at school, the kind of boy who liked teasing half-wits was not the sort that stood up to bullies.|$|E

40|$|In gas {{chromatography}} (GC) reproducible retention times {{are in many}} cases highly favorable {{or in some cases}} even required. In one-dimensional GC, retention time shifts can be eliminated or minimized using a procedure called retention <b>time</b> <b>locking</b> (RTL). This procedure is based on adjusting the (constant) column head pressure. Unfortunately, this RTL procedure cannot be used in comprehensive two-dimensional {{gas chromatography}} (GC × GC) given the fact that peaks will shift in both dimensions. Adjusting the column head pressure in GC × GC will only minimize or eliminate the primary retention time shifts. In this paper, a fast and easy to perform, two-step retention <b>time</b> <b>locking</b> procedure for two-dimensional gas chromatography (2 D-RTL) is proposed and its feasibility is demonstrated. This 2 D-RTL procedure involves adjustment of the column head pressure or constant column flow, followed by the adjustment of the so-called effective secondary column length. The secondary column length is increased or decreased, simply by moving it stepwise through the modulator. It is demonstrated that retention time shifts in both the primary- and secondary-dimension, which may occur after e. g. replacing the column set, can be minimized to less than half peak base width. The proposed 2 D-RTL procedure is used successfully for approximately 1 year in our laboratory...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for screening level ecological risk assessment. In this paper, we first established a mass spectrum library including 50 phenols using retention <b>time</b> <b>locking</b> (RTL) technology and deconvolution reporting software (DRS). Distribution of phenols in surface water of the Taihu Lake was screened. Among the 22 identified phenols, 14 phenols were quantified. The concentrations of total phenols ranged 675. 2 - 3346. 1 ng L(- 1). The distributions of ecological effect quotients (EEQs) of 14 phenols were characterized {{in terms of the}} exposure concentration distributions (ECDs) and species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Those phenols with EEQs exceeding the threshold proposed by Water Environment Research Foundation of Alexandria were selected as priorities. As a result, 2 -nitrophenol (2 -NP), p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX) and pyrocatechol were determined as potential ecological risk stressors in surface water of the Taihu Lake. Results of the present study suggested that the proposed approach is feasible for the screening level ecological risk assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Long‐range gamma band EEG {{oscillations}} mediate {{information transmission}} between distant brain regions. Gamma band‐based coupling {{may not be}} restricted to cortex‐to‐cortex communication but may include extracortical parts of the visual system. The retinogram and visual event‐related evoked potentials exhibit time‐locked, forward propagating oscillations that are candidates of gamma oscillatory coupling between the retina and the visual cortex. In this study, we tested if this gamma coupling is present {{as indicated by the}} coherence of gamma‐range (70 – 200  Hz) oscillatory potentials (OPs) recorded simultaneously from the retina and the primary visual cortex in freely moving, adult rats. We found significant retino‐cortical OP coherence {{in a wide range of}} stimulus duration (0. 01 – 1000  msec), stimulus intensity (800 – 5000  mcd/mm 2), interstimulus interval (10 – 400  msec), and stimulus frequency (0. 25 – 25  Hz). However, at low stimulus frequencies, the OPs were time‐locked, flickering light at 25  Hz entrained continuous OP coherence (steady‐state response, SSR). Our results suggest that the retina and the visual cortex exhibit oscillatory coupling at high‐gamma frequency with precise <b>time</b> <b>locking</b> and synchronization of information transfer from the retina to the visual cortex, similar to cortico‐cortical gamma coupling. The temporal fusion of retino‐cortical gamma coherence at stimulus rates of theater movies may explain the mechanism of the visual illusion of continuity. How visual perception depends on early transformations of ascending sensory information is incompletely understood. By simultaneous measurement of flash‐evoked potentials in the retina and the visual cortex in awake, freely moving rats, we demonstrate for the first time that time‐locked gamma oscillatory potentials exhibit stable retino‐cortical synchrony across a wide range of stimulus parameters and that the temporal continuity of coherence changes with stimulus frequency according to the expected change in the visual illusion of continuity. The retina and the visual cortex exhibit oscillatory coupling at high‐gamma frequency with precise <b>time</b> <b>locking</b> and synchronization of information transfer from the retina to the visual cortex, similar to cortico‐cortical gamma coupling.
