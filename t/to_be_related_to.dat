5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} Eocene to Oligocene epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance. (They are now thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> hippopotamus and pigs). Three models were made, forming a small herd.|$|E

5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E

5|$|Alex George {{described}} {{the plant in}} his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia as a variety of Banksia integrifolia, but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic studies show it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Banksia plagiocarpa, Banksia oblongifolia and Banksia robur. The species is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E

The role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood; their functions are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> RNA synthesis and packaging in the virion, mRNA transport {{to the site of}} genome replication, and mRNA translation and regulation of gene expression.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle.

In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> {{its effects on}} the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers.

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of chief audit {{executives}} and internal audit managers from 19 countries, we investigate potential associations between cultural dimensions and variations in perceived use/compliance {{with the internal}} auditing standards.

Among control variables, we find positive associations {{for the length of}} Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) membership, professional certification in internal auditing, and hours of continuing professional education (CPE) training on both perceived use and compliance. Finally, we find “Cost of compliance” and “Compliance not expected in my country” <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inversely <b>related</b> <b>to</b> perceived use/compliance.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether certain symptoms of autism were associated with enhanced performance on a conjunctive visual search task. Thirty individuals with autism completed the AQ and a conjunctive-search task.

Attention <b>to</b> detail <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the slope in the target-present condition, suggesting that better attention <b>to</b> detail <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> less distraction with increasing set size.
