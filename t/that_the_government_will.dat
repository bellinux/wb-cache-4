25|$|Despite its prominence, the {{existence}} of a large, open gay community in Zona Rosa still creates controversy. Some, such {{as the president of the}} Agrupacion de Comericantes de la Zona Rosa (Acozoro), Mariano Molina, state that the presence of an open gay community drives away visitors and customers who are not accustomed to seeing gay couples in public. Others state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> not work to save the area because of the gay bars and Mexico’s ethic of machismo.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the edges}} of south eastern towns, {{perfectly}} good agricultural land often remains uncultivated {{as a result of}} price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt.

25|$|Still, as the U.S. economy {{begins to}} recover, America {{might still be}} too skeptical to {{increase}} imports from Mexico right away.

It is expected that within the next ten years, land use development in Santa Maria will represent the sub-urban mix which means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> provide development where the level of accessibility is very high.

25|$|Mexico City {{is still}} the cultural, economic, and {{industrial}} center for the nation. With a metropolitan-area population approaching 20 million, roughly equivalent to {{the entire state of}} Texas, it is a magnet of growth.

The provision of water and wastewater service for the growing population of Mexico City is the problem air pollution was in the 1970s and 1980s.

25|$|The Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} in 3-0 {{ruling on}} July 17, 2013 Judge’s Forrest ruling which struck down § 1021(b)(2) {{of the controversial}} U.S. military-detention law NDAA as unconstitutional because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Court of Appeals overturned Forrest’s decision in a 60-page ruling and lifted her injunction, saying that Christopher Hedges and another plaintiff weren’t eligible to challenge the law because it “simply says nothing about the government’s authority to detain citizens.” The court held that under their interpretation the government could not use the particular law challenged by the citizen plaintiffs to militarily detain them, so they had no basis for the court to hear their case. But the court acknowledged that this doesn’t mean that the government could not rely on other laws, including the AUMF {{to the events of}} September 11, to justify indefinite military detention of citizens. The court concluded that the non-citizen plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of being detained and thus could not have their challenge of the law adjudicated by the court. “And while Section 1021 does have a real bearing on those who are neither citizens nor lawful resident aliens and who are apprehended abroad, the non-citizen plaintiffs also have failed to establish standing because they have not shown a sufficient threat <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> detain them under Section 1021,” the court said.|$|E

He further added that in recent years, Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture.

Though Javert tells the students <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>will</b> not attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that {{all the people of}} Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E
