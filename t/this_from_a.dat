5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E

As a result, he starts his own childproofing crusade, selling cheap but safe and effective products and making Springfield safe for children. However, this causes the baby-injury-related business in Springfield to go in decline. Homer feels bad for making people such as pediatricians lose their jobs and thus he ends his childproofing career.|$|E
25|$|Baker Street Mill {{is said to}} {{have been}} built in 1765, {{although}} a date of 1762 is recorded in the mill. The earliest firm reference for the mill is 1796, <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sale notice in 1808. It is likely that the mill was raised a storey between 1762 and 1814. The mill was working by wind until 1914. A steam mill was built near the mill towards the end of its working life, a new boiler being supplied in 1906.|$|E

Jaworski incurred <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second quarter. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon the sight of the Big J and didn't know what hit them, eventually losing to the Gins.|$|E
25|$|The provincial {{government}} and police were criticised by the locals for having allowed the attack to take place, especially since police roadblocks {{on the way}} to Beslan were removed shortly before the attack. Many blamed rampant corruption that allowed the attackers to bribe their way through the checkpoints; in fact, this was even what they had openly boasted to their hostages. Others say the militants took the back roads used by smugglers in collusion with the police. Yulia Latynina alleged that Major Gurazhev was captured after he approached the militants' truck to demand a bribe for what he thought was an oil-smuggling operation. It was also alleged the federal police knew of the time and place of the planned attack; according to internal police documents obtained by Novaya Gazeta, the Moscow MVD knew about the hostage taking four hours in advance, having learned <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> militant captured in Chechnya. According to Basayev, the road to Beslan was cleared of roadblocks because the FSB planned to ambush the group later, believing the rebels' aim was to seize the parliament of North Ossetia in Vladikavkaz.|$|E

Peter, having found out about <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> letter by Apraksin, decided it to be [...] "very significant, but also very dangerous." [...] In the end he left the decision up to General Apraksin who, not wanting to bear the responsibility for a failure, decided to wait for reinforcements to arrive by sea once the ice had opened up.|$|E

500|$|The Queen waited {{over three}} months before signing the death warrant; this delay is {{sometimes}} interpreted {{as evidence that the}} Queen doubted the case against her doctor. Lopez, Ferreira da Gama and Tinoco were hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn on 7 June 1594. Lopez insisted to the end that he was innocent and that his professed Christian faith was genuine. He fell into a state of depression, but on the scaffold gathered his resolve and, according to the 16th-century historian William Camden, declared that [...] "he loved the Queen as well as he loved Jesus Christ".

500|$|At age six, Andrić began primary school. He later recounted {{that these}} were the happiest days of his life. At the age of ten, he {{received}} a three-year scholarship from a Croat cultural group called Napredak (Progress) to study in Sarajevo. In the autumn of 1902, he was registered at the Great Sarajevo Gymnasium (...) , the oldest secondary school in Bosnia. While in Sarajevo, Andrić lived with his mother, who worked in a rug factory. At the time, the city was overflowing with civil servants {{from all parts of}} Austria-Hungary, and thus many languages could be heard in its restaurants, cafés and on its streets. Culturally, the city boasted a strong Germanic element, and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect <b>this.</b> <b>From</b> <b>a</b> total of 83 teachers that worked at Andrić's school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. [...] "The teaching program," [...] biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, [...] "was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [...] Monarchy." [...] Andrić disapproved. [...] "All that came... at secondary school and university," [...] he wrote, [...] "was rough, crude, automatic, without concern, faith, humanity, warmth or love." ...|$|E

[...] Lamar Hafildason of the BBC gave the film one out of five stars, saying: [...] "Sadly, the BBC does not pay out for one-word reviews. If it did, then this review would read simply: 'tiresome'."

Egon Olsen learns about <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lawyer who is serving prison time, and the gang interferes with the plan to secure the millions for themselves.

2500|$|Since {{this is the}} {{shortest}} mention of the decree available, [...] "the label [...] seems to have stuck". The actual wording of the decree was however longer, Gerhard Plaumann gives it as [...] "de ea re ita censuere: uti [...] rem publicam defendant operamque dent (or videant) ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat", having destilled <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of sources writing about the decree. He therefore argues that senatus consultum de re publica defenda or [...] "quasi-dictatorship" [...] would be more fitting terms. It is the vague nature of the phrase that left the decree open for attacks over its legality. The word ultimum (final) does not indicate {{it to be the}} last decree passed by a senate or that it constituted an ultimatum, but rather that the decree was viewed (and for the most time used) only as a [...] "last resort".|$|E

[...] Nor, unlike some of his present-day admirers, did he play the ignoble, perverse, and stupid game of Holocaust denial....

2500|$|Untypical {{examples}} {{with specific}} activities include the famous Caravaggio, where Joseph holds the sheet music for an angel playing a viol; here both the Virgin and Child have fallen asleep. [...] The only piece of detail the gospel gives {{is that the}} flight began [...] "at night", but landscape scenes at night were very rare in art in the first centuries of the subject. [...] In a night scene by Rembrandt (1647, Dublin), the family seem to have joined some herdsmen with a big fire for the night; this is his only night landscape. [...] This relates to the painting of the Flight by Adam Elsheimer where they are just arriving at such an improvised encampment; Rembrandt would have known <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> print. [...] Two other unusual treatments from Dutch Golden Age painting are a realist scene showing the family in more or less contemporary dress in a run-down Dutch tavern or farmhouse by Abraham Bloemaert (1634, Rijksmuseum), and one with Joseph reading from a large book, no doubt religious, by Aert de Gelder (c. 1690, Boston).|$|E
2500|$|This {{positive}} experience {{has resulted in}} more generous alumni. [...] To this day, certain Greek alumni continue to contribute monetarily {{on a scale that}} dwarfs non-members: In the 1980s run-up to funding the Carlson School of Business, former Greek Curt Carlson discovered that he and fellow Greeks were responsible for what he estimated to be 67% of all donations received by the UM Foundation - <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> community whose undergraduate population had at the time been 3% of the school's population.

[...] CSHI was incorporated by several chapters to improve Greek Housing. While CSHI's proposed Greek Village development for the 1700 block of University Avenue was not adopted in 2011, in March 2012, University President Kaler followed up on his promise at that time with formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF), with the Charge to the group that [...] "emphasized the need to develop a sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.” He stated, [...] " [...] get better grades, graduate sooner, and give more money to the University." [...] Under his direction, the UM Foundation has been collecting data on Greek participation for all students, a data point that had been only sporadically kept prior to 2012.|$|E
