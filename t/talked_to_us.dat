500|$|An inquest into Shaw's death {{commenced}} in Exeter {{shortly after}} her death was reported to the coroner. The inquest heard evidence in late 2009, among which was eyewitness testimony that the team manager, a teacher from Edgehill College, had met with the group the morning of Shaw's death. During the meeting, the group asked to end the training hike early, but they were instructed by the teacher to carry on. However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition. The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under-prepared for the conditions they faced. The group member whose bag Shaw had been attempting to throw across the stream told the coroner [...] "We were not told how to cross swollen rivers. We were told how to check how deep it was but we were never told how to cross them. Nobody ever <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about using ropes".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. President, {{my mother}} and sister {{traveled}} abroad this summer and, when they got back, they <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about how shocked {{they were at the}} intensity of aggravation that other countries had with how we handled the Iraq situation. Diplomacy is, obviously, something that we have to really work on. What is your plan to repair relations with other countries, given the current situation? ...|$|E
2500|$|Darrow {{entered the}} racially charged {{atmosphere}} as {{the lawyer for}} the defendants. Darrow reconstructed the case as a justified honor killing by Thomas Massie. Considered by The New York Times to be one of Darrow's three most compelling trials (along with the Scopes Trial and the Leopold and Loeb case), the case captivated the nation and most of white America strongly supported the honor killing defense. In fact, the final defense arguments were transmitted to the mainland through a special radio hookup. In the end, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict of guilty, but on the lesser crime of manslaughter. As to Darrow's closing, one juror commented, [...] "e <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> like a bunch of farmers. That stuff may go over big in the Middle West, but not here." [...] Governor Lawrence Judd later commuted the sentences to one hour in his office. Years later Deacon admitted to shooting Kahahawai; Massie was found [...] "not Guilty" [...] in a posthumous trial.|$|E

60|$|Even {{in actual}} life egotism {{is not without}} its attractions. When people <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about others they are usually dull. When they <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about {{themselves}} they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them up when they become wearisome as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied they would be perfect absolutely.|$|R

60|$|He was as charming as ever. He <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{with delight}} about the quaintness of London. He would be ravished to dine next evening with Sir Charles. He desired his respectful salutations {{meanwhile}} to Miladi Vandrift and Madame Ventvorth.|$|E

I won’t prove it, excuse me Skana, I won’t prove it, the whale will prove it. Let me tell you, as soon as I can get some liquid {{crystals}} in my hand, the whale will start <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in English. In words that we can see, like the I Ching…" ...|$|R

60|$|Jill and I {{had never}} seen Aunt Tommy before, but we took {{to her from the}} start because she was so pretty and because she <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> just as if we were grown up. She called Jill Elizabeth, and Jill would adore a Hottentot who called her Elizabeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you see I confess"--he {{went on with}} {{laborious}} distinctness--"I {{confess that}} {{all the people who}} called our duel mad were right in a way. I would confess it to old Cumberland Vane and his eye-glass. I would confess it even to that old ass in brown flannel who <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about Love. Yes, they are right in a way. I am a little mad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't {{remember}} me, Mr. Clemens, but I {{remember you}} very well. I was a cadet at West Point {{when you and}} Rev. Joseph H. Twichell came there some years ago and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> on a Hundredth Night. I am a lieutenant in the regular army now, and my name is H. I am in Europe, all alone, for a modest little tour; my regiment is in Arizona." ...|$|E

60|$|Hollis looked smiling {{into the}} box. He had lately made a dash home through the Canal. He {{had been away}} six months, and only joined us again {{just in time for}} this last trip. We had never seen the box before. His hands hovered above it; and he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> ironically, but his face became as grave as though he were pronouncing a {{powerful}} incantation over the things inside.|$|E
6000|$|Next day {{and next}} night, Mr. Macloghlen was our devoted slave. I had won his heart by admitting frankly that his countrywomen had the finest and liveliest eyes in Europe--eyes {{with a deep}} twinkle, half fun, half passion. He took to us at once, and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> incessantly. He was a red-haired, raw-boned Munster-man, but a real good fellow. We forgot the {{aggressive}} inequalities of the Mediterranean while he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> of 'the pizzantry.' Late the second evening he propounded a confidence. It was a lovely night; Orion overhead, and the plashing phosphorescence on the water below conspired with the hour to make him specially confidential. 'Now, Miss Cayley,' he said, leaning forward on his deck chair, and gazing earnestly into my eyes, 'there's wan question I'd like to ask ye. The ambition of me life is to get into Parlimint. And I want to know from ye, as a frind--if I accomplish me heart's wish--is there annything, in me apparence, ar in me voice, ar in me accent, ar in me manner, that would lade annybody to suppose I was an Oirishman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The king {{then stood}} up and spoke. 'Much hast thou <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> this morning, and greatly hast thou {{wondered}} that thou canst not see our God; but we expect that he will soon come to us. Thou wouldst frighten us with thy God, who is both blind and deaf, and cannot even move about without being carried; but now I expect it will be but a short time before he meets his fate: for turn your eyes towards the east,--behold our God advancing in great light.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Grant stood forward. [...] "We'll {{give you}} {{half a minute}} to send {{somebody}} out <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and then we're coming in," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Helen, dear, {{afterwards}} we {{will get}} Mr. Lessingham <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about Dick," [...] she insisted. [...] "First there are some questions which I must ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, to {{the seat}} of l'arning--the 'City of Light' you used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about as a little boy! Is it all you {{expected}} of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And we had {{sat through}} it, which is something. The alpaca blue-bottles buzzed over {{the masses of}} food that went back on the dishes to the tin altar. Surely it had been made {{deliberately}} so {{that we should not}} eat it! The Cagliarese young woman <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Yes, she broke into that awful language which the Italians--the quite ordinary ones--call French, and which they insist on speaking for their own glorification: yea, when they get to heaven's gate they will ask St. Peter for: ...|$|E
6000|$|THE MAIDEN. My poor Strephon: I pretended I {{was only}} two for your sake. I was two when you were born. I saw you break from your shell; and you were such a charming child! You ran round and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all so prettily, and were so {{handsome}} and well grown, that I lost my heart to you at once. But now I {{seem to have lost}} it altogether: bigger things are taking possession of me. Still, we were very happy in our childish way for the first year, werent we? ...|$|E
6000|$|BARNABAS. If I {{have to die}} when I am seventy-eight, I don't see why {{another man}} should be privileged to live to be two hundred and seventy-eight. It does shorten my life, relatively. It makes us ridiculous. If they grew to be twelve feet high they would make us all dwarfs. They <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{as if we were}} children. There is no love lost between us: their hatred of us came out soon enough. You heard what the woman said, and how the Archbishop backed her up? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{come and}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> Prince," [...] she begged. [...] "I am {{so tired of}} this stupid game, and I am sure Captain Wilmot is bored to tears." ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor {{gave us the}} keys, and we rifled {{the desk}} and the drawers, sorting out all the papers. The doctor sat sipping and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your news {{does not}} {{surprise}} me, Harry. I {{have had a}} feeling all along that you knew something, but were keeping it from me. You spoke so very seldom of them, and when you did {{it seemed to me}} that what you said was not spoken in your natural voice. I felt sure that had you known nothing you would have often <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> of meeting them in London, and of the happiness it would be. I would not ask, because I was sure you had a good reason for not telling us; but I was quite sure that there was something." ...|$|E
60|$|The man {{in front}} of me was clearly no better informed, and then I {{gathered}} from a slightly contemptuous Scotchman beside me that it was Chris Robinson had walked between the honourable member in possession {{of the house and the}} Speaker. I caught a glimpse of him blushingly whispering about his misadventure to a colleague. He was just that same little figure I had once assisted to entertain at Cambridge, but grey-haired now, and still it seemed with the same knitted muffler he had discarded for a reckless half-hour while he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in Hatherleigh's rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure," [...] said Humming-Bird, [...] "that {{taking care}} of my clothes and going into company is, frankly, all I do. If I go to parties, as other girls do, and make calls, and keep dressed,--you know papa is not rich, and one must do these things economically,--it really does take all the time I have. When I was {{confirmed}} the Bishop <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> so sweetly, and I really meant sincerely to be a good girl,--to be as good as I knew how; but now, when they talk about fighting the good fight and running the Christian race, I feel very mean and little, for I am quite sure this isn't doing it. But what is,--and who is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must not}} be one, dear Nell,' cried the boy. 'We can't see them. They never come <b>to</b> play with <b>us,</b> or <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Be what you are. You are better so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A nurse {{came out}} of her Ladyship's room with her; and while my Lady was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> walked {{up and down in the}} next room with {{something}} in her arms.|$|R
