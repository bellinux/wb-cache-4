5|$|The {{following}} day, as Australia faced a large deficit on {{the first}} innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in support of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. In {{the course of the}} innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but lost sight of the ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and fell <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> play stopped as Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field. The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued. Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor man}} falls <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> asks {{that as an}} act of mercy to be {{executed}} instead as he feels it is better for him to die than to lose the eyesight. The Khan is adamant and the servants take Ali away to blind him.|$|E
25|$|Hughes was {{a notorious}} {{consumer}} {{of alcohol and}} food. Towards {{the end of his}} career, this was felt to have increased damage <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> may have ultimately led to a shortening of his Australian and Victorian playing careers. Having always been rather overweight, he participated in both seasons of Channel Nine's Celebrity Overhaul to lose weight and improve his fitness. He was the top performer (weight-wise) in the first season of the show.|$|E
50|$|Redding {{was placed}} on season-ending injured reserve with {{injuries}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> groin on December 12, 2008.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010-11 season, he {{was plagued}} by {{injuries}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> missed many matches with Hangzhou Greentown {{as well as the}} Hong Kong national football team.|$|R
50|$|Due <b>to</b> {{injuries}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> foot, Soto was on {{the disabled}} list {{for the first half of}} the 2014 season. On July 9, 2014, Soto was arrested on a charge of cocaine possession.|$|R
25|$|On June 9, 1962, Geiger crashed {{directly}} into the center field wall at Fenway Park attempting to catch a Tito Francona drive as the Red Sox lost to his old team Cleveland in 13 innings. He ventured back on the dirt track and {{looked as if he}} were {{going to come up with}} the ball. He made a sudden leap for it but struck the wall, and the ball caromed back onto the field. He landed on his feet, clapped his head with his arm, sank slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> fell flat on the ground. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin mourns and wavers in his {{commitment}} to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired personally. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a decisive battle at the Battle of Cowpens. The British appear to {{have the upper hand}} until Benjamin rallies the troops forward against their lines and Tavington rushes to personally target him. The two duel and Tavington gains the upper hand, delivering several wounds to Benjamin. A beaten Benjamin slumps <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> Tavington prepares to deliver the coup de grâce. At the last second, however, Benjamin dodges the attack and stabs Tavington to death, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory and Cornwallis is forced to retreat.|$|E
25|$|As Rick sits in silence, Negan drives {{back to the}} {{clearing}} and hauls Rick from the RV. Reunited with both groups, Negan explains to Rick that he hopes that the trip changed Rick's mind about him. Since Rick still refuses to submit to him, Negan forces Rick <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> has his son, Carl (Chandler Riggs), kneel next to him. Negan tells Rick {{that if he does}} not cut off his son's arm, he will kill every member of Rick's group and those back in Alexandria. Ricks pleads to have Negan take his life instead, but Negan refuses. Sobbing, Rick picks up the axe and is about to cut Carl when Negan stops him, happy that he has finally submitted. Negan then tells Rick and the others that they will come to Alexandria in one week to take one half of their supplies. After seizing Daryl as a hostage, Negan and the Saviors leave the group in despair.|$|E
5000|$|Young {{eventually}} came back, as did Rice for [...] quarters (before getting another unrelated injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee),</b> <b>and</b> the team, with the league's number one defense leading the way, pulled together and finished strongly at 13-3.|$|R

25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
25|$|Sakuraba {{was then}} {{scheduled}} {{to compete in}} Hero's Light Heavyweight Tournament. His first opponent was the 16–5 Lithuanian Kęstutis Smirnovas. Sakuraba opened the fight striking aggressively, even flooring Smirnovas with a kick, but as he was coming in to follow up he was caught and knocked down <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> hands. Kazushi then turned over, sliding beneath the bottom rope, and Smirnovas unleashed repeated blows to his head. As Sakuraba seemed at this point unable to defend himself, when the referee stepped between the two fighters it seemed likely he was moving {{to put an end}} to the contest. However, instead of halting the battle, the referee re-positioned the fighters from underneath the bottom rope into the ring and resumed the bout. Though the restarting of fighters who have found themselves near or outside the ropes is common practice, it was nonetheless controversial. Following the restart, Smirnovas picked up where he'd left off and proceed to pound a turtled Sakuraba, but the Japanese managed to escape to his feet and land a sharp combination, staggering Smirnovas and bloodying his face. Having turned the tide of the match, Sakuraba began dominating the Lithuanian on the striking segments until Smirnovas dropped to the ground to escape the assault. Sakuraba then accomplished an armbar, focing his opponent to give up.|$|E
50|$|During his imprisonment, Donaghy was {{attacked}} and threatened. In November 2007, a man {{claiming to be}} an associate of the New York Mafia struck Donaghy with a paint roller extension bar, resulting in injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> leg which required surgery.|$|R
50|$|Albrecht {{retired from}} {{professional}} wrestling in 1999 {{as a result}} of injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> shoulder sustained in the bout with Vega in 1998.

60|$|He was a pitiful, half-tragic, and half-grotesque {{figure as}} he stood with one trouser leg rolled <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> that ever-present horror still lurking in his eyes. A burst of merriment came from the card-players {{in the next room}} and the two looked at each other in silence.|$|R
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Stone, distinguished himself while serving as squad leader of the 1st Platoon. The 1st Platoon was on a combat patrol mission just west of Landing Zone Liz when it came under intense automatic weapons and grenade fire from a well concealed company-size force of North Vietnamese regulars. Observing the platoon machinegunner fall critically wounded, Sgt. Stone remained in the exposed area to provide cover fire for the wounded soldier who was being pulled to safety by another member of the platoon. With enemy fire impacting all around him, Sgt. Stone had a malfunction in the machinegun, preventing him from firing the weapon automatically. Displaying extraordinary courage under the most adverse conditions, Sgt. Stone repaired the weapon and continued to place on the enemy positions effective suppressive fire which enabled the rescue to be completed. In a desperate attempt to overrun his position, an enemy force left its cover and charged Sgt. Stone. Disregarding the danger involved, Sgt. Stone rose <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> began placing intense fire on the enemy at pointblank range, killing 6 of the enemy before falling mortally wounded. His actions of unsurpassed valor were a source of inspiration to his entire unit, and he was responsible for saving the lives of a number of his fellow soldiers. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military profession and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|E
500|$|The {{butterfly}} style - used by most {{all modern}} goaltenders - {{was invented by}} Glenn Hall. [...] Considered both unique and foolish, Hall's style of dropping <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> kicking his pads out in a V formation forced shooters to aim for {{the top half of}} the net. Hall adopted the technique as a youth when he lacked the arm strength to stop shots with his stick. An eight-time All-Star, Hall became an NHL regular at the start of the 1955–1956 season to begin a sequence of 502 consecutive games as goaltender for Detroit and Chicago. This record is hailed as one of the NHL's most unbreakable.|$|E
500|$|The first bout on the {{pay-per-view}} {{portion of}} the event saw Mike Easton taking on Ivan Menjivar in a bantamweight contest. The entire fight remained on the feet, with both fighter throwing 317 combined strikes. All three judges scored the bout in favor of Easton, with two scoring it 30–27 while one judge seeing it 29–28 giving Easton the unanimous decision victory. The second bout saw former title contender Chad Mendes fighting [...] contestant Cody McKenzie. Early in the first round, Mendes caught his opponent with a straight right hand to the midsection. McKenzie collapsed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> Mendes attacked him with ground-and-pound, forcing the referee to stop the contest at thirty-one seconds. It was the first knockout victory for Mendes since 2009.|$|E

25|$|Injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> later <b>his</b> arm, {{drastically}} limited Fidrych's {{appearances in}} 1977–78, as the Tigers returned to doormat status. Perhaps more important, however, was the talent coming {{up through the}} Tigers farm system at the time. Key players like Jack Morris, Dan Petry, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Kirk Gibson and Lance Parrish all made their debuts in the late 1970s.|$|R
500|$|Irpa {{appears in}} chapter 21 of the Jómsvíkinga saga, {{which focuses on}} the late 10th century Battle of Hjörungavágr between the fleet of [...] the Jomsvikings under Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson and the fleet of Haakon Sigurdsson and Sweyn Haakonsson. Haakon calls a meeting during a lull in the fighting, and says that he feels that the tide of the battle is going against his allies and him. Haakon then goes to an island called Primsigned, north of Hjórunga Bay. On the island, Haakon falls <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and,</b> while looking northward, prays to what is {{described}} as his patron goddess, Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr. According to the saga, Þorgerðr repeatedly refuses his offers, but finally accepts the blót of his 7-year-old son. Haakon's slave, Skopti, slaughters the boy.|$|E
500|$|According to Beauchamp's account, {{he found}} Sharp and {{challenged}} {{him to a}} duel, but Sharp refused {{because he was not}} armed. Wielding a knife, Beauchamp took out a second knife and offered it to Sharp, who again declined the challenge. When Beauchamp challenged him a third time, Sharp tried to flee, but Beauchamp caught him by the collar. [...] Sharp fell <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> begged Beauchamp to spare his life. Beauchamp kicked him, cursed him for a coward, and threatened to horsewhip him until he agreed to a duel. The next day, Beauchamp looked for Sharp in the streets of Frankfort, but was told he had left for Bowling Green. He went to Bowling Green, only to learn that Sharp was not there. Finally he returned to the home of Anna Cooke.|$|E

2500|$|Chang {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} cramps, but managed to take a 5–3 lead in the fifth set with two match points on Lendl's serve. Aiming to break Lendl's concentration one more time, Chang stood almost at the T-line in {{the centre of the}} court while waiting to receive Lendl's serve. The crowd started laughing at the bizarre situation and Lendl seemed to think everyone was mocking him. The tactic worked, as Lendl produced a double-fault to give Chang the victory, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3, 6–3, in 4 hours and 37 minutes. Chang sank <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> broke down in tears {{at the conclusion of the}} match.|$|E
