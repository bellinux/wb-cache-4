5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> Copenhagen. However, as the years went by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E

25|$|Paris, a Trojan prince, came to Sparta {{to claim}} Helen, {{in the guise}} of a {{supposed}} diplomatic mission. Before this journey, Paris had been appointed by Zeus to judge the most beautiful goddess; Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite. In order to earn his favour, Aphrodite promised Paris <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the world. Swayed by Aphrodite's offer, Paris chose her as the most beautiful of the goddesses, earning the wrath of Athena and Hera.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> {{the world}} was Helen, one of the daughters of Tyndareus, King of Sparta. Her mother was Leda, who had been either raped or seduced by Zeus {{in the form of}} a swan. Accounts differ over which of Leda's four children, two pairs of twins, were fathered by Zeus and which by Tyndareus. However, Helen is usually {{credited}} as Zeus' daughter, and sometimes Nemesis is credited as her mother. Helen had scores of suitors, and her father was unwilling to choose one for fear the others would retaliate violently.|$|E

Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the world, Helen of Sparta.

25|$|All of {{the gods}} were invited to Peleus and Thetis' wedding and brought many gifts, except Eris (the goddess of discord), who was stopped at the door by Hermes, on Zeus' order. Insulted, she threw from the door a gift of her own: a golden apple (το μήλον της έριδος) on which was inscribed the word καλλίστῃ Kallistēi ("To the fairest"). The apple was claimed by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. They quarreled bitterly over it, {{and none of the}} other gods would venture an opinion favoring one, for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. Eventually, Zeus ordered Hermes to lead the three goddesses to Paris, a prince of Troy, who, unaware of his ancestry, was being raised as a {{shepherd}} in Mount Ida, because of a prophecy that he would be the downfall of Troy. After bathing in the spring of Ida, the goddesses appeared to him naked, either for the sake of winning or at Paris' request. Paris was unable to decide between them, so the goddesses resorted to bribes. Athena offered Paris wisdom, skill in battle, and the abilities of the greatest warriors; Hera offered him political power and control of all of Asia; and Aphrodite offered him the love of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the world, Helen of Sparta. Paris awarded the apple to Aphrodite, and, after several adventures, returned to Troy, where he was recognized by his royal family.|$|E

Ahalya is often described to be created by the god Brahma as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the entire universe, but also sometimes as an earthy princess of Lunar Dynasty. Ahalya was placed in the care of Gautama, until she gained puberty and was finally married to the elderly sage.|$|E

500|$|The Greek {{goddess of}} discord, Eris, became disgruntled {{after she was}} {{excluded}} from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.

Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient.

500|$|Ahalya {{is often}} {{described}} as an ayonijasambhava, one not born of a woman. The Bala Kanda of the Ramayana (5th to 4th century BCE) mentions that Brahma moulds her [...] "with great effort out of pure creative energy". The Brahma Purana (401–1300 CE) and the Vishnudharmottara Purana (401–500 CE) also record her creation by Brahma. According to the Mahari dance tradition, Brahma created Ahalya out of water as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> order to break the pride of Urvashi, the foremost celestial nymph. The tribal Bhil Ramayana begins with the tale of Ahalya, Gautama and Indra. In the tale, Ahalya is created from the ashes of the sacrificial fire by the Saptarishi (seven seers) and gifted to Gautama. In contrast, the Bhagavata Purana (501–1000 CE) and the Harivamsa (1–300 CE) regard Ahalya as a princess of the Puru Dynasty, the daughter of King Mudgala and sister of King Divodasa.|$|E
500|$|The 1937–1938 film tie-in serial {{comic strip}} [...] "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" [...] written by Merrill De Maris, {{one of the}} writers of the film, is centred {{primarily}} around the relationship between Snow White and the Queen. It further explores {{the source of the}} Queen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to her castle seeking <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> all the world and is shocked when he says he meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the Queen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch form, she later tells the captive Prince that she is {{going to get rid of}} Snow White and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a [...] "miserable hag". This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much less dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept. The film was also adapted into an other comics including in 1969, 1983, and 1991.|$|E

The reference is also related to the city's earlier colonial history.

2500|$|In Greek mythology, Helen of Troy (Greek [...] Helénē, [...] ), {{also known}} as Helen of Sparta, or simply Helen, was the {{daughter}} of Zeus and Leda, and was a sister of Clytemnestra, Castor and Pollux. In Greek myths, she was considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the world. By marriage she was Queen of Laconia, a province within Homeric Greece, the wife of King Menelaus. Her elopement with Prince Paris of Troy brought about the Trojan War. She was described by Dares Phrygius as [...] "She was beautiful, ingenuous, and charming. Her legs were the best; her mouth the cutest. There was a beauty-mark between her eyebrows".|$|E

2500|$|Welch's most {{controversial}} role came in Myra Breckinridge (1970). She took the {{role as the}} film's transsexual heroine {{in an attempt to}} be taken seriously as an actress, but the movie was a failure. The production was characterized by constant animosity between Welch and Mae West, who walked out of the film for three days. The film was based on Gore Vidal's controversial bestseller about a man who becomes a woman through surgery. The film's producer Robert Fryer stated: [...] "If a man were going to become a woman, he would want to become <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the world.

2500|$|The Sublime, moreover, {{does not}} {{manifest}} itself only {{in what is}} simply beautiful, but also in what is sufficiently distressing to cause bewilderment ( [...] , ekplēxis), wonder ( [...] , to thaumaston) and even fear ( [...] , phobos). It could be said that Helen of Troy may certainly have been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the world, but she was never sublime in Greek literature: however Edmund Burke cites {{the scene of the}} old men looking at Helen's [...] "terrible" [...] beauty on the ramparts of Troy—he regards it as an instance of the beautiful, but his imagination is captured by its sublimity. Hecuba in Euripides's The Trojan Women is certainly sublime when she expresses her endless sorrow for the terrible destiny of her children.|$|E
