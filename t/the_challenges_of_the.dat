5|$|After being {{promoted}} to colonel, {{he served as}} Director of Military Intelligence between 1960 and 1964, and while the Australian Army was developing its own doctrine on counter-revolutionary warfare, Graham's ideas on counter-insurgency were influenced by a visit to South Vietnam in November 1961. Graham's understanding of <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing Cold War environment allowed him to reform Australia's nascent military intelligence apparatus, encouraging developments in joint intelligence arrangements with Australia's allies and fostering liaison with his British and US counterparts, as well as establishing relationships with countries in South-East Asia. In recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1963. He then took up an appointment as commandant of the Jungle Training Centre (JTC) at Canungra, Queensland in 1964. The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) was being prepared for deployment during this time, and Army officers were learning new tactics, techniques and procedures. Promoted to brigadier in 1965 he then commanded the 6th Task Force in southern Queensland, supervising the training of 2 RAR and 6 RAR, both battalions which would later serve under his command in Vietnam. In 1966, Graham studied at the Imperial Defence College in London.|$|E

Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade.|$|E

25|$|Carrión presided and led {{the bank}} until 1956. Under his {{leadership}} the bank established its first physical branch in 1934. In its first year the bank provided personal loans without requiring collateral. This made the bank enormously popular (in accordance with its name) and, by 1954, the bank had 20 branches {{in different parts of}} the island. This represented a growth rate of one new Banco Popular branch for every year of its existence, between 1934 and 1954. Given <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean War, this success and growth rate was astounding.|$|E

This latter source of funding has greatly compensated {{for the lack of}} sufficient government funding for universities up until now but it is expected to diminish significantly in the years to come.
