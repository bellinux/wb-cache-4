5|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of UST, the Faculty of Pharmacy opened its doors to women in the {{academic}} year 1924–1925. It was one of the first universities in the Philippines to become co-educational when it admitted women. There were 24 women enrollees out of the 93 who matriculated for the said Faculty that school year. The University, however, had been granting certificates through the School of Midwifery since 1879.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} used {{a comparative}} analysis approach to determine mentoring 2 ̆ 7 s ability <b>to</b> socialize law <b>faculty.</b> Specifically, {{it sought to}} examine the efficacy of formal and informal mentoring in socializing law <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> their respective institutions. A Mentoring Questionnaire was developed to determine the occurrence of mentoring, the distinctions between {{the various forms of}} mentoring, and law faculty perceptions of the effectiveness of the various forms of mentoring received. The Organizational Socialization Questionnaire measured socialization along six dimensions of People, Performance Proficiency, Politics, Language, History and Organizational Goals and Values and was used to determine socialization differences among mentored and non-mentored faculty and tenured and non-tenured faculty. Socialization differences were examined by comparing mentored <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> non-mentored <b>faculty,</b> formally mentored <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> informally mentored <b>faculty,</b> tenured <b>faculty</b> <b>to,</b> non-tenured <b>faculty,</b> male <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> female <b>faculty</b> and majority <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> minority <b>faculty.</b> Results of this dissertation indicate there are differences between mentored and non-mentored faculty. Differences were also found between senior level non-mentored and junior level mentored faculty. These differences are discussed along with their implications and conclusions are drawn. The dissertation ends with recommendations for future research...|$|R
