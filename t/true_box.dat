An advertising campaign on billboards and in British national newspapers such as the Sunday Express was run in the 1960s and 1970s by one prominent group of Southcottians, the Panacea Society in Bedford (formed 1920), {{to try to persuade}} the twenty-four bishops to have the box opened. Their slogan was: [...] "War, disease, crime and banditry, distress of nations and perplexity will increase until the Bishops open Joanna Southcott's box." [...] According to the Panacea Society, this <b>true</b> <b>box</b> is in their possession at a secret location for safekeeping, with its whereabouts only be disclosed only when a meeting with the bishops has been arranged. Southcott prophesied that the Day of Judgement would come in the year 2004, and her followers stated that if the contents of the box had not been studied beforehand, the world would have had to meet it unprepared.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{accepting}} a parcel from another person, {{we are able}} to use information about that person’s movement to estimate in advance the weight of the parcel, that is, to judge its weight from observed action. Perceptual weight judgment provides a powerful method to study our interpretation of other people’s actions, but it is not known what sources of informa-tion are used in judging weight. We have manipulated full form videos to obtain precise control of the per-ceived kinematics of a box lifting action, and use this technique to explore the kinematic cues that affect weight judgment. We find that observers rely most on the duration of the lifting movement to judge weight, and make less use of the durations of the grasp phase, when the box is first gripped, or the place phase, when the box is put down. These findings can be compared to the kinematics of natural box lifting behaviour, where we find that the duration of the grasp compo-nent is the best predictor of <b>true</b> <b>box</b> weight. The lack of accord between the optimal cues predicted by the natural behaviour and the cues actually used in the perceptual task has implications for our understanding of action observation in terms of a motor simulation. The differences between perceptual and motor behav-iour are evidence against a strong version of the motor simulation hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} <b>true</b> triaxial <b>box</b> with individually {{applied stress}} system {{is used to}} model the in-situ cross-hole and down-hole seismic tests, and hence determine the small-strain shear modulus and damping ratio, i. e.

The spectral ratio method integrated with the self-healing technique gives similar damping ratios as in resonant column tests under isotropic confinement. Experimental results provide further evidence that shear modulus is only dependent on the principle stresses in the direction of shear wave propagation and polarization. The damping ratio, however, is independent of the principle stress changes, regardless of its direction with respect to the polarization plane.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transcriptional promoter contains a single polymorphism in the TATA box. Most subtypes contain the sequence TATAAGC, but subtype E and some recombinant AG strains have the sequence TA (A) under bar AAGC. Based on mutagenesis studies of cellular RNA polymerase II (pol II) promoters, it has been proposed that the subtype E TATA box is nonfunctional due to the T-to-A substitution at the critical position 3. By means of transcription and virus replication assays, we demonstrate that the <b>true</b> TATA <b>box</b> motif within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter starts two nucleotides further upstream. Because of this realignment, subtype E has the sequence (CA) under bar TA (A) under bar AA and all other subtypes have the sequence (CA) under bar TATAA. The polymorphism therefore has shifted from position 3 to position 5 {{and is no longer}} incompatible with efficient transcription according to rules determined for cellular pol II promoters. In addition, through sensitive competition experiments, we demonstrate that the CATA box of subtypes B and E can be improved for replication by the mutations 1 T and 5 T, respectively. The fact that the fitness of both subtype LTRs can be increased by specific point mutations in the CATA box suggests that the transcriptional promoter of HIV- 1 is fine-tuned towards a suboptimal level of replication. However, this replication rate may be optimal in the in vivo context of an infected individua...|$|R

40|$|Question: Which {{treatments}} are effective for treating jellyfish stings from species in North America and Hawaii? Review scope: Included studies compared interventions for pain relief, prevention of nematocyst discharge, or extrusion of venom from <b>true</b> jellyfish (Cnidaria), <b>box</b> jellyfish, or Physalia species found in North American and Hawaiian waters. Outcomes were pain or erythema from envenomation, discharge of nematocysts, and extrusion of venom. Review methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE Excerpta Medica, CINAHL, Cochrane Reviews, Google Scholar, reviews, and reference lists were searched for English-language studies. 19 studies met inclusion criteria; 6 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 390), all measuring pain outcomes, and {{are reported in}} this abstract. 2 RCTs had inadequate randomization, 2 had inadequate blinding, and 2 had low follow-up. No RCTs measured discharge of nematocysts or extrusion of venom, and none studied stings from Chiropsalmus quadrumanus or Chrysaora quinquecirrha.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The dual {{specificity}} phosphatase cdc 25 C was {{the first}} human cdc 25 family member found to be essential in the activation of cdk 1 /cyclin B 1 that {{takes place at the}} entry into mitosis. Human cdc 25 C is phosphorylated on Proline-dependent SP and TP sites when it becomes active at mitosis and the prevalent model is that this phosphorylation/activation of cdc 25 C would be part of an amplification loop with cdk 1 /cyclin B 1. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using highly specific antibodies directed against cdc 25 C phospho-epitopes, pT 67 and pT 130, we show here that these two phospho-forms of cdc 25 C represent distinct pools with differential localization during human mitosis. Phosphorylation on T 67 occurs from prophase and the cdc 25 C-pT 67 phospho-isoform closely localizes with condensed chromosomes throughout mitosis. The phospho-T 130 form of cdc 25 C arises in late G 2 and associates predominantly with centrosomes from prophase to anaphase B where it colocalizes with Plk 1. As shown by immunoprecipitation of each isoform, these two phospho-forms are not simultaneously phosphorylated on the other mitotic TP sites or associated with one another. Phospho-T 67 cdc 25 C co-precipitates with MPM 2 -reactive proteins while pT 130 -cdc 25 C is associated with Plk 1. Interaction and colocalization of phosphoT 130 -cdc 25 C with Plk 1 demonstrate in living cells, that the sequence around pT 130 acts as a <b>true</b> Polo <b>Box</b> Domain (PBD) binding site as previously identified from in vitro peptide screening studies. Overexpression of non-phosphorylatable alanine mutant forms for each isoform, but not wild type cdc 25 C, strongly impairs mitotic progression showing the functional requirement for each site-specific phosphorylation of cdc 25 C at mitosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results show {{for the first time that}} in human mitosis, distinct phospho-isoforms of cdc 25 C exist with different localizations and interacting partners, thus implying that the long-standing model of a cdc 25 C/cdk 1 multi-site auto amplification loop is implausible...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates dynamic {{property}} {{changes in}} aged sands and offers {{explanations for the}} measured results based {{on the concept of}} contact-force homogenization, as well as whether aging behavior is isotropic in nature. Resonant column tests of aged sands under various aging conditions were conducted. The results show that loose sands exhibit greater aging effects than dense sands do at a confining pressure of 35 kPa and the effects are completely opposite when the aging pressure is increased to 100 kPa. The aging effects can be partially erased by unloading-reloading; the remaining effects can be restored when the pressure {{is the same as the}} original pressure and the effects cannot be erased by additional unloading-reloading cycles. The stress history is also a factor that affects aging behavior: unloading-reloading and overconsolidation can reduce the aging rate in terms of the shear-modulus increase. The aging effects, however, can be wiped out by large strain shearing. An addition of fines (kaolinite) can increase the aging rate of the sand samples because of higher creep made by the softer kaolinite. The results of resonant column tests on Ottawa sand samples reveal that the medium-dense sample had the highest aging rate as determined by its shear-modulus increase followed by the dense and loose samples. This result is attributed to two competing processes, the tendency toward force-chain homogenization and the susceptibility to local structure collapse. This attribution does not apply to Toyoura sand samples, which suggests that the effect of packing density on the aging behavior of sand indeed varies with the type of sand. This deviation could be a result of the difference in grain size distribution and particle shape of the two types of sand tested. A hypothesis of the influence zone of particle creeping is proposed as well to explain the larger aging gain in shear modulus in dense samples. Bender element tests in the <b>true</b> triaxial <b>box</b> demonstrate that aging behavior is not isotropic by nature because the increase of shear wave velocities in different polarization planes varies under isotropic stress states. Increasing the stress in one direction leads to more significant increases in the velocities that are either polarized or propagating in that direction...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B {{virus is}} a hepatotropic virus. Its {{replication}} and gene expression are mainly restricted to hepatocytes in the infective process. The viral gene expression thus provides a unique system {{with which to}} study the control of tissue-specific gene expression. We have previously reported the identification and characterization of the second enhancer (enhancer II) of hepatitis B virus. In this report, we further demonstrate that the minimal functional constituents of the second enhancer, box a and box 13, display liver cell and differentiation state specificity. Moreover, box a exhibits the same liver cell and differentiation state specificity when functioning as an upstream regulator for the basal core promoter. Gel shift experiments reveal a unique box a-binding protein, protein a, which is present only in differentiated liver cells, where enhancer II is functional. The converse is <b>true</b> for another <b>box</b> a-binding protein, protein f, which is present only in poorly differentiated liver cells and nonliver cells. The simplest hypothesis that explains these results is that protein a activates and/or protein f suppresses the enhancer and upstream regulator functions. Although C/EBP {{is a candidate for}} a transcription factor that interacts with box a or box 13, none of the binding factors identified in the gel shift assays, including protein a and protein f, is likely to be C/EBP because they differ from C/EBP in heat lability and sequence preference.
