5|$|It was {{customary}} {{when proposing}} a disputation {{to have the}} theses printed by the university press and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the Ninety-five Theses have survived, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as Luther was not famous {{and the importance of}} the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the Theses, only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the Theses on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the Theses to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all. Regardless, the Theses were well-known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.|$|E

50|$|The {{legal concept}} was tried in Dubay v. Wells and <b>was</b> dismissed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> since {{legislation}} in the various jurisdictions currently sets forth guidelines for when child support is owed {{as well as its}} amount. Accordingly, legislation would be required to change the law to implement McCulley's concept.|$|R
30|$|The {{nature of}} participants’ {{comments}} related to factors {{began to change}} in session 4. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> because, as we discussed earlier, {{in the beginning of}} session 4, participants were introduced to the idea that cognitive demand can decline during the implementation of a high-level task. After this, participants began viewing the videos through this new lens.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the coup did not produce a major break with Tombalbaye's policies. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> because, like Tombalbaye, both Odingar and Malloum were Sara from the south of Chad. While the CSM did make some moves to conciliate {{the north of the}} country, the Muslims {{continued}} to feel themselves second-class citizens and the FROLINAT rebellion continued.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other insects, {{the wing}} {{muscles of the}} Ephemeroptera (Mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) insert {{directly}} at the wing bases, which are hinged so that a small movement of the wing base downward, lifts the wing itself upward, very much like rowing through the air. Dragonflies and damselflies have fore and hind wings similar in shape and size. Each operates independently, which gives a degree of fine control and mobility {{in terms of the}} abruptness with which they can change direction and speed, not seen in other flying insects. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> given that odonates are all aerial predators, and they have always hunted other airborne insects.|$|E
25|$|Conservatories {{were popular}} {{throughout}} California’s early history. Structures of various {{shapes and sizes}} were built in Victorian California, ranging from an attached and glassed-in wing for a residence, to a great domed or compartmentalized, detached glasshouse. Examples of wealthy Californians who built conservatories in their private estates include: A.K.P. (Albion Keith Paris) Harmon, for his Oakland Lake Merritt Estate (which later became Lakeside Park); Frederick Delger; Frank M. Smith; Darius Ogden Mills (Millbrae); and Luther Burbank, for his own experiments with plant germination (Santa Rosa). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> as agriculture was fast becoming {{an important part of}} the state’s economy and horticulture an important aspect of the gentleman’s education. In each of these cases, wood was substituted for metal as the framing members. This posed special challenges for the ongoing maintenance and repair of the greenhouses in the long term.|$|E
25|$|No women {{occupy the}} top {{leadership}} {{positions in the}} most profitable Iranian businesses either. Iran's three largest companies-National Iranian Oil Company (the second largest in the Muslim World), Iran Khodro, and National Petrochemical Company-also {{do not have any}} women in senior leadership positions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as the 2006 Iranian census showed that only 4% of women are in senior executive or management positions. Critics of Iran's radical shia theocratic government may attribute this evidence of limited female economic mobility as a critique of the government's ideology. However, in Turkey, which is a secular state governed by a moderate Islamic party, women comprised only 8% of managers in the labor force in 2007. Regardless of the official status of Islam or the ideology of the ruling party, there exists some evidence of a glass ceiling for women in the private sector.|$|E

25|$|The 2-cent Lincoln {{stamp of}} 1909 -- the first U.S. single stamp {{commemorative}} issue -- {{had the same}} dimensions as a definitive stamp. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> for it was, in effect, cloned from the 2-cent Washington definitive issue of the previous year. Using a photostat of that stamp as a template, the designer Claire Aubrey Huston inserted an image of Lincoln into the wreath-surrounded oval occupied by Washington, and then superimposed the date ribbons in wash, turning the composite over to the engravers. Lincoln had appeared {{on at least one}} denomination of every regular issue since 1866. When the definitive issues of 1908 featured only the portraits of Washington and Franklin, there was considerable public disappointment at Lincoln's exclusion. The 100th anniversary issue of his birth created an opportunity to mollify the situation. The engraving of Lincoln on this issue by Marcus Baldwin is modeled after a statue by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens.|$|E
25|$|The uniform {{distribution}} {{as might be}} expected does not obey Benford's law. In contrast, the ratio distribution of two {{uniform distribution}}s is well described by Benford's law. Benford's law also describes the exponential distribution and the ratio distribution of two exponential distributions well. Although the half-normal distribution does not obey Benford's law, the ratio distribution of two half-normal distributions does. Neither the right-truncated normal distribution nor the ratio distribution of two right-truncated normal distributions are well described by Benford's law. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as this distribution is weighted towards larger numbers. Neither the normal distribution nor the ratio distribution of two normal distributions (the Cauchy distribution) obey Benford's law. The fit of chi square distribution depends on the degrees of freedom (df) with good agreement with df = 1 and decreasing agreement as the df increases. The F distribution is fitted well for low degrees of freedom. With increasing dfs the fit decreases but much more slowly than the chi square distribution. The fit of the log-normal distribution depends on the mean and the variance of the distribution. The variance has a much greater effect on the fit than does the mean. Larger values of both parameters result in better agreement with the law. The ratio of two log normal distributions is a log normal so this distribution was not examined.|$|E
500|$|The first {{expedition}} {{to visit the}} ice stream was a United States over-snow traverse, where they spent around {{a week in the}} area of PIG during January 1961. They dug snow pits to measure snow accumulation and carried out seismic surveys to measure ice thickness. One of the scientists on this traverse was Charles R. Bentley, who claims [...] "we didn't know we were crossing a glacier at the time." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> because PIG is around [...] wide at the point visited and at ground level cannot be visually distinguished from the surrounding ice.

2500|$|Several {{correlations}} {{have been}} shown between infrared stretching frequencies of certain bonds and the electronegativities of the atoms involved: however, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as such stretching frequencies depend in part on bond strength, which enters into the calculation of Pauling electronegativities. More convincing are the correlations between electronegativity and chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy or isomer shifts in Mössbauer spectroscopy (see figure). Both these measurements depend on the s-electron density at the nucleus, and so are a good indication that the different measures of electronegativity really are describing [...] "the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself".|$|E

The Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum by Adam of Bremen mentions [...] "Sigafrid et Anulo, nepotes Godafridi", {{which would make}} both Anulo and Sigifrid [...] "nepotes" [...] (plural of nepos) of Gudfred. The Royal Frankish Annals then note [...] "Heriold and Reginfrid, kings of the Danes, send an embassy to the emperor , asking for peace and requesting that their brother Hemming be released."

Byass, and her trade as Liverpool-Africa, indicating a slave-trader. Byass received a letter of marque on 24 August 1805. A database on slave voyages from Liverpool lists Rolla, Byass, and Ratcliffe, but has no other information. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> because, as {{she was on her}} way to gather slaves in West Africa the French captured her.|$|E

[...] For instance, Christopher Partridge wrote of this association as [...] "easily transferred" [...] The connection does exist {{in the sense that}} there is a subset of persons interested in both esoteric writings and UFOs and who link them as shown by the fact that some books that cite Alice Bailey or Theosophy also cite UFOs.|$|E

His work, which pairs a coolly minimalist aesthetic with a retro nostalgia, centers around his tongue-in-cheek take on the journey for truth inside the lives of small town youth, especially athletic, all-American, young men. Many of the photographs are homoerotic, yet sexually ambivalent and never perverse. Images from his earlier collections were inspired by fitness manuals and yearbooks circa 1910. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> since Smalley graduated {{with a degree in}} sports medicine from Pepperdine University and worked {{for a number of years}} as a model and personal trainer.

2500|$|The PCA is {{generally}} less theologically conservative than the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC, founded in 1936), but {{more conservative than}} the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC, founded in 1981) and the Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO, founded in 2012), though the differences can vary from presbytery to presbytery and even congregation to congregation. [...] The PCA, as mentioned above, will not ordain women as teaching elders (pastors), ruling elders, or deacons, while the EPC considers this issue a [...] "non-essential" [...] matter left to the individual ordaining body, and ECO fully embraces women's ordination. However, there is an increasingly strong movement in the PCA to allow ordination of women as deacons including overtures in the General Assembly. [...] A number of PCA churches {{are known to have}} non-ordained women deacons and deaconesses. The EPC is also more tolerant of the charismatic movement than the PCA. However, there is a strong New Calvinist movement in the PCA that practices contemporary music, adheres to a continuationist position on the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and engages in civil dialogue with differing theological views. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> since PCA has issued, from its inception, a pastoral letter to all the PCA churches to tolerate the charismatics within its ranks.|$|E

Growth ceased, at both sites, earlier in the drier (based on both rainfall and evaporation) years. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> as other studies have shown that trees growing under drier conditions have been shown to cease growth earlier than trees in less xeric conditions (Gruber et al. 2010). Through the effect of water availability on tree water relations, these conditions can be expected to cause a reduction in cambial activity, tracheid expansion and general phenology and metabolism (Hinckley et al. 1979; Kramer et al. 2000; Drew et al. 2014).|$|R
