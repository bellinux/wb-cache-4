5|$|John Roberts <b>Tunis</b> {{was born}} December 7, 1889 to John Arthur and Caroline Greene Roberts <b>Tunis,</b> a teacher, in Boston, Massachusetts. John Arthur {{came from a}} well-to-do family, which he upset by leaving the Episcopalian church to become a Unitarian minister. His family disowned him when he married Caroline, the {{daughter}} of a waiter. When <b>Tunis</b> was seven and his brother Robert five their father died of Bright's disease; no one from the <b>Tunis</b> side of the family attended the funeral. After his death their mother taught at Brearley School for girls in Manhattan, later moving the family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she ran a boarding house.|$|E
5|$|Arafat and Fatah's {{center for}} {{operations}} {{was based in}} <b>Tunis,</b> the capital of Tunisia, until 1993. In 1985 Arafat narrowly survived an Israeli assassination attempt when Israeli Air Force F-15s bombed his <b>Tunis</b> headquarters as part of Operation Wooden Leg, leaving 73 people dead; Arafat had gone out jogging that morning.|$|E
5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke {{was born}} in <b>Tunis</b> in 1978. She is of Russian-Ukrainian and Tunisian heritage, her father a sports {{academic}} and her mother a chemist. Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kiev and <b>Tunis.</b> She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study modern dance. With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the <b>Tunis</b> Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows.|$|E
5|$|Tunis' {{maternal}} grandfather {{encouraged the}} brothers {{to take an}} interest in baseball. Two of young Tunis' heroes were Boston Nationals' baseball players Billy Hamilton and Fred Tenney. At age fourteen <b>Tunis</b> and his brother, too poor to pay the admission price, managed to watch a Davis Cup tennis match by climbing on top of a brewery wagon outside the courts. <b>Tunis</b> played tennis at Cambridge Latin School, then followed in his father's footsteps to Harvard where he competed in tennis and ran track. He graduated from Harvard with a B. A. in 1911, then got a job in a Newburyport, Massachusetts, cotton mill. <b>Tunis</b> became an officer in the U.S. Army, serving in France during World War I. On February 19, 1918, <b>Tunis</b> married Lucy Rogers in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They did not have any children.|$|E
5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of <b>Tunis</b> {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was most likely a simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of <b>Tunis,</b> on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at the proclamation of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the design}} and {{significance}} of maritime flags flying on ships in <b>Tunis</b> are unknown. However, various sources {{have been able to}} distinguish certain similarities among the flags: they were designed with a crescent-oriented shape {{in the presence of the}} colors blue, green, red, and white. Thereafter, and until the early 19th century, the flag was composed of horizontal blue, red and green stripes, identifying the Ottoman regency in <b>Tunis.</b> This kind of flag with multiple bands and irregular contours floated on top of ships all along the coast of North Africa; similar flags with different colors and arrangements were also used on the continent.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Arafat married Suha Tawil, a Palestinian Christian {{when he was}} 61 and Suha, 27. Before their marriage, she {{was working}} as a {{secretary}} for Arafat in <b>Tunis</b> after her mother introduced her to him in France. Prior to Arafat's marriage, he adopted fifty Palestinian war orphans.|$|E
5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke (born 1978) is a Tunis-born, Berlin-based visual artist {{best known}} for her {{conceptual}} art and 2011 sculpture Flying Carpets. Her work has explored themes of geopolitics, immigration, and transnational identities. Raised between <b>Tunis,</b> Kiev, and Dubai, she studied at the <b>Tunis</b> Institute of Fine Arts and received a Ph.D. in philosophy of art from the Sorbonne. Kaabi-Linke won the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize, which commissioned Flying Carpets, a hanging cage-like sculpture that casts geometric shadows onto the floor akin to the carpets of Venetian street vendors. The piece was acquired by the New York Guggenheim in 2016 as part of their Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative. Kaabi-Linke also won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong. Her works have been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Burger Collection, and Samdani Art Foundation, and exhibited in multiple solo and group shows.|$|E
5|$|Operation Flax was a Western Allied air {{operation}} executed during the Tunisia Campaign, {{as part of}} the larger North African Campaign of the Second World War. The operation was designed to cut the air supply lines between Italy and the Axis armies in <b>Tunis,</b> Tunisia, in April 1943. The parallel Allied naval effort was Operation Retribution.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Crusaders {{intended}} {{to relieve the}} beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre, but Louis had been diverted to <b>Tunis.</b> The French King and his brother Charles of Anjou, who had made himself King of Sicily, decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa. The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25August, took the life of King Louis himself. By the time Edward arrived at <b>Tunis,</b> Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little else to do but return to Sicily. The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm {{off the coast of}} Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor Philip III from any further campaigning. Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9May 1271he finally landed at Acre.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{and during}} Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both {{civilian and military}} targets. He prepared Beirut's defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon {{with the rest of}} the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to <b>Tunis</b> in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in <b>Tunis,</b> by Israeli commandos.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisian-Sicilian War {{occurred}} between June 1801 and April 1804, when Tunisian pirates with Tunisian and Algerian military support attacked and captured several Sicilian ships. The {{main purpose of}} their attacks was to capture Christian-European slaves for the Muslim-Arab slave market in North Africa. The Sicilians defeated the forces of <b>Tunis</b> and then occupied Bizerte and La Goulette until 1808.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 3,368 athletes (2,183 men and 1,185 women) from 23 member {{nations of the}} International Committee of Mediterranean Games participated (ICMG) in the Games. The number of {{participating}} countries was the greatest in Mediterranean Games history (equivalent to <b>Tunis</b> 2005). The total number of female athletes was an all-time high. Women {{took part in the}} Games {{for the first time in}} 1967. Italy and Greece had the largest teams, with 452 athletes for Italy and 391 for Greece. Andorra sent the smallest delegation of 13 members.|$|E
5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of <b>Tunis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1894, the Fasci were outlawed and brutally {{repressed}} on {{the orders}} of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. Many leaders were put in jail; Cascioferro fled to <b>Tunis</b> for a year. After serving his sentence {{for his role in}} the peasant unrest, Cascioferro returned to a position of social power and pressured authorities in Palermo to put him in charge of granting emigration permits in the district of Corleone. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo, Cascioferro was involved in clandestine emigration networks.|$|E
5|$|In March 1943, Private First Class Joseph (Jose) R. Martinez, {{member of}} Patton's Seventh Army, {{destroyed}} a German Infantry unit and tank in <b>Tunis</b> by providing heavy artillery fire, saving his platoon from being attacked in the process. He received the Distinguished Service Cross, {{second to the}} Medal of Honor, from General George S. Patton, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican recipient of said military decoration.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{used the}} Jews of Rome as slave labour on the {{construction}} of fortifications – as he had earlier done with those of <b>Tunis.</b> When ordered to deport the Roman Jews, Kesselring resisted. He announced that no resources were available to carry out such an order. Hitler then transferred responsibility to the SS. About 2,000 Roman Jews were ultimately deported between October 1943 and June 1944, half of them on 16 October 1943. During the German occupation of Italy, the Germans were believed to have killed some 46,000 Italian civilians, including 7,000 Jews.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements for 2nd Parachute Battalion {{arrived from}} Britain {{to make good}} the battalion's losses, and on 11 December it moved to Souk el Khemis, linking up {{with the rest of}} the Brigade. As Frost and his men retreated from Oudna, the Brigade had been {{informed}} it would be used in an infantry role, and on 11 December it came under the operational control of British V Corps and moved to positions near Beda; when it arrived No. 1 Commando and a French unit, 2e Bataillon 9e Regiment de Tirailleurs Algeriennes, were assigned to its command. The brigade took up defensive positions around Beda and deployed patrols around the immediate vicinity, but remained in a static role; on 21 December it was placed under the command of 78th Infantry Division to participate in an attack towards <b>Tunis,</b> but heavy rain caused this operation to be cancelled. When it was decided that continuing poor weather made any further assault towards <b>Tunis</b> impractical, Brigadier Flavell asked that the brigade be transferred to the rear so that it could be used in an airborne role. His request was denied, however, as V Corps stated that there were insufficient troops to replace the brigade; as such it remained in its positions, defending the entire Beda area.|$|E
5|$|The War Memorial Hall (more {{generally}} {{known as}} Memorial Hall) is a landmark {{building on the}} campus of McGill University. At the dedication ceremony the Governor General of Canada (Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of <b>Tunis)</b> laid the cornerstone. Dedicated on October 6, 1946, the Memorial Hall and adjoining Memorial Pool honour students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. In Memorial Hall, there are two Stained Glass Regimental badge World War I and World War II Memorial Windows by Charles William Kelsey c. 1950/1.|$|E
5|$|The {{diverging}} {{interests of}} the League members began to show, and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don John attacked and took <b>Tunis,</b> only {{for it to be}} retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of her Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of Friuli, and eager to cut her losses and resume the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated unilateral negotiations with the Porte.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>Tunis</b> never {{considered}} himself a children's writer, {{all but one}} of his twenty-four books were published for juveniles; their success helped create the juvenile fiction book market in the 1940s. Books like Iron Duke (1938), All American (1942) and Keystone Kids (1943) were well received by readers and critics. Iron Duke received the New York Herald Tribune Spring Book Festival Award for best juvenile novel and was named a The Horn Book Magazine Best Book. The Child Study Association of America gave its Golden Scroll Award to Keystone Kids.|$|E
5|$|When Israel besieged Beirut in 1982, al-Wazir, {{disagreed}} with the PLO's leftist members and Salah Khalaf; he proposed that the PLO pull out of Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut's defense and helped direct PLO forces against the IDF. PLO forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, {{with most of the}} leadership relocating to <b>Tunis,</b> although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by King Hussein of Jordan.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} the {{captured}} Yugoslav warships, notably Dubrovnik, Beograd and the repaired Ljubljana, were employed by the Italian Regia Marina until the armistice in 1943, whereupon the German Kriegsmarine, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, appropriated the surviving vessels for their own fleets. Ljubljana was wrecked on a shoal near the Gulf of <b>Tunis</b> whilst in Italian service in April 1943, and Dalmacija entered German service with her previous German name Niobe, but was soon transferred to the Croatian navy as Zniam. Beached on Silba island, she was destroyed by British MTBs in December 1943. Dubrovnik and Beograd were not sunk by Allied forces until April and May 1945 respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, <b>Tunis</b> began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera. For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E
5|$|After {{having won}} {{control of the}} seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of <b>Tunis.</b>|$|E
5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital <b>Tunis.</b> Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E
5|$|In November 1974, British Airways Flight 870 was hijacked {{shortly after}} {{take-off}} from Dubai for London Heathrow. The Vickers VC10 landed at Tripoli for refuelling before flying on to <b>Tunis.</b> The captain, Jim Futcher, {{returned to the}} aircraft to fly it knowing the hijackers were on board. The hijackers eventually surrendered after 84 hours, but not before a hostage was murdered. Futcher was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal, the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Founders Medal, the British Air Line Pilots Association Gold Medal and a Certificate of Commendation from British Airways for his actions during the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg {{was killed}} in action in his Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 16 381) on 23 March 1943 over Tunisia when his 135th victim, a USAAF 52nd Fighter Group Spitfire {{exploded}} {{in front of him}} after a close burst of cannon fire. The Spitfire was piloted by Captain Theodore Sweetman. Müncheberg managed to bail out and landed severely wounded. Although the search team quickly recovered him, Müncheberg died {{on the way to a}} field hospital. Captain Hugh L. Williamson, who was also shot down in the engagement, later stated that Sweetmann had deliberately rammed Müncheberg with his burning Spitfire. Müncheberg was buried originally at El Aouina; his remains were moved to the Heroes Cemetery at <b>Tunis</b> and later reinterred in the 1950s at the German Military Cemetery at Bordj-Cedria. The Wehrmachtbericht announced his death on 25 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|The French, led by Charles, {{similarly}} {{sought to}} expand their influence; Charles seized Sicily and Byzantine territory while marrying his daughters to the Latin claimants to Byzantium. To create his own claim to the throne of Jerusalem, Charles executed one rival and purchased {{the rights to the}} city from another. In 1270 Charles turned his brother King LouisIX's last Crusade, known as the Eighth Crusade, to his own advantage by persuading Louis to attack his rebel Arab vassals in <b>Tunis.</b> Louis' army was devastated by disease, and Louis himself died at <b>Tunis</b> on 25August. Louis' fleet returned to France, leaving only Prince Edward, the future king of England, and a small retinue to continue {{what is known as the}} Ninth Crusade. Edward survived an assassination attempt organised by Baibars, negotiated a ten-year truce, and then returned to manage his affairs in England. This ended the last significant crusading effort in the Eastern Mediterranean. The 1281 election of a French pope, MartinIV, brought the full power of the papacy into line behind Charles. He prepared to launch a crusade against Constantinople but, in what became known as the Sicilian Vespers, an uprising fomented by MichaelVIII Palaiologos deprived him of the resources of Sicily, and Peter III of Aragon was proclaimed king of Sicily. In response, Martin excommunicated Peter and called for an Aragonese Crusade, which was unsuccessful. In 1285 Charles died, having spent his life trying to amass a Mediterranean empire; he and Louis had viewed themselves as God's instruments to uphold the papacy.|$|E
5|$|The Mareth Line {{constituted}} {{one of two}} fronts in the Tunisia Campaign, {{the second}} being to the north-west, where the British First Army and American II Corps, firmly established in formerly Vichy-held Morocco and Algeria following Operation Torch in November 1942, were gradually pushing the Axis forces under Hans-Jürgen von Arnim back towards <b>Tunis.</b> After von Arnim won a decisive victory over the Americans at the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid in mid-February 1943, destroying over 100 US tanks, the Eighteenth Army Group was formed under the British General Harold Alexander to co-ordinate {{the actions of the}} Allied forces on both Tunisian fronts.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival No. 6 Commando took up {{defensive}} {{positions in}} the orange groves alongside troops from the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, the Royal West Kents {{and a number of}} Frenchmen that decided to join their cause. A brief period of lull followed where the commandos were mainly involved in defending the airfield against air attacks from the Luftwaffe, before they moved off again {{to take part in the}} fighting around Medjez-el-Bab, where they fought on the left flank of the first French regular forces to engage the Germans since the fall of France in 1940, forming the spearhead of the advance towards <b>Tunis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in <b>Tunis</b> – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to <b>Tunis</b> before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 22 October 1793, Agamemnon sighted five sails. Nelson closed with them, and {{discovered}} they were a French squadron. He promptly gave chase, firing on the 40-gun Melpomene. During the Action of 22 October 1793 he inflicted considerable damage but the remaining French ships turned to join the battle and, realising he was outnumbered, Nelson withdrew and continued to Cagliari, arriving on 24 October. After making repairs, Nelson and Agamemnon sailed again on 26 October, bound for <b>Tunis</b> with a squadron under Commodore Robert Linzee. On his arrival, Nelson was given command of a small squadron consisting of Agamemnon, three frigates and a sloop, and ordered to blockade the French garrison on Corsica. The fall of Toulon at the end of December 1793 severely damaged British fortunes in the Mediterranean. Hood had failed to make adequate provision for a withdrawal and 18 French ships-of-the-line fell into republican hands. Nelson's mission to Corsica took on added significance, as it could provide the British a naval base close to the French coast. Hood therefore reinforced Nelson with extra ships during January 1794.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Maariv {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} assassination of al-Wazir. The report claimed that Ehud Barak led a seaborne command center on a navy missile boat off the shore of <b>Tunis</b> that oversaw al-Wazir's assassination. Up until 1 November 2012, Israel however did not take official responsibility for his killing and government spokesman Moshe Fogel and aides to Barak {{declined to comment on}} the issue. According to the report, Barak, who was then a deputy military chief, coordinated the planning by the Mossad, as well as the army's intelligence branch, the air force, navy and the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit. Mossad intelligence agents watched al-Wazir's home for months before the raid. The Washington Post reported on 21 April that the Israeli cabinet approved al-Wazir's assassination on 13 April and that it was coordinated between the Mossad and the IDF.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the {{alliance}} lost another two affiliate members as British Airways continued {{the strategy of}} reducing its UK franchises. The first franchisee, GBAirways, exited {{the alliance}} on 30 March 2008, following its purchase by EasyJet. British Airways intended to start services from London Heathrow to Faro, Portugal, and Málaga, Spain, and from London Gatwick to Faro, Gibraltar, Ibiza, Málaga, Palma, and <b>Tunis,</b> which were operated under the franchise. The alliance bid farewell to one of its affiliate member Japan Asia Airways on 31 March 2008, following the airline's consolidation into its parent, Japan Airlines. The second British Airways franchisee, Loganair, left the alliance on 25 October 2008, following the ending of its franchise agreement with the airline. A separate agreement for codesharing on some Loganair services replaced the previous franchise, for British Airways passengers connecting through Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|E
