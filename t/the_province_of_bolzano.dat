In the Italian {{portion of the}} South-Eastern Alps these archives are managed by the Veneto Region and by <b>the</b> <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano</b> and Trento, {{as part of the}} Italian Inventory of Landslides. About 750 rockfall events recorded in these archives were checked, put together and completed to create a new integrated database. Information on 24 new rockfalls were added from different research sources. Descriptive statistic shows that the most affected slopes with the highest frequency of rockfall are the southern ones. The distribution of rockfalls during the year presents three peaks in March, June and November. The most commonly affected lithologies are massive dolomites, effusive rocks and mica schists. Roads proved to be the most commonly involved feature. The hypsographic curves obtained from <b>the</b> DEMs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Belluno, <b>Bolzano</b> and Trento have shown that the different areas potentially affected by periglacial processes experience rockfalls during summer and autumn, thus representing a risk to tourists and hikers.

50|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South Tyrol, Bolzano was {{subjected}} to an intensive Italianisation programme enforced by Fascist leader Benito Mussolini from the 1920s onwards to September 8, 1943, when Italy left the military alliance with Nazi-Germany and South Tyrol fell under direct German control. The goal of such programme was to outnumber the local German-speaking population by tripling Bolzano's population through Italian immigration from other regions of Italy. In 1927 Bolzano became the capital of <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano.</b> Any reference to and use of the words Tyrol and Tyrolean were banned by law and were punishable offences. In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in the Weimar Republic. Mussolini and the Fascists worried that Hitler, in pursuing his ideology of all ethnic Germans under one Reich, would claim South Tyrol from Italy. To avoid such prospect, in 1939 Mussolini and Hitler signed the Option Agreement, by which Germany would renounce territorial claims over South Tyrol as Germany's Lebensraum (living space). Furthermore, ethnic South-Tyroleans who had opted to stay in South Tyrol and refused resettlement to the Third Reich were subjected to full-scale Italianisation, including loss of their German names and national identity, prohibition of schooling in German and use of German for their daily transactions.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the last}} months of World War II, the Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini and other diehard fascist leaders of the Italian Social Republic (RSI) proposed making a [...] "last stand" [...] against the advancing Allied armies in the Valtellina. The Fascist Party secretary Alessandro Pavolini was the main proponent of the idea, which he first raised with Mussolini in September 1944. He pointed out that the valley was ringed with fortifications dating from World War I, and had its own electricity generating capacity (hydroelectric). In {{the last months}} of 1944 Mussolini's government began moving munitions and food stores to the area. By January 1945, however, no firm decision to make a stand in the Valtellina had been taken. The Germans, represented by Ambassador Rudolf Rahn, were opposed to the idea. In March, with the Allies advancing into the Po valley, Mussolini's Cabinet again discussed the idea. The RSI's military commander, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, who believed the war was already lost, opposed the plan. This ensured that no serious military preparations were made. In early April Pavolini again raised the plan, which he called [...] "the Epic of the 50,000," [...] claiming that 50,000 Blackshirts would follow Mussolini if he made a stand in the Valtellina. The Germans, who by this time were negotiating with the Allies to surrender their armies in Italy, remained adamantly opposed. Filippo Anfuso, the RSI's under-secretary for foreign affairs, pointed out that valley was already mostly {{in the hands of the}} partisans. By mid April, the Valtellina plan was no longer a realistic possibility. Although Mussolini continued to fantasise about dying a heroic death there, the plan had no serious support. When Mussolini left Milan on 25 April, heading north, it was assumed he was going to the Valtellina, but his intentions were never made clear - he told some people he would go to Bolzano, in <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano,</b> to join up with German forces. In any event Mussolini's capture on 27 April by the partisans at Dongo, barely short of the Valtellina, ended any possibility of a fascist last stand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{importance}} of individual perceptions, schools often assess how students or teachers or parents feel about their school, and school climate has often been associated with improved school achievement, but rarely they take into account all these “actors” at the same time. The main aim of this work is to compare the results obtained in a population study on school climate that involves students, parents, teachers and non-teaching staff. In this paper, we will present the results of parents’, students’, teachers’ and no-teacher personnel's perception. We have administered 13, 500 structured questionnaires addressed to students, parents, teachers, educational assistance personnel, involved in the four orders of schools (Pre-school, Elementary, Middle, High) of <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano.</b> Parental permission was obtained for young people. The present study has been conducted in <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano,</b> northern Italy, between January and April 2012. A School Climate Perception Questionnaire (SCPQ), that can be completed in 10 minutes, has been developed to assess environments and climate of all Italian language schools. In order to determine the interrelationships among the questionnaire items, a Principal-Axis Factor Analysis was performed. The final scale was used for Confirmatory Factor Analysis that was done to assess its construct validity.

40|$|In the Italian {{region of}} Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, the legal {{regulation}} of place names has a peculiar relief {{due to the}} ethnic composition of the population, which is protected by several statutory provisions. Moreover, that regulation shows different connotations in consideration of the primary legislative power conferred {{in the matter of}} “toponymy” to the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano and in consideration of the regional legislative power with regard to the municipal toponymy. The paper focuses on the different approach followed by the provincial legislatures in the legal regulation of toponymy. If the province of Trento has not hesitated to use the powers conferred by the statute, having care to regulate the toponymy of the Ladin population {{as well as of the}} other smaller minority groups, <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano</b> has not yet succeeded in enacting an exhaustive regulation according to the statutory provisions. The numerous attempts of regulation till now uselessly produced by the political bodies testify the difficulty to conclude a legislative reform that is particularly delicate in the ethnically mixed areas for the intimate connections that it sets among linguistic groups, historical memory of the places, protection of the respective cultural heritages. The different initiatives adopted until now have periodically stirred up the debate on questions that should be pacific, according to the norms provided in the special statute of the region, which were adopted in order to carry out specific international obligations. In fact, the 1946 Paris Agreement as well as the two versions of the regional statute stated the obligation of bilingual place names in the territory of <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano.</b> That principle is an exception to the so-called criterion of the “linguistic separatism” which is generally adopted in the region for the protection of the linguistic minorities. The persistent lack of regulation of toponymy in <b>the</b> <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bolzano</b> determines, from a legal point of view, the maintenance into force of the discipline approved during the fascist regime. In the daily experience, the not-fulfilment of the international and statutory obligations has contributed in these years, on the one side, to keep alive in the local population the discussion on a theme apparently of cultural and folklore importance but in reality of political and social impact, and, on the other side, to feed a diffused dissatisfaction especially in the Italian population that often is compelled to watch the introduction, as a matter of fact, of place names which are expressed in the German language only or to watch fanciful translations in German of place names originally expressed also in the Italian language...|$|E
