5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
5|$|If {{no signs}} of an {{allergic}} reaction are present, an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting.

5|$|Mountain {{climbing}} on Mount Rainier is difficult, involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> {{to reach the}} summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%.

About 8,000 to 13,000people attempt the climb each year, about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank.|$|E

5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} oval white eggs, laid two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> apart, are most {{commonly}} laid in a clutch, though {{there can be}} anywhere from one to five. They average 41.6mm long by 35.5mm wide, and are finely pitted. The female alone incubates the eggs, during which time she is fed by the male. She does leave the nest at dusk for around half an hour, sometimes to bathe. Incubation takes 30–31 days.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Cape Fear {{experienced}} minor beach erosion. The erosion, {{combined with}} high waves, washed out {{a portion of}} a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000buildings without power. Many places were not restored for two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after the storm. Wind and storm surge damaged over 100houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5million (2004USD). Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; the scenes set around the Osbourne {{residence}} for instance, were all filmed at once, during two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> though during the episodes, the scenes took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts of the sequence were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were shot by the second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to double as a beach.|$|E

5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach surface waters, where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} hard surface to which they can attach and begin a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> but can be up to two months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. This usually lasts two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> The improvement is often striking, {{and can be}} accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
