Twenty-two parents of children with developmental disabilities and conduct problems (the disability group), and 17 parents of children with conduct problems, but without developmental disabilities (the conduct problems group), were assessed before and after participating in the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>Programme,</b> and at 10 months follow-up. More than 70 % of cases in both the disability and conduct problems groups showed clinically significant improvement on the Total Difficulties scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. During the follow-up period, parents in the disability group showed a deterioration in psychological adjustment (on the General Health Questionnaire- 12), while parents in the conduct problems group showed an improvement. Parents in the disability group reported a higher level of goal attainment compared with parents in the conduct problem group. Parents in both the disability and conduct problems groups evaluated the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>Programme</b> equally positively. The Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>Programme</b> requires refinement to become more effective for families of pre-school children with developmental disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> with families of pre-school children with developmental disabilities and significant behavioural problems in the Irish health service. The Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> is a group-based parent training package involving video modelling, which was designed to be effective for children with conduct problems, but without developmental disabilities. Materials and Methods: Pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted with 22 treated cases and 19 waiting-list controls with a protocol that included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Child Behaviour Checklist, the General Health Questionnaire- 12, the Kansas Parental Satisfaction Scale, the Family Assessment Device, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes, the Parenting Stress Index and the Questionnaire on Resources and Stress. Results: Following the treatment, a comparison of treatment and control group means showed that the treated group showed better adjustment on the total difficulties scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. These gains were maintained at 10 -month follow-up. Fifty per cent of treated cases showed clinically significant improvement and 14 % showed reliable change on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The treatment group reported a high level of satisfaction with the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> and showed significant goal attainment after treatment and at follow-up. Conclusions: For some families of pre-school children with developmental disabilities and significant behavioural problems, the Parents <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> is an effective intervention and may be incorporated into routine early intervention clinics in the Irish health service. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on the development, implementation and evaluation processes of physical activity promotion programmes among older adults. More integrative insights into interventions describing the planned systematic development, implementation and evaluation are needed. Methods and design The {{purpose of this study is}} to give an integrative insight into the development of the Active <b>plus</b> <b>programme</b> applying the six-step Intervention Mapping protocol. The Active <b>plus</b> <b>programme</b> consisted of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity promotion interventions, both comprising three tailored letters delivered over four months and aimed at raising awareness of insufficient physical activity, and stimulating physical activity initiation and maintenance among the over-fifties. The first intervention, the basic tailored intervention, provided tailored letters that intervened on the psychosocial determinants of physical activity. The second intervention, the intervention plus, provided the same tailored information but additionally provided tailored information about physical activity opportunities in the specific environment in which the older adults lived. This environment-based component also provided access to a forum and e-buddy system on a website. A plan for implementation and evaluation is also described. Discussion The planned development of the Active <b>plus</b> <b>programme</b> resulted in two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions targeted at the over-fifties.

40|$|The {{production}} and processing of primary products {{is the basis}} of the New Zealand economy and has been for the last 150 years. Over time the food and fibre industries that have contributed to our economic welfare have had a significant ecological impact. The dependence of New Zealandâ€™s economic and social well-being on these industries means {{there is a need to}} find ways in which these industries can operate sustainably. Sustainable outcomes require an understanding of both the physical demands our economy places on the natural resources of the nation and the extent to which these demands can be changed. Resource appropriation and eco-efficiency measures are ways environmental impact can be estimated. This paper reports the methodology and preliminary findings from the first phase of the Ecological Footprint <b>Plus</b> <b>programme.</b> This programme will construct a physical inputâ€“output table (PIOT) for New Zealand to enable the development of a comprehensive understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of the food and fibre sector. Data are input at a detailed and disaggregated level for the key primary sectors and at a more aggregated level for the other sectors of the economy. The Ecological Footprint <b>Plus</b> <b>programme</b> aims both to measure throughputs and to provide the catalyst necessary for the changes required to ensure the sustainable production of New Zealandâ€™s primary output. Preliminary analyses for the Forestry and Logging and Sheep and Beef Farming sectors are given for use of water, land, and energy as well as emissions of carbon dioxide...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} bachelor thesis {{concentrates on}} the analysis of construction expenditures dutiny the process of introducing material and construction changes. We have selected four variant of the given construction systems supplied by four different providers. This has been conducted under the following condition: all the four variants has a common heat transfer coefficient. U= 0, 14 [W/m 2 K]. Among the selected systems we have included Heluz, Velox, Porotherm and Ytong. Under Heluz system we have chosen Heluz Family, ground surface, thickness 500 mm. This system does not involved contact insulation. As for Porotherm, we have decided for ceramic breeze blocks Porotherm 30, thickness 300 mm, to follow the obligatory common heat transfer coefficient, therefore we have also suggested contact insulation as of 220 mm. The third system, Velox permanent boarding, VELOX WS EPS PLUS thickness 420 [mm]. This system fully complies with the heat transfer coefficient requirements. Finally, we have used Ytong breeze blocks 300 mm in thickness. For this solution there also arose a need to design the contact insulation to follow the heat transfer coefficient requirements. For ech project variant we have designed project documuntation as a the basis for further budget item calculations pertinent to each single project variant. The item budget calculation was made using KROS <b>PLUS</b> <b>programme.</b> The overall budget prices and variables in each project variant have been comapred with each other, the data processed into several graphs accordingly. Among the variables we have included ground works, founding, vertical and complete constructions, horizontal constructions, surfaÅ™e finishing works, flooring and filling works, thermal insulations. Furthermore, purchasing prices for each invividual type of material, based on provider prices list, have been compared with prices as given by KROS <b>PLUS</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|R
