We use capital and staff as inputs and <b>tonne-kilometres</b> <b>available</b> as a desirable output to evaluate operation stage efficiency and {{productivity of the}} world 2 Ì† 7 s major airlines between 2007 and 2013. Our results demonstrate European airlines are relatively stronger performers {{in terms of both}} pollution-adjusted operational efficiency and productivity. Middle-Eastern airlines have made gains in terms of output growth but perform poorly in terms of pollution-adjusted productivity, evidence that ETSs may produce greener airlines...|$|E
