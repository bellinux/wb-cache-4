25|$|The {{original}} {{base fabric}} {{on which the}} images are embroidered is a woven purple gauze, {{which may have been}} imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple twill or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches.

25|$|Fertility rates. “Religions {{with many}} adherents in {{developing}} countries, where birth rates are high, and infant mortality rates generally have been falling, {{are likely to}} grow quickly.” Therefore, much {{of the growth of}} Christianity is projected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, Christians have a birth rate of 2.7 children per woman. But Muslims have a higher rate, namely, an average of 3.1 children per woman. This differential is one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Muslim population is growing faster than the Christian.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Provisional IRA and Provisional Sinn Féin were founded, in December 1969 and January 1970, respectively, {{was that}} people like Ó Brádaigh, O'Connell and McKee opposed {{participation}} in constitutional politics. The other reason was {{the failure of the}} Cathal Goulding leadership to provide for the defence of Irish nationalist areas during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. When, at the December 1969 IRA convention and the January 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, the delegates voted to participate in the Dublin (Leinster House), Belfast (Stormont) and London (Westminster) parliaments, the organisations split. Adams, who had joined the republican movement in the early 1960s, sided with the Provisionals.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese {{community}} in Puerto Rico did not flourish was because, in 1899, the War Department ordered the American officials in Puerto Rico {{to enforce the}} Chinese exclusion laws, as requested by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. They believed that Chinese agents were preparing to flood Puerto Rico with Chinese from other countries, who would eventually move on into the United States later. Although Chinese nationals {{were not allowed to}} go from Cuba to Puerto Rico, those who were in the United States were permitted to travel {{back and forth between the}} United States and Puerto Rico without restrictions. The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the 1943 Magnuson Act, although large-scale Chinese immigration did not occur until the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965.|$|E
25|$|The {{concordat}} {{caused a}} severe conflict between Holy See and Lithuania. The concordat established an ecclesiastical province in Wilno, thereby acknowledging Poland's {{claims to the}} city despite Lithuanian requests to govern the province directly from Rome. Lithuania and Poland {{had been in a}} bitter struggle for the city and the surrounding area since 1920 when the city was taken over by pro-Polish forces during Żeligowski's Mutiny. Lithuanians submitted a protest to the Holy See and recalled its representative there; the Holy See responded in kind and all diplomatic relations between Lithuania and the Holy See were terminated. In April 1926, Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized the Lithuanian ecclesiastical province without regard to Lithuanian demands and proposals. Popular outrage in response to the concordat was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, the leading pro-Catholic party in Lithuania, lost the majority in the 1926 parliamentary elections.|$|E
25|$|After McCain {{announced}} Palin as {{his running}} mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers, {{as some of the}} media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her. Among <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> news organizations criticized the restrictions was Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews. Her interview five days later with Fox News's Sean Hannity focuses on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview. However, Palin's performance in her third interview, with Katie Couric of CBS News, was widely criticized. Palin's responses to several of Couric's questions were considered embarrassing, most notably failing to name any newspapers she read. The fallout from the interview prompted a decline in her poll numbers, concern among Republicans that she was becoming a political liability, and calls from some conservative commentators for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket. Other conservatives remain ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism. Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.|$|E

25|$|Every {{household}} {{probably had}} {{members of the}} extended family who would work in the fields to raise crops, tend livestock, go to the woods to hunt game and bring back firewood, work by the river to bring back clay or fish, {{and all of the other}} duties that would be needed to survive. Contrary to popular belief, the Neolithic people experienced considerable abundance of food and other resources. This lack of competition for limited resources was probably one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cucuteni-Trypillia culture (as with most of the other European Neolithic cultures) had no evidence of war throughout their entire existence. If the population of a community became too large, and began to outstrip the ability of the surrounding environment to support the inhabitants' needs, there were still vast, unexploited territories around them that a break-off group could easily travel to and start a new settlement without fear of encroaching on some other group's territorial lands. These settlements did indeed grow and divide; during its existence the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's geographical region expanded immensely as the population increased and new communities were established.|$|E
25|$|While {{the state}} rooms {{occupied}} {{the northern and}} eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, {{the four corners of}} the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This is one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the Tsarevna, the arrangement of the rooms makes more sense. Similarly the vast White Hall, so far from the other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the Tsarevich's and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace {{can be viewed as a}} series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.|$|E

500|$|Yamato, and {{especially}} {{the story of her}} sinking, has appeared often in Japanese popular culture, such as the anime Space Battleship Yamato and the 2005 film Yamato.

One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> warship may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word [...] "Yamato" [...] was often used as a poetic name for Japan.

500|$|Equine breeds, {{such as the}} American Cream Draft, {{were among}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{organization}} was formed, and were on the earliest conservation priority lists.

Rabbits, having only {{been added to the}} CPL in 2005, have been among the least studied, although in 2010, the organization named the American Rabbit as the most endangered breed of rabbit in the US. Work with cattle has also been limited, although in one case, a member rescued the last of the Randall Cattle herd from slaughter; the breed has since been built up to more than 300 members. One major initiative with cattle [...] is the Heritage Dairy Cattle Breed Recovery program, which assists heritage cattle breeders and breed organizations with funding, marketing and communications, with a focus on selling their product to other small operations, including cheese and dairy operations.|$|E

However, according to an article in the Contra Costa Times that was published on the day the episode aired, [...] "all the advance rumors suggest that Ned Flanders' wife, Maude, should watch her back." [...] The revelation of the episode's title, [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly", was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> media and many people [...] suspected Maude.

500|$|Skate skiing was {{introduced}} to competition in the 20th Century. At the first German ski championship, held at the Feldberg in the Black Forest in 1900, the Norwegian Bjarne Nilssen won the 23km cross-country race and was observed using a skating motion while skiing—a technique unknown to the spectators. Johan Grøttumsbråten used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof, {{one of the earliest}} recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing. This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. Finnish skier Pauli Siitonen developed a variant of the style for marathon or other endurance events in the 1970s by leaving one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski (one-sided skating); this became known as the [...] "marathon skate". Bill Koch (USA) further developed the marathon skate technique in the late 1970s. Skate-skiing became widespread during the 1980s after Koch's success with it in the 1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the technique. Norwegian skier, Ove Aunli, started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style. Skating is most effective on wide, smooth, groomed trails, using fiberglass skis that glide well; it also benefits a stronger athlete—which, according to Olav Bø, are <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> technique made a breakthrough in the early 1980s. Athletes widely adopted skating to both sides {{by the time of the}} 1985 world championship and it was formally adopted by the FIS in 1986—despite initial opposition from Norway, the Soviet Union and Finland—while preserving events using only classic technique.|$|E
