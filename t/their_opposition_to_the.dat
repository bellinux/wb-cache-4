5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party. Such views were {{out of step with}} the majority of Oregonians, however, with the Republicans coming to dominate Oregon politics during the last quarter of the 19thcentury. Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman's anarchist journal, Mother Earth, and later {{established}} his own journal, The Blast. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet's use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. In 1925, he published a book about his experiences, The Bolshevik Myth.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E

50|$|In September 2004, several {{political}} groups (most are unofficial), {{on both the}} left and the right, announced <b>their</b> sharp <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inheritance of power. They demanded political change and a fair, multi-candidate election.|$|R
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|Many tribal councils {{have passed}} resolutions or issued {{statements}} regarding <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{name of the}} Washington Redskins, including the Cherokee and Comanche Nations of Oklahoma, the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, the Oneida Indian Nation (New York), the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (North Dakota) and the United South and Eastern Tribes (USET). In April 2014, Navajo Nation Council {{voted in favor of}} a statement opposing the name of the Washington team, as well as other disparaging references to American Indians by other professional sports franchises.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to enforce the}} revenue laws were met with stiff resistance {{from a number of}} Massachusetts communities. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties. The leaders of Ipswich, who had been most vocal in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> law, were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.|$|E

5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> article {{in an attempt to}} generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of {{the plan}} without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements {{of the plan}} were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević {{saw it as a}} dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June, Croatia and Slovenia {{agreed to}} suspend their {{declarations}} of independence to allow {{time for a}} negotiated settlement. The EC delegation appeared to make progress when Serbia responded to the move by ceasing <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> appointment of a Croatian member of the federal presidency, Stjepan Mesić, as the body's chairman on 30 June. The appearance of a success was reinforced when the JNA ordered its troops posted in Slovenia {{to return to their}} barracks. On 1 July, de Michelis was replaced by João de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, to maintain the formula of current, former and future EC presidencies comprising the EC delegation as the Netherlands took over the presidency from Luxembourg, while Portugal was scheduled to assume the presidency after the Dutch.|$|E

5|$|Quwatli {{returned}} to Syria in 1955, following {{the ouster of}} President Adib al-Shishakli and during the presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, {{at the age of}} 63. Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority was {{exempt from}} {{requirements}} {{to have a}} federal environmental impact study (EIS) conducted on the Creek Turnpike project. As part of <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> turnpike, Tulsans Against Turnpikes challenged this right. The group announced in April 1989 that if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) did not force OTA to conduct an EIS within 60 days they would sue the three federal agencies. Tulsans Against Turnpikes, joined by an area homeowners' association, John Reidel (a homeowner whose property was condemned by OTA and had filed previous suits {{as early as the}} 1950s to stop the turnpike's construction), and several other affected individuals, filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on August 10. Defendants in the suit included the federal agencies, state transportation and environmental agencies, and the city of Tulsa. That November, Tulsans Against Turnpikes filed a motion requesting an injunction against further work on the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|The Republican {{convention}} met first, convening in Chicago, Illinois, on June 2. Of the men {{vying for}} the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to the}} convention were former president Ulysses S. Grant, Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary John Sherman. Grant had been the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War, and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877. He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office. He was backed by Conkling's faction of the Republican Party, now known as the Stalwarts. They are mainly known for <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> civil service reforms sought by President Hayes. Blaine, a senator and former representative from Maine, was backed by the Half-Breed faction of the party, which did support civil service reform. Sherman, the brother of Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, was a former senator from Ohio serving in Hayes's cabinet. He was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions.|$|E

5|$|The {{agitation}} {{was backed}} by Periyar's Self-Respect Movement and Justice Party. It also {{had the support of}} Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal, Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars {{were among the first to}} announce <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hindi teaching in the Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja conference at Velur. Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. Moovalur Ramamirtham, Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation. On 13 November 1938, the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement. The agitation was marked by anti-Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Despite the general anti-Brahminism of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the freeway}} began in 1954, with the {{proposal}} for a freeway from Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway, later I-5, via Broad and Mercer streets added to the city's comprehensive plan in 1957. Funded by a bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1960, plans were drawn for the newly renamed Bay Freeway to serve a multi-purpose stadium at the Seattle Center via an elevated structure. Citizen groups voiced <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project at public hearings in 1967, forcing the Seattle Engineering Department to consider other designs. After determining that a cut-and-cover tunnel would not be feasible, a second series of public hearings to discuss the impact of an elevated option were held in 1970, leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched {{in opposition to the}} freeway. The lawsuit ended in November 1971, with a King County Superior Court judge ruling that a major deviation from the voter-approved 1960 plan occurred, forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue the project. On February 8, 1972, the Bay Freeway project was rejected by a 10,000-vote margin in a municipal referendum, alongside the repeal of the R.H. Thomson Expressway. Mercer Street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by the rejected freeway, culminating in the Mercer Corridor Project in 2012, which widened the street into a boulevard.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, a public-opinion {{survey in}} <b>the</b> lead-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> May 2003 local {{government}} elections caused <b>the</b> council <b>to</b> rethink {{its support of}} the new plan. <b>Their</b> new-found <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposed beachfront high-rise apartments focused on Magic Mountain as the one parcel of land within the project that was under their control.|$|R

25|$|The United Nations {{established}} supervising {{and reporting}} agencies {{to monitor the}} established armistice lines. In addition, discussions related to the armistice enforcement, led to {{the signing of the}} separate Tripartite Declaration of 1950 between the United States, Britain, and France. In it, they pledged to take action within and outside the United Nations to prevent violations of the frontiers or armistice lines. It also outlined their commitment to peace and stability in the area, <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use or threat of force, and reiterated <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of an arms race. These lines held until the 1967 Six-Day War.|$|E
25|$|These riots became {{still more}} violent when the leftists resorted to {{terrorist}} attacks, planting fake and real bombs {{in the city}} and murdering some members of the press who voiced <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> violence.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, many American lodges relaxed <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Grand Orient de France {{to allow}} {{servicemen}} {{to engage with}} other masons while in France.

25|$|During the Lewisham North and Warwick and Leamington by-elections held in February and March 1957, Labour {{instructed}} its activists not <b>to</b> emphasise <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Suez because <b>the</b> government's action {{had considerable}} support.|$|R
