Five of the surviving Merchant Navy's have run in preservation, these being: 35005, 35006, 35018, 35027 & 35028. Three of them have even run on the mainline at some points in preservation: 35005 Canadian Pacific, 35018 British India Line and 35028 Clan Line, Both 35018 and 35028 are currently mainline certified.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Ruter decided <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> {{all of the}} T2000 wagons, {{after only}} 16 years in operation, and ten of the wagons were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund.

Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the wagons for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E

5|$|King George Vs active naval {{career was}} {{terminated}} by the Royal Navy in June 1950, {{when she and}} her sister-ships went into reserve and were mothballed. King George V was the first large warship to be preserved in this fashion. This involved sealing the armament, machinery and boilers against damp and installing dehumidifiers throughout. In December 1955, she was downgraded to extended reserve and in 1957 the decision was taken <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> the four ships. The following year King George V was moved from her berth in Gareloch to the ship breaking firm of Arnott Young and Co. in Dalmuir to undergo dismantling.|$|E

On 5September 2017 the bridge carried its final private cars, as the vast majority of traffic was transferred to the new Queensferry Crossing. Following a few weeks closure for repairs, the new role of the Forth Road Bridge will be as a public transport corridor, open only to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. At its peak, the Forth Road Bridge carried 65,000 vehicles per day (vpd), which is now expected to drop to only a few hundred following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 was {{the victim}} of ever-rising costs and inter-service squabbling over Britain's future defence needs, which led to the {{controversial}} decision <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> the programme in 1965. With the election of a new government, the TSR-2 was cancelled due to rising costs, in favour of purchasing an adapted version of the General Dynamics F-111, a decision that itself was later rescinded as costs and development times increased. The replacements included the Blackburn Buccaneer and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, both of which had previously been considered and rejected early in the TSR-2 procurement process. Eventually, the smaller swing-wing Panavia Tornado was developed and adopted by a European consortium to fulfil broadly similar requirements to the TSR-2.|$|E

The database was heavily criticised by a wide range of groups, mainly for privacy, security and child protection reasons.

5|$|The {{ship had}} a very limited service life. At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal.

Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> dealers.|$|E

5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was {{declared}} of {{age at the}} Parlement of Rouen, {{but he was never}} able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 2011, Edinburgh Council {{voted to}} {{continue}} the line between Edinburgh Airport and St Andrew Square. Costs rose to an estimated £770m, leaving the council with a shortfall of more than £200m. The option <b>to</b> <b>scrap</b> the project was considered, but rejected. On 25 August 2011, the council voted to cut the line to run between the airport and Haymarket, reducing the expected cost to £715m. A week later, after the Scottish Government threatened to withhold £72 million of funding, the council reversed its decision, restoring the terminus at St Andrew Square. On 29 November 2011 {{it was announced that}} the eastern terminus would be at York Place instead of St Andrew Square; the intention had been to build the tracks to a reversing point at York Place (without a stop for passengers). Extending passenger services from St Andrew Square to York Place would enable Broughton Street, Picardy Place and the surrounding area to be better served at comparatively little additional cost.|$|E
