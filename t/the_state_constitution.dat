50|$|Each of <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> {{has its own}} {{governing}} <b>Constitution.</b> <b>The</b> <b>States</b> <b>Constitutions</b> {{are usually}} longer and written in much more detail than the U.S. Constitution. For example, the Alabama Constitution has more than 600 pages and the New Jersey Constitution of 1947 is three times longer than the U.S. Constitution. The reason for this difference between the federal <b>Constitution</b> and <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>Constitutions</b> is what Justice Brennan called 'the new judicial federalism'. meaning that rights granted by <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>Constitutions</b> can be broader than those comprised by the federal Constitution but not narrowed.|$|R
