50|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, the Warren, {{later the}} Royal Arsenal, had grown to rival the Tower of London as the country's main {{ordnance}} depot. The ropeyard was rebuilt in 1695-97 by the surveyor and naval engineer Edmund Dummer, adding a double ropewalk to the existing one. The yard was extended to 324 m, stretching all the way to Green's End. At its north end stood a brick warehouse with a clock tower. It employed as many as 400 men. This, and the shipbuilding at Woolwich Dockyard, attracted ever more workers to Woolwich, which due to the malarial marshland was not a popular posting. However, the town's population grew rapidly, to about 6,500 in 1720. The entire area between the Dockyard and the Warren was filled in with houses. The south part of Gun Yard (facing the High Street) was developed in the 1720s as a market surrounded by houses on three sides and with a central market office. The northern part of the plot remained in use as a riverside wharf throughout the 18th century, partly for stacking timber. The parish church of St Mary Magdalene was rebuilt in the 1730s through aid from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. The new church was bigger and stood slightly further back from the river. John Rocque's Map of London of 1746 shows very few buildings south of the main east-west street and the ropeyard. Five streets, all perpendicular to the High Street, are marked on the map: Hog Lane, Bell Water Gate, Taler <b>Tree</b> <b>Gate,</b> Ship Stairs and Warren Lane. Apart from that, the built-up area consisted of Church Hill, Parson's Hill, Woolwich High Street, a pocket of houses between the Ropeyard and the Warren, and a scattering of cottages at Green's End (now Beresford Square). On another map of 1748-49 the so-called watermen's stairs are marked, used for loading and offloading ships. They are all situated at the north ends of the aforementioned streets, some with poetic names: Green Dragon Stairs, Blue Anchor Stairs and Sheep (or Ship) Stairs.|$|E

K Darling, a British {{archaeologist}} {{in one of}} {{his works}} also described it as the “Largest ancient built stone walls in the whole of Africa.” It was believed that Surame and the associated site of Gungu, are the biggest stone cities with great potentials in archaeological value covering over 28 square kilometres between Binji and Silame local government areas.There were 14 gates to Surame City. These gates were categorized as seven great gates and seven smaller gates. The great gates connected the city with the outside world, while the seven smaller gates connected different sections of the city. Six hundred years after it was destroyed some of the gates are still standing at the site. One of the standing gates is referred to as Dashe <b>tree</b> <b>gate.</b> It was named after the Dashe tree that was standing there before the gate was created in the 15th century. The stone arrangement of the city gates, security posts, the narrow paths leading into the city through the gates, the two concentric stone walls, rectangular palace walls and the enclosures built to fortify it against external attacks, are some of the awesome features that still exist at the site till today.The Kanta palace was trapezium in shape. It used to be the seat of power and authority of the Kabi Kingdom where King Kanta resided in the 15th century. It was said to be several metres high. Even though it has collapsed, rubbles of its foundation within the rectangular walls that surrounded the palace, still serve as evidence of what Kanta’s palace looked like in those days. The palace has many historical features which include the ancient well believed to be over 500 years old, circular foundations of the houses built for the wives of the king and his disciples. Though the palace is in ruins and the houses at Surame city are gone their foundations remain intact till the present day. The Baobab tree that symbolized the king’s power and authority when Kabi Kingdom was flourishing still stands at the centre of his palace. The tree, according to historical evidence, is believed to be over 500 years. In those days the city was {{in the form of a}} stratified society. There were sections of the city made for the ruling class, and there were areas made for the spiritual class like the Islamic scholars and traditional spiritual leaders. The residences of these classes of people were situated around the king’s palace. They were usually consulted by the king on spiritual matters and they often assisted in foreseeing the plots of enemies against the kingdom before they were hatched. Before the kingdom embarked on warfare the spiritualists were often consulted to determine the outcome. There were also areas for the kingdom’s army. The military were normally quartered around the outer part of the city in case of external aggression. Interestingly, there are still features at the site to confirm all these historical claims about the city.The ancient city stone architecture is unique. It was believed that Surame and its associated site at Gungu are the largest stone cities in Africa with great potentials in archeological value. The two cities are regarded as stone cities because their entire landscape is stone rich in iron content. It is being speculated that Kanta possibly situated his kingdom at Surame, because of the iron materials he needed to make weapons to execute his war of conquest. At Surame, there are many other features like the graves where ruling class personalities and commoners were buried. There are also wells that used to supply water to the city and the king’s palace. Due to neglect of several years these wells had been filled with sediments. Also, there are watchtowers and security outposts. There is also a particular spot called ‘Heavenly Bridge’ at the site (Wuta- Da- Aljanah). It was said to be the place where evil doers or those who committed offences in the city in those days, were tried and punished. Offenders were usually thrown into a fire prepared to burn for 24 hours in a ditch. The other side of it was where the king was said to have prepared to honour good people in the kingdom. However, due to internal and external wrangling at Surame after the death of Kanta, the Kabawa left the city in 17th century and settled in Birnin Kebbi. After 100 years, they left and settled at Argungu in 1831 under their first ruler, Ismaila Nabame. In 1991 Dr Leseigang and Gerhard carried out archeological research at the site of the ancient kingdom. It was discovered that three civilizations had lived at Surame before Kanta arrived there.In the 1950s, the then Sokoto Native Authority declared it a reserved forest. In 1964 the Federal Government declared it a national monument. After a careful study carried out at the site where the Kabawa of Argungu once lived, the National Commission for Museum and Monuments (NCMM) in 2009 decided to prepare it for enlistment in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Malam Garba Hassan Mahadi who is the Site Manager of Surame city and Curator of Kanta National Museum in Argungu, Kebbi State spoke on the efforts by NCMM and other institutions to ensure the site is listed in the UNESCO World Heritage list. “Yusuf Abdallah Usman, Director General of the National Commission for Museum and Monuments (NCMM) has done a lot on this. We have carried out some researches on the archeological value of the stone city walls and the floral value of its landscape. At various times archaeological discoveries were made at Surame. In 2012 the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria carried out excavation work to determine whether the city walls were built within one period. It was discovered they were done in phases between 16th-17th centuries. NCMM also carried out excavation work at the king’s palace and a feature believed to be a furnace was discovered. “The Department of Biological Science of the Usman Dan Fodio University in Sokoto has also carried out research work at the site to ascertain its floral value. They discovered 56 angio Sperms species of plants that are highly medicinal at the site. One of them, Geza is said to be good for the treatment of childlessness in women. The commission has also embarked on a five year management plan of the site. We are to design the heritage trail - the routes that will lead tourists to the features at the site. We will also create fatigue breakers- (resting places), visitors orientation centre, car park and refreshment centre. Until we have done these we cannot package Surame city for the UNESCO Tentative list. The NCMM has done a great job in terms of archaeological excavation, field research, stone conservation and documentation, but more still needs to be done. Kebbi and Sokoto State governments must partner with the NCMM to actualize this effort of listing it in the World Heritage site. The beneficiaries of the site are Kebbi and Sokoto states. Kebbi holds the intangible, while Sokoto holds the tangible heritage of Surame city. If they come together we can get the site listed in the UNESCO list within one or two years. “Surame site is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. It would bring a lot of revenue to government, especially now that our oil revenue has fallen. If the site is well packaged it will be a great source of revenue. There are only two World heritage sites in Nigeria, Osun Oshogbo and Sukur cultural landscape in Adamawa State.

40|$|Fault {{tree and}} digraph models are {{frequently}} used for system failure analysis. Both type of models represent a failure space {{view of the}} system using AND and OR nodes in a directed graph structure. Fault trees must have a tree structure and do not allow cycles or loops in the graph. Digraphs allow any pattern of interconnection between loops in the graphs. A common operation performed on digraph and fault tree models is the calculation of minimal cut sets. A cut set {{is a set of}} basic failures that could cause a given target failure event to occur. A minimal cut set for a target event node in a fault tree or digraph is any cut set for the node with the property that if any one of the failures in the set is removed, the occurrence of the other failures in the set will not cause the target failure event. CUTSETS will identify all the minimal cut sets for a given node. The CUTSETS package contains programs that solve for minimal cut sets of fault trees and digraphs using object-oriented programming techniques. These cut set codes can be used to solve graph models for reliability analysis and identify potential single point failures in a modeled system. The fault tree minimal cut set code reads in a fault tree model input file with each node listed in a text format. In the input file the user specifies a top node of the fault tree and a maximum cut set size to be calculated. CUTSETS will find minimal sets of basic events which would cause the failure at the output of a given fault <b>tree</b> <b>gate.</b> The program can find all the minimal cut sets of a node, or minimal cut sets up to a specified size. The algorithm performs a recursive top down parse of the fault tree, starting at the specified top node, and combines the cut sets of each child node into sets of basic event failures that would cause the failure event at the output of that gate. Minimal cut set solutions can be found for all nodes in the fault tree or just for the top node. The digraph cut set code uses the same techniques as the fault tree cut set code, except it includes all upstream digraph nodes in the cut sets for a given node and checks for cycles in the digraph during the solution process. CUTSETS solves for specified nodes and will not automatically solve for all upstream digraph nodes. The cut sets will be output as a text file. CUTSETS includes a utility program that will convert the popular COD format digraph model description files into text input files suitable for use with the CUTSETS programs. FEAT (MSC- 21873) and FIRM (MSC- 21860) available from COSMIC are examples of programs that produce COD format digraph model description files that may be converted for use with the CUTSETS programs. CUTSETS is written in C-language to be machine independent. It has been successfully implemented on a Sun running SunOS, a DECstation running ULTRIX, a Macintosh running System 7, and a DEC VAX running VMS. The RAM requirement varies with the size of the models. CUTSETS is available in UNIX tar format on a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge (standard distribution) or on a 3. 5 inch diskette. It is also available on a 3. 5 inch Macintosh format diskette or on a 9 -track 1600 BPI magnetic tape in DEC VAX FILES- 11 format.

40|$|Abstract — Traffic {{speed is}} one of the most {{important}} quantities for travel information systems. Accurate speed forecasting can help in trip planning by allowing travelers to avoid the congested routes, either by choosing the alternative routes or by changing the departure time. It is also helpful for traffic monitoring, control, and planning. An important feature of traffic is that it consists of free flow and congested regimes, which have significantly different properties. Training a single traffic speed predictor for both regimes typically results in suboptimal accuracy. To address this problem, a mixture of experts algorithm which consists of two regime-specific linear predictors and a decision <b>tree</b> <b>gating</b> function was developed. A generalized expectation maximization algorithm was used to train the linear predictors and the decision tree. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a 5 -mile stretch of I 35 highway in Minneapolis containing 10 single loop detector stations, with prediction horizons ranging from 5 minutes to one hour ahead. Experimental results showed that mixture of experts approach outperforms several popular benchmark approaches. D I...|$|R
40|$|Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a {{dependability}} analysis {{technique that}} has been widely used to predict reliability, availability and safety of many complex engineering systems. Traditionally, these FTA-based analyses are done using paper-and-pencil proof methods or computer simulations, which cannot ascertain absolute correctness due to their inherent limitations. As a complementary approach, we propose to use the higher-order-logic theorem prover HOL 4 to conduct the FTA-based analysis of safety-critical systems where accuracy of failure analysis is a dire need. In particular, the paper presents a higher-order-logic formalization of generic Fault <b>Tree</b> <b>gates,</b> i. e., AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and NOT and the formal verification of their failure probability expressions.

50|$|Mitchell Playground {{was both}} {{the first public}} {{playground}} in Charleston {{as well as in}} South Carolina. The park served the upper wards of Charleston predominantly, but it was convenient to the main trolley lines too. The park was a turf field surrounded by a hedge and shade <b>trees</b> with <b>gates</b> into the playground at each corner. Paths crossed diagonally through the park. Equipment included swings, monkey bars, and joggling boards. The playground had live tennis courts, a basketball court, a football field, and other amenities.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} reducing the power consumption of a synchronous digital system by minimizing the total power {{consumed by the}} clock signals. We construct activity-driven clock trees wherein sections of the clock tree are turned off by gating the clock signals. Since gating the clock signal implies that additional control signals and gates are needed, there exists a tradeoff {{between the amount of}} clock <b>tree</b> <b>gating</b> and the total power consumption of the clock tree. We exploit similarities in the switching activity of the clocked modules {{to reduce the number of}} clock gates. Assuming a given switching activity of the modules, we propose three novel activity-driven problems: a clock tree construction problem, a clock gate insertion problem, and a zero-skew clock gate insertion problem. The objective of these problems is to minimize system's power consumption by constructing an activity-driven clock tree. We propose an approximation algorithm based on recursive matching to solve the clock tree construction problem. We also propose an exact algorithm employing the dynamic programming paradigm to solve the gate insertion problems. Finally, we present experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our approach. This paper is a step in understanding how high-level decisions (e. g., behavioral design) can affect a low-level design (e. g., clock design) ...|$|R
