5|$|In 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Docks</b> {{directly}} employed 23 full-time employees, {{but this}} does not include people working as crews on the dredging vessels or pilots based at Barry. <b>The</b> <b>docks</b> had 114 tenants in 2003, which had fallen to 103 tenants in 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>docks</b> {{occupy the}} former sound between Barry Island and the mainland. The {{contractors}} built dams to connect {{each end of}} the island to the mainland, drained or pumped the water from the site and excavated it. They used the material to level the area round <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> and for the core of breakwaters to protect the entrance. The works included a basin with gates at each end which served as a lock between the sea entrance and <b>the</b> <b>docks,</b> the dock walls and quays, coal loading equipment and railways to deliver coal from the mines to <b>the</b> <b>docks.</b> A second dock and second entrance lock were added in 1898. Barry Dock Offices were built in 1897-1900 by the architect Arthur E. Bell.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{start of}} a {{demographic}} shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> moved into storage and freight. The downward shift continued into the 20th century as the local population's dependency on <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> continued: as <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> sheds {{were used}} for grain storage and then for {{imported}} livestock. In 1890, a pumping station was installed on the river wall adjoining to <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> This slowly silted <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and by <b>the</b> 1960s <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> had silted up, leaving <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> derelict by 1992.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{closed in}} 1968, part of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> still exists, {{but without a}} lock {{connection}} to Humber Dock; the Princes Quay shopping centre opened in 1991 was built over part of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> on stilts, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> now features a fountain.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{opened in}} 1880 {{and was named}} William Wright <b>Dock</b> after <b>the</b> Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Dock</b> Company. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was 5.75 acre in size.|$|R
5|$|A further {{expansion}} to <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> {{were completed}} in 1914.|$|E
5|$|A ring of barrage {{balloons}} protected <b>the</b> <b>docks.</b> One {{was located}} on the mole and another beside the Barry Island Station.|$|E
5|$|At first, <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> {{were only}} {{accessible}} via the Basin {{for a few}} hours during high water.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{was called}} <b>The</b> <b>Dock</b> until <b>the</b> {{construction}} of further docks, whence {{it was called}} <b>The</b> Old <b>Dock,</b> it was officially named <b>the</b> Queen's <b>Dock</b> in 1855.|$|R
50|$|Defendant Lake Erie was at <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> of {{plaintiff}} Vincent {{to unload}} cargo from Reynolds, the steamship {{owned by the}} defendant. An unusually violent storm developed. Lake Erie was unable to leave <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> safely and deckhands for the steamship instead tied the Reynolds to <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> continually changing ropes {{as they began to}} wear and break. A sudden fierce wind threw the ship against <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> significantly damaging <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was in use until 1975 {{when the}} fishing {{industry}} was moved to Albert Dock at which point <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> closed. Partial filling in of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> began in <b>the</b> 1980s. The western part has been redeveloped into the St Andrews Quay retail park while {{the eastern part of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> around <b>the</b> entrance was declared a conservation area in 1990 due to its social historic interest. [...] <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> entrance, and some shipping company buildings remain in situ, but the remains of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> are completely silted up.|$|R
5|$|Bute {{responded by}} putting {{commercial}} pressure on shipping companies {{to abandon the}} Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their wharfs to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> brought in a gross income of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared {{to the size of}} the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> were {{no longer}} used to export coal, {{although}} there was some traffic in coke.|$|E
5|$|Deptford's {{population}} has been mainly associated with <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> since {{the establishment of the}} Royal Docks by Henry VIII, though there has also been some market gardening and potteries. When <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected.|$|E
5000|$|The tail of {{the horse}} and other equines {{consists}} of two parts, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and <b>the</b> skirt. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> consists of <b>the</b> muscles and skin covering the coccygeal vertebrae. The term [...] "skirt" [...] refers to the long hairs that fall below <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> On a horse, long, thick tail hairs begin to grow {{at the base of}} the tail, and grow along the top and sides of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> In donkeys and other members of Equus asinus, as well as some mules, the zebra and the wild Przewalski's horse, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> has short hair at the top of <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> with longer, coarser skirt hairs beginning to grow only toward the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Hair does not grow at all on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{land for}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was {{obtained}} in 1768. Opening in 1773, Duke's Dock was built privately for the Duke of Bridgewater as a Liverpool-based facility for traffic using the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was probably designed by James Brindley, who also built the Bridgewater Canal. The first dockside warehouse on the Mersey was built at <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> in 1783, and <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was extended in the 1790s due to {{growth in the}} cotton industry. In 1811, a large six-storey warehouse {{was built on the}} southern side of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Barges were able to enter the warehouse from <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and <b>the</b> building lasted until the 1960s. In 1845, a small half-tide dock was constructed between Duke's <b>Dock</b> and <b>the</b> river and, {{at the opposite end of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> Wapping Basin was added in 1855. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was purchased by the MD&HB in 1900, and the warehouses remained until 1960. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> had a southern branch which was filled in 1967, and warehouses were removed from the north and south quaysides. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> closed in 1972.|$|R
50|$|A tunnel {{from the}} Garston and Liverpool Railway emerged at <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and <b>the</b> second Herculaneum <b>Dock</b> railway station of the Liverpool Overhead Railway was {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> from 1896. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was further improved in 1898, by widening the entrances and deepening <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Harrington Dock {{was used by}} the Elder Dempster Lines and its associated businesses.|$|R
5|$|Houses {{were built}} for the {{construction}} workers {{that would be used}} by the dock workers after <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> had been opened.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, {{the railway}} network came to Milford, linking {{it to the}} Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was {{completed}} on an additional extension which provided access to <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> and ship-breaking yard {{on the eastern side}} of the town. Between 1875 and 1886 The Great Eastern was a permanent fixture at Milford Docks, remaining there for lengthy repairs. Her arrival into <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> was heralded as an example of the scale of vessel which the town could expect to attract.|$|E
5|$|It {{included}} a temporary stone dam where {{the entrance to}} <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> would be built.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Railway <b>Dock</b> was {{connected}} {{on the west}} side of Humber <b>Dock</b> to <b>the</b> north of Kingston Street, and was smaller than <b>the</b> other town <b>docks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> of 13130 sq ft, approximately 716 by 165 ft was constructed at a cost of £106,000. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> opened 3 December 1846. <b>The</b> <b>Dock</b> Company's engineer was J.B Hartley, also engineer on <b>the</b> east <b>dock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{major feature}} of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> today is London City Airport, whose single runway has been {{constructed}} {{the length of}} the south side of <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> forming <b>the</b> northern boundary of the airport. <b>The</b> filled dry <b>docks</b> and ship repair works site lie under the runway. Aircraft movements are clearly visible across <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> from <b>the</b> largely accessible north quayside.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{consists}} of a rock-walled marina with an opening for boats. The bridge is normally closed, allowing pedestrian access around <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> is normally used by motor pleasure boats, yachts, and fishing boats serving the city's fish market and restaurants, several of which are at {{the northern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|R

50|$|A kayaker {{performs}} a bow stall while their hands {{are on a}} dock. Then, pushing on <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>the</b> kayaking creates momentum to propel themselves upwards {{and out of the}} water to get on <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> best {{way to do this is}} to twist your body and jump towards <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> kayaker thens ends up sitting flat on <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> main purpose of this is to easily remove the kayaker from the water.|$|R
50|$|Between 1844 and 1921, the Ordnance Datum for the British Isles {{was taken}} from the level of <b>the</b> Victoria <b>Dock.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was altered in 1848. By 1858, the largest share of <b>the</b> <b>dock's</b> trade was with America. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was unmodernised until 1929.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> at Exmouth {{could take}} vessels up to 750 tons; most traffic was inwards, but {{outwards}} traffic included herrings for London. Wagons for <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> were propelled {{as there was}} no run-round facility there. Formal termination {{of the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> took place in December 1967; <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> itself continued in use until December 1990.|$|R
5|$|The Geest company used <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> {{to import}} West Indian bananas from 1959 until the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The US Army built a large camp in {{the spring}} of 1942 to house troops that {{serviced}} <b>the</b> <b>docks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Victorian era saw further {{expansion}} of the city, both in its industrial heartland around <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> and in the suburbs, particularly in Clifton.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, most of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> basin {{was used as}} a {{designated}} landfill site.

40|$|Existing {{self-reconfigurable}} robots achieve {{connections and}} disconnections by a separate drive of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system. In this paper, {{we present a}} new docking system with which the connections and disconnections are driven by locomotion actuators, {{without the need for}} a separate drive, which reduces the weight and the complexity of the modules. This self-reconfigurable robot consists of two types of fundamental modules, i. e., active and passive modules. By <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system, two types of connections are formed with the fundamental modules, and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> and undocking actions are achieved through simple control with less sensory feedback. This paper describes the design of the robotic modules, <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system, <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> process, and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> force analysis. An experiment is performed to demonstrate the self-reconfigurable robot with <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> is 1,139 ft long, with a {{width of}} 147 ft. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> is 45 ft deep at spring tide.
