5|$|It is {{told that}} an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta {{used to watch}} over his father's herd of alpaca {{on the slopes of}} the mountain. He wandered into the snowfields of the glacier, where he {{encountered}} a mestizo boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. He was surprised to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E

Shiva tried to reason with the boy saying that he was Parvati's husband but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> not listen and was {{determined}} to not let Shiva enter till his mother Goddess Parvati finished her bath. The boy's behaviour surprised Shiva. Sensing that this was no ordinary boy, the usually peaceful Shiva decided he would have to fight the boy and in his divine fury severed the boy's head with his Trishul thereby killing him instantly.|$|E

The men who were killed were members of the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) which was working in support of the company operation. The members of the QRF were talking to locals when a 13-year-old boy pushed a wheelbarrow containing an explosive device toward them, which was then detonated killing the marines and killing and injuring a number of children and civilians. It is thought that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> not know about the explosives in the wheelbarrow and was an unsuspecting victim of the blast.|$|E

25|$|As a result, Cao Cao ordered Zuo Ci to be executed, but Zuo had disappeared. Cao Cao {{sent his}} general Xu Chu to capture Zuo Ci, Xu saw Zuo walking among {{a flock of}} sheep and slew the flock, {{thinking}} Zuo had become a sheep; when Xu had left the shepherd boy who had been tending the flock heard one of the sheep's heads telling him to place the heads next to the bodies {{to bring them back}} to life, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> this and the sheep returned to life. After Xu Chu failed to capture Zuo Ci, Cao Cao put out posters calling for Zuo Ci's capture, and as a result hundreds of men matching the exact description of Zuo were found, and Cao ordered them all executed. When they were all executed black vapor rose from their necks where they joined to form another image of Zuo Ci. The image summoned a crane for him to sit on, and Cao Cao had archers to shoot him down. Suddenly, a gust of wind brought the decapitated corpses back to life. The reanimated corpses carried their heads and started to beat Cao Cao. Cao Cao fainted due to shock, the winds died down, and Zuo Ci disappeared along with the corpses.|$|E
500|$|In about 1756–57 William Kent, a usurer from Norfolk, married Elizabeth Lynes, the {{daughter}} of a grocer from Lyneham. [...] They moved to Stoke Ferry where Kent kept an inn and later, the local post office. [...] They were apparently very much in love, but their marriage was short-lived as within a month of the move Elizabeth died during childbirth. [...] Her sister Frances—commonly known as Fanny—had during Elizabeth's pregnancy moved in with the couple and she stayed to care for the infant and its father. [...] <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> not survive long and rather than leave, Fanny stayed on to take care of William and the house. [...] The two soon began a relationship, but canon law appeared to rule out marriage; when Kent travelled to London to seek advice he was told that as Elizabeth had borne him a living son, a union with Fanny was impossible. [...] In January 1759 therefore, he gave up the post office, left Fanny and moved to London, intending to [...] "purchase a place in some public office" [...] in the hope that [...] "business would erase that passion he had unfortunately indulged". [...] Fanny meanwhile stayed with one of her brothers at Lyneham.|$|E
500|$|During {{these few}} years at Riebeek West Jan worked assiduously at his studies — self-evidently, given his achievements. His {{academic}} abilities were soon noted by his headmaster, {{who went out}} of his way to provide Jan with further curricular reading. Yet this was to prove insufficient to meet what was becoming an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge. Jan borrowed books and yet more books from the headmaster, poring over them at all times rather than engaging in the childish pursuits of the other children, separated from them by his strong work ethic. A few weeks before the School Higher examination this had its consequences — Jan fell ill, an illness exacerbated by his unremitting study. With a strict injunction from his doctor, ordering a complete rest with an absolute prohibition on work and reading, Jan was packed off to bed. Nevertheless, despite the doctor's orders, Jan went to strenuous lengths to evade the ban. One story told of him during this enforced convalescence describes how he used to involve the headmaster's youngest son in his subterfuges, bribing the four-year-old child to bring him books from his father's study. This enjoyed considerable success until the day of an unannounced visit from the headmaster's wife. In his sparsely furnished room there were few possibilities, but Jan made the best job that he could of concealing his by now substantial collection of books. The headmaster's wife upon entering the room found Jan, as expected, in bed. However <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> not look to be comfortably resting as he ought, in fact he looked positively uncomfortable. She offered to make Jan's bed for him, he declined, insisting that he was perfectly comfortable; she insisted and, being the headmaster's wife, got her way. Embarking upon her deed of kindness she found, to her astonishment, the real reason for Jan's restlessness — underneath his bedclothes he was making a valiant effort to conceal an immense pile of contraband books! ...|$|E

Faustina probably had another daughter in 151, but the child, Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, {{might not have been}} born until 153. Another son, Tiberius Aelius Antoninus, was born in 152.

2500|$|Immediately after observing Dr. Adams' 12-hour autopsy, Dr. Baden said, [...] "Preliminary {{findings}} indicate <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did</b> not die from sickle cell trait, {{nor did he}} die from natural causes." [...] Dr. Baden has said repeatedly that sickle trait by itself does not cause death. [...] He explained a [...] "sickle cell crisis" [...] is a sickle cell disease—not the same as sickle cell trait. [...] By itself, the sickle cell trait is not harmful. People with sickle cell trait can lead perfectly healthy lives. But beyond that, he said, hospital records indicate Anderson's blood was not sickled until the moment at which he started to die.|$|E

[...] Soon after his birth, his father moved the family to Boston, where he [...] headed a school. The family also spent time at his grandfather's colonial-era house in East Hampton, New York, which was later preserved in honor of Payne. As a youth, Payne showed precocious dramatic talent, but his father tried to discourage that path.

2500|$|In 1834, {{at the age}} of 14, Alexey's {{father took}} him to Kostroma, to enroll him in the local gymnasium. Memories of his school life found their way into the short story [...] "The Old Man" [...] and the novel Men of the Forties. [...] "I started well, was {{perceptive}} and hard-working, but gained most of my popularity as an amateur actor," [...] he later remembered. Inspired by The Dnieper Mermaid (an opera by Ferdinand Kauer), performed by a wandering troupe of actors, Pisemsky, along with his roommate, organized a home theater and had great success with his first role, that of Prudius in The Cossack Poet by Prince Alexander Shakhovskoy. This first triumph had a dramatic effect upon the boy who adopted what he called an [...] "aesthetic way of life", much under the influence of Vsevolod Nikitovich Bartenev, his uncle. Bartenev supplied his nephew with the newest novels and journals and prompted him to begin studying music and playing the piano, which <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>did,</b> according to one of his friends, [...] "with the expressiveness yet unheard of".|$|E
