40|$|Regular {{expression}} matching {{is a key}} task (and often computational bottleneck) in {{a variety}} of software tools and applications. For instance, the standard grep and sed utilities, scripting languages such as perl, internet traffic analysis, XML querying, and protein searching. The basic definition of a regular expression is that we combine characters with union, concatenation, and kleene star operators. The length m is proportional to the number of characters. However, often the initial operation is <b>to</b> <b>concatenate</b> <b>characters</b> in fairly long strings, e. g., if we search for certain combinations of words in a firewall. As a result, the number k of strings in the regular expression is significantly smaller than m. Our main result is a new algorithm that essentially replaces m with k in the complexity bounds for regular expression matching. More precisely, after an O(m log k) time and O(m) space preprocessing of the expression, we can match it in a string presented as a stream log w of characters in O(k w + log k) time per character, where w is the number of bits in a memory word. For large w, this corresponds to the previous best bound log w of O(m w + log m). Prior to this work no O(k) bound per character was known. We further extend our solution to efficiently handle character class interval operators C{x, y}. Here, C is a set of characters and C{x, y}, where x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x ≤ y, represents a string of length between x and y from C. These character class intervals generalize variable length gaps which are frequently used for pattern matching in computational biology applications. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In this research, {{the concept}} of {{piggybacking}} has been extended <b>to</b> <b>concatenate</b> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. In any given network scenario, voice (UDP) is given priority over data (TCP) packet. During high traffic load, a UDP packet is processed at a higher priority, thus accumulating the TCP packets and leading to congestion and retransmission of TCP packets. Because {{it is challenging to}} integrate UDP and TCP packets an efficient queuing model has been proposed <b>to</b> <b>concatenate</b> the packets without causing a negative impact on UDP or voice traffic. In this paper, we propose the algorithm and model <b>to</b> <b>concatenate</b> UDP and TCP packets into a single packet and obtain better throughput for TCP traffic, efficient utilization of network bandwidth. The concatenation is performed based on parameters such as priority, destination and MTU size. The concept of discrete-time Markov chain has been leveraged to analyze the router utilization and efficiently handle the concatenated packets. The PCATTCP tool has been used to study the performances of UDP and TCP packets traversing a LAN between two end hosts. These values have been used for the simulation of the problem. Discrete Event Simulation has also been performed to determine the optimal values and associated system parameters...|$|R
