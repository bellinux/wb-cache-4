50|$|For self-protection, {{the carrier}} is {{armed with a}} NSV heavy machine gun mounted {{on top of the}} driver cabin. This however {{provides}} the gunner only a limited <b>traverse</b> <b>angle</b> so that the vehicle ideally has to face the threat.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} with World War I-era guns, the M1931 had split trail carriage, allowing for much wider <b>traverse</b> <b>angle.</b> The carriage was fitted with {{leaf spring suspension}} and ten-spoke metal wheels with solid rubber tires. Some late production pieces had ML-20-type wheels with pneumatic tires. The carriage also featured spring-type equlibrator. The shield gave the crew some protection from small arms and shell fragments.|$|E
50|$|However the {{modernization}} {{did not address}} the low mobility and small <b>traverse</b> <b>angle</b> of the gun due to its remaining single trail carriage without suspension. Maximal, horse-drawn, transport speed was only 6-7 km/h. This limited the anti-tank effectiveness of the M1902/30 and essentially rendered the gun obsolete in swift and maneuver warfare, so it was phased out of production in 1937 when the new divisional gun, the F-22, was adopted.|$|E
50|$|Since by the {{definition}} of the quadratrix the <b>traversed</b> <b>angle</b> is proportional to the traversed segment of the associated squares' side dividing that segment on the side into n equal parts yields a partition of the associated angle as well.

50|$|The M1931 {{was one of}} {{the first}} Soviet {{artillery}} pieces to feature split trail carriage. This carriage construction allowed for much better <b>traverse</b> <b>angles</b> compared to earlier single trail or box trail carriages. Good elevation angle and ability to use different propellant charges made the gun flexible indirect fire weapon, and its ballistics were powerful enough to make it useful in direct fire role against enemy armor (though, as mentioned above, it was not an ideal anti-tank gun because of its size, traverse speed and rate of fire).|$|R

Those pieces, developed before World War I, had unsprung fixed trail carriages and short barrels, which meant poor mobility, insufficient elevation and <b>traverse</b> <b>angles</b> and short range. Although both pieces were eventually modernized, resulting in the 152-mm howitzer M1909/30 and the 152-mm howitzer M1910/37 respectively, these were relatively minor upgrades which brought only limited improvement in some areas and didn't address others. It was clear that a completely new design was needed. However, at that time Soviets had little experience in developing modern artillery pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Buffington and Crozier further refined {{the concept}} {{in the late}} 1880s by {{allowing}} the counterweight fulcrum to slide, giving the gun a more elliptical recoil path. The Buffington-Crozier Disappearing Carriage (1893) represented the zenith of disappearing gun carriages, and guns of up to 16-inch size were eventually mounted on such carriages. Disappearing guns were highly popular {{for a while in}} the British Empire, the United States and other countries. In the United States, they were the primary armament of the Endicott- and Taft-era fortifications, constructed 1898-1917. Simpler carriages with a limited disappearing function were initially provided for smaller weapons, the balanced pillar for the 5-inch gun M1897 and the Driggs-Seabury masking parapet for the manufacturer's 3-inch gun M1898. However, these could only be retracted at a limited <b>traverse</b> <b>angle,</b> thus could not be used in action, and were disabled during World War I in the [...] "up" [...] position, with new installations receiving pedestal mounts. Both carriage types and their associated guns were removed from service in the 1920s.|$|E

The Maybach HL-120TRM, having been successful during the ongoing Second World War, was selected as the engine for this new project, and was connected to the SSG-77 transmission. The most striking change was the use of a box drive with large wheels, with a hydraulic pivoting device tower. The vehicle was designed to be equipped with 50mm armour all-round, with 60mm thick armor plates on the front part of the body having a 60 degree vertical inclination on the top and 45 degrees vertical inclination at the bottom. Driving wheels of the PzKpfw III were used with the addition of reinforced output shafts, along with 540mm wide symmetrical tracks with a central ridge. The chassis had six semi-detached rollers 660mm in diameter on the leaf springs. The turret used was a modified variant of the PzKpfw IV Ausf. J, and used flexible electrical cable instead of using rotary electrical contacts at the base. The <b>traverse</b> <b>angle</b> of the turret was limited to 270 left and right longitudinally.|$|E

The vortex core traverses {{were conducted by}} the NRC T- 33 and were all initiated in-trail, with the T- 33 flight-path being parallel to the vortex core axis generally vortex core entries {{were made in the}} vortex core six o-clock position. Core traverses took 3 / 4 to 11 / 4 seconds, over which the T- 33 flew along the vortex axis a distance of 200 - 300 metres, and 4 - 20 m across the cores, amounting to traverse angles of 2 - 40 The vortex core profile symmetry and/or constancy over such a small <b>traverse</b> <b>angle</b> was ascertained, by comparing the advancing and retreating segments (to the closest point-of-approach, CPA) of the profiles. Often the implied symmetry/constancy was good, sometimes it wasn't small, very energetic secondary and tertiary vortex segments were encountered only to or from the CPA, on either the advancing or retreating segment only. In particular, they made identification of vortex core funnel segments difficult. In 2011, yaw traverses of vortex cores were conducted, entering the cores at angles of yaw to the vortex axial direction, of 15300 and/or angles of pitch of c. 50 so that the cores were traversed over much smaller axial distances than intrail traverses.

5000|$|The main {{differences}} between the SU-152G and the ISU-152 {{as well as its}} variants, and that between it and 2S3 made it {{what appeared to be a}} middle ground between these two self-propelled guns. The ISU-152 was intended to be a heavy assault gun from the beginning, which required capability of direct firing, and a weak transition towards firing from closed positions began. In addition, the crew of the vehicles were often poisoned by the exhaust gases after firing in closed combat compartments. Despite the overt advantage of the SU-152G over the ISU-152 in terms of firing from closed positions, serial production of the SU-152G was never put in effect. All the work on Soviet self-propelled guns were put into a halt in the 1960s and only resumed when the First secretary of the TsK KPSS was removed from position.

40|$|Timescales {{governing}} {{the development of}} crustal magma reservoirs are a key for understanding magmatic processes such as ascent, storage and mixing event. An estimate of these timescales can provide important constraints for volcanic hazard assessment of active volcanoes. We studied the Agnano-Monte Spina eruption (A-MS; 4. 7 ka; VEI = 4; 0. 85 km 3 D. R. E. of magma erupted) of the Campi Flegrei caldera, {{one of the most}} dangerous volcanic areas on Earth. The A-MS eruption has been fed by magmas varying from more to less evolved trachyte whose variable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and trace elements features suggest magma mixing between two end-members. Ba zonation profiles of alkali feldspar phenocrysts have been determined through combined energy-dispersive and wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe analyses (EDS-WDS-EMPA). We focused on distinct compositional breaks near the rim of the crystals that likely represent the last mixing event prior to eruption. We always chose the steepest gradients close to the crystal rims, taking into account that any effects related to cutting angles or crystal orientation should give longer apparent diffusion times. Two different approaches were undertaken: (1) a quantitative Ba compositional profiles were measured by point analyses along a short transect crossing growth discontinuities and (2) grey-scale profiles were taken parallel to the acquired point profiles. Assuming that Ba dominates the backscattered electron intensities in sanidines, greyscale gradients can be used as a diffusive tracer. BSE images were processed using the ImageJ® software, in order to extract a numerical greyscale profile. In both cases, each profile was interpolated through a non-linear Boltzmann fit curve with the Mathematica® software. A few traverses done at angles smaller than 90 ° to the compositional boundary interface were corrected by multiplying the distance values by the sinus of the <b>traverse</b> <b>angle</b> relative to the vertical on the interface. Our preliminary estimates gave diffusion times from quantitative point analyses between 100 ’s up to 4000 years at 900 °C. At higher T (950 °C) these values reduce to a range from a few years to 600 yrs. Grey-scale profiles gave diffusion times of 400 yrs (900 °C) and between 60 and 70 yrs (950 °C). This comparison and the uncertainty in T values indicate that further work needs to be done to better constrain diffusion times. In the future we will use accumulated back-scatter images for higher greyscale (i. e. mass) resolution and X-ray cps profiles on Ba for a systematic comparison of these different approaches. In any case, it appears that short times scales down to years and decades since mixing and coalescence of distinct magma batches in the reservoir, is consistent with our data. Such timescales might represent the time required for the A-MS magma to collect from different magma batches into a reservoir of eruptible magma before eruption. From a volcanological and geochronological point of view, a centuries to decades timescale is in reasonable agreement with the reconstructed volcanic history preceding the A-MS eruption...|$|E

This was the motivation to investigate methods and techniques for crevasse detection with the future aim to establish a „secure navigation system “ for mountain tourists. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a promising tool {{for the detection of}} snow covered crevasses, since the transition from snow to ice can easily be detected due to the change of several material parameters, like density, water content and most important the dielectricity. The feasibility and reliability of GPR crevasse detection was investigated by a field study. During the summer season a number of open crevasses were surveyed by differential GPS. In late winter a thick snow cover obscured these “test crevasses ” and provided a secure crossing. The surveyed crevasses were marked on the snow surface and afterwards crossed by GPR in different directions. A regular profiling was carried out, as well as crossings in different <b>traversing</b> <b>angles.</b> After the usual processing steps to synchronize and enhance the reflected signals, the anomalies in case of an occurring crevasse can be seen clearly:- the reflection horizon from the snow/ice boundary is non continuous- internal snow layers above a detected crevasse show curvatures towards the crevasse- diffraction from the walls of the crevasse appear as hyperbolas The results from the combined application of GPR and GPS suggest that a system for safe glacier travel on alpine glaciers could be developed, based on clear crevasse detection combined with high accuracy positioning.

40|$|Forty {{years have}} passed since the {{discovery}} of pulsars, yet the physical mechanism of their coherent radio emission is a mystery. Recent observational and theoretical studies strongly suggest that the radiation outcoming from the pulsar magnetosphere consists mainly of extraordinary waves polarized perpendicular to the planes of pulsar dipolar magnetic field. However, the fundamental question whether these waves are excited by maser or coherent curvature radiation, remains open. High quality single pulse polarimetry is required to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms. Here we showcase such decisive strong single pulses from 10 pulsars observed with the GMRT, showing extremely high linear polarization with the position angle following locally the mean position <b>angle</b> <b>traverse.</b> These pulses, which are relatively free from depolarization, must consist of exclusively single polarization mode.

We have simulated a set of typical pulse profiles, and analyzed the role of viewing geometry, rotation and modulation on the pulsar polarization profiles.
