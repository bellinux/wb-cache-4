500|$|Although the {{original}} referendum for a one-cent transit sales tax increase had failed in 1999, a half-cent sales surtax (Charter County Transit System Surtax) increase {{was passed by}} a two-to-one margin by Miami-Dade County voters in November 2002, with the intention being for the revenue to go fully towards the funding of new transit lines, including the Metrorail Orange Line, new bus routes, and increased service. Metrorail briefly ran a 24-hour hourly service from 12am to 5am and rush hour peak headways were reduced to 6 minutes, {{but the idea of}} the <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> was sold to voters as being able to fund up to [...] of additional Metrorail track by the 2030 long range plan, beginning with a completion of an Orange Line north corridor and east–west line by 2016. As it turned out, Miami-Dade Transit was running a deficit and used some of the tax to close the books, as well as using some to hire new staff, pay rent, and buy furniture for their new headquarters at Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre Station. [...] By the late 2000s recession, it was realized that only the [...] AirportLink of the Orange Line would be funded, and after service cuts in 2008, Metrorail was running fewer trains than before the tax was passed. In response to all this, The Miami Herald published a comprehensive exposé titled [...] "Taken For A Ride, How the <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> went off track", detailing all of the promises that were not kept as well as what money was misspent and how. Despite the service cuts, due to the rise in energy prices and ever-increasing congestion, as well as a significant amount of residential development in the downtown area, ridership continued to grow during the 2000s, averaging well over 60,000 weekday riders throughout 2011. However, this is still short of the 1985 estimate of 75,000 daily riders that were expected {{by the end of that}} year. The <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> also funded improvements to the adjoining Metromover system, including removal of the 25 cent fare, with the idea that higher ridership on the system would lead to higher Metrorail ridership, as well as the realization that the cost of fare collection exceeded fare revenue.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} the half-penny <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> was passed in 2002 that any serious {{expansion}} plans were again considered, with the North Corridor and East–West lines, both dubbed the [...] "Orange Line," [...] assuming the highest priority, while the possibility of [...] of additional rail if all the extensions were built by 2030, was touted. However, after budget deficits, other uses of the tax revenue, and a downgrade of the North Corridor's funding priority to medium-low by the federal government, after 10 years only the 2.4 mile AirportLink and Orange Line remained promised and realized.|$|E

2500|$|The half penny <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> {{approved}} in November 2002 {{as part of}} the People's Transportation Plan was promised to fund at least the Metrorail Orange Line expansions in the short term, with a long term promise to build nearly [...] of track and 50 stations for Metrorail, among other things. The plan stated that no more than five percent of tax proceeds would go to administration costs. Not only was the money used for other things, it was later revealed by the federal government that Miami-Dade Transit could not actually afford to support and operate these lines even if their construction was 100% federally funded, as MDT's revenue and ridership forecasts assumed significant and regular increases in fare while assuming no loss in ridership. This, along with a more recent federal investigation and takeover in 2011 has led to Miami-Dade Transit's perception as an accountable organization.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th Century, travel between New York and Philadelphia, then America's two largest cities, was {{difficult}} and expensive. In 1800, a trip {{between the two}} cities could {{take as long as}} eleven hours on a good day and as long as twenty on a bad one. In 1829, eager to reduce the cost and difficulty of travel, began investigating a cross-state canal and railroads. Railroads had already met with success in Britain and several American cities were planning lines of their own. The legislature, amid very aggressive lobbying, decided to build both a canal and a railroad. The canal and the railroad were to be built parallel to each other and controlled by separate companies chartered by the legislature. Each corporation was to give the state $100,000 worth of stock and pay a <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> levied on cargo and each passenger carried. The corporation chartered to build the canal complicated this arrangement by deciding to also build a railroad. The legislature responded with a so-called [...] "Marriage Act" [...] to combine the two companies.|$|E

The group working to repeal the <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> saw far less support (under $13,000) mostly from individuals.

In response to these concerns, a coalition labeling itself Stop the Train launched a petition drive to put a repeal of the 1998 <b>transit</b> <b>tax</b> on the November 2007 ballot, citing cost-overruns and concerns over CATS management.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of tolling road use on a {{parallel}} network when different governments have tolling authority on the different links of the network. The paper analyses the tax competition between countries that each maximise the surplus of local users plus tax revenues. Three types of tolling systems are considered: (i) toll discrimination between local and transit traffic, (ii) uniform tolls on local and transit traffic, (iii) only local tolls can be imposed. The paper characterises the optimal toll levels chosen in a Nash equilibrium for the three tolling systems. The numerical illustration shows that introducing <b>transit</b> <b>taxes</b> generates large welfare effects and that toll systems that only apply to local users only generate a low welfare gain. Nash equilibrium toll discrimination between local and transit traffic generates slightly higher welfare than the solution where both tolls have to be uniform...|$|R
