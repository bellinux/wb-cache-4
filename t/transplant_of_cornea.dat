40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} Fourier-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (FD-OCT) as {{an adjunct}} to traditional slit lamp examination <b>of</b> donor <b>corneas</b> with suspected Anterior Stromal Opacities. Methods. Seven <b>corneas</b> suspected <b>of</b> having anterior stromal opacities by slit lamp examination were evaluated with FD-OCT. Each cornea was evaluated to confirm the presence of opacity and, if present, the depth of opacity was measured. Results. The opacity depth ranged from 82 [*]μm to 624 [*]μm. The initial slit lamp impressions of five <b>of</b> the seven <b>corneas</b> were confirmed by OCT. In two corneas, the OCT findings were different from the initial slit lamp impressions. Slit lamp examination <b>of</b> the first <b>cornea</b> gave the impression of anterior stromal scarring, but OCT showed that the opacity was limited to the epithelium. Slit lamp examination <b>of</b> the second <b>cornea</b> suggested opacity limited to the epithelium, but OCT identified significant sub-Bowman's scarring. In all cases, the Eye Bank Technicians reported that the location and depth of corneal opacity were more sharply defined by OCT than by slit lamp. Conclusion. The high resolution of OCT makes it easier to determine the location of corneal opacities compared to slit lamp examinations. This enhanced visualization can improve decisions regarding <b>transplant</b> suitability <b>of</b> donor <b>corneas...</b>|$|R
50|$|Transmission {{between humans}} is {{extremely}} rare. A few {{cases have been}} recorded through transplant surgery. The only well-documented cases of rabies caused by human-to-human transmission occurred among eight recipients <b>of</b> <b>transplanted</b> <b>corneas</b> and among three recipients of solid organs. In addition to transmission from cornea and organ transplants, bite and non-bite exposures inflicted by infected humans could theoretically transmit rabies, but no such cases have been documented, since infected humans are usually hospitalized and necessary precautions taken. Casual contact, such as touching a person with rabies or contact with non-infectious fluid or tissue (urine, blood, feces) {{does not constitute an}} exposure and does not require post-exposure prophylaxis. Additionally, as the virus is present in sperm or vaginal secretions, spread through sex may be possible.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the effect {{and value of}} amniotic membrane patches and grafts for acute ocular surface burn at different degrees. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 28 cases(28 eyes) affected by ocular chemical or thermal burn with different degree were included in our hospital from March 2007 to March 2012. Amniotic membrane patched was undergone in 13 eyes with fresh amnion that the patients corneal burns degree Ⅱ or Ⅲ with partial limbal buns at degree Ⅳ. Amniotic membrane grafts was performed in 15 eyes with fresh amnion that the patients all corneal burns at degree Ⅲ with the whole limbal necrosis without severe eyelid defect. The follow-up time ranged 6 ～ 24 mo. The postoperative visual acuity, the condition <b>of</b> amniotic membrane <b>transplant,</b> renovation <b>of</b> <b>cornea</b> and complications were observed. RESULTS: Postoperative corrected visual acuity was improved in 20 eyes(71 %), it was not changed in 5 eyes(18 %), the visual acuity declined in 3 eyes(11 %). The amniotic membrane survived in 23 eyes and the survival rate was up to 82 %. The <b>cornea</b> <b>of</b> 4 eyes recovered to transparent, nebula emceed in 8 eyes eventually, corneal macula emerged in 10 eyes, 4 eyes ended up with leukoma, 2 eyes developed corneal melting after therapy, then received lamellar keratoplasty. Corneal surface become epithelization after amnion patches or grafts, but any of them have recurrent epithelial erosion, and become stable epithalization after repeat operation. CONCLUSION: Amniotic membrane patches and grafts is an effective method to deal with acute ocular surface burn...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Keratoconus is a {{relatively}} common disease <b>of</b> <b>cornea</b> in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a conical shape and scar at the central portion <b>of</b> <b>cornea.</b> So far, few methods and drug treatments were introduced due to both lack of accepted animal models to induce experimental keratoconus and limitation of research in human considering ethical issues. In the present study, keratoconus were produced experimentally in mice focusing on collagen regarding histopathological mechanisms. Methods: In this study, collagenase (1, 3 and 6 mg/ml) were injected into the <b>cornea</b> <b>of</b> male mice. Both macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were performed in short periods of one, three and five days after injection. In macroscopic observations, eyes were graded according to the intensity of keratoconus. Microscopic observations consisted <b>of</b> <b>cornea</b> layers evaluations, presence of inflammation, changes <b>of</b> the <b>cornea</b> thickness, epithelium thickness and collagen and stroma changes. Results: Most cornea damage and changes to more conical shape were observed by 6 mg/ml of collagenase. In fact, collagenase at 3 and 6 mg/ml caused deformity and opacity <b>of</b> <b>cornea,</b> dose dependently {{in a manner that}} severe damage to collagen fiber, thinness <b>of</b> <b>cornea</b> and epithelium and cornea rupture, in some cases, were observed at high dose of collagenase...|$|R

RESULTS: The critical contamination periods were found to be before removal, during mortuary washing and during decontamination of the conjunctival cul-de-sac at the removal stage.
