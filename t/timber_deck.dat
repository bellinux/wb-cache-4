5|$|During the Depression, {{the state}} sought to ease {{unemployment}} through {{public works projects}} as an economic stimulus. It applied this to the new Highway 82. First it converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a <b>timber</b> <b>deck,</b> which was then paved and supported with outriggers. In 1937, four miles (6.4km) between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale was paved; {{the remainder of the}} road to Aspen was oiled the following year.|$|E
25|$|Between 1955 and 1959 the <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> of {{the rail}} level was {{replaced}} by steel, and ballasted track was substituted for the earlier waybeam track structure, adding 150 tons of dead load to each span of the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The current {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by the Victorian Railways and the contract let to David Munro & Co in 1886, the four track bridge opening for traffic in 1888. The actual junction of the Port Melbourne and St Kilda lines was at Flinders Street, with the two pairs of tracks running parallel until Clarendon Street, where the St Kilda line diverged south. Constructed at a 33 degree angle to the river bank, {{it was one of}} the first railway structures in Melbourne to use steel girders rather than iron, and the workforce included a young engineering student, John Monash. On either side of the river the steel girders were supported by bluestone and brick buttresses, and on the south side the structure continued as a brickwork viaduct. In the 1920 overhead electrical masts were added as part of the electrification of the line, and the original <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> was replaced with rail and concrete slabs.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> and ramps {{were added}} in Queen's Place for access at the Alice Street end.|$|R
50|$|The ship, {{originally}} named Stina, {{was built}} out of German steel with <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> as a sail powered cargo vessel.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} 80 ft long with a roadway 15.4 ft wide. It had a <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> over {{transverse}} steel I-beam stringers.|$|R
500|$|In 1884 the Board of Works' Chief Engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette {{conducted}} an {{inspection of the}} bridge {{and found that the}} iron rods were already showing serious signs of corrosion. Over the next three years the staying rods were augmented with steel chains, giving it an appearance more closely resembling a conventional suspension bridge, and a new <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> was laid, at a total cost of £25,000 (about £ in [...] ). Despite these improvements, Bazalgette was still concerned about its structural integrity and a weight limit of five tons was imposed on vehicles using the bridge.|$|E
500|$|The Minister for Land and Works had {{approved}} work on raising it in 1939, {{but this was}} postponed indefinitely due to World War II. Raising or renewal of the bridge was again being investigated in 1946. The river again flooded over the bridge in July 1952, {{the first time since}} the mid-1940s, and the <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> was still being repaired into 1953. The last and latest bridge was constructed as part of a bypass of the centre of Hadspen. By 1978, the Bass Highway crossed the river further upstream and the old main road was no longer a through road. This bridge is a [...] long two-lane single-carriageway concrete structure.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating a roadway only [...] wide, {{and with}} serious {{structural}} weaknesses, {{the bridge was}} ill-equipped {{to cope with the}} advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation, the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs, and is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced. The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life, making it the least busy Thames road bridge in London, except for the little-used Southwark Bridge. The bridge's condition is continuing to degrade as the result of traffic load and severe rotting of the <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> structure caused by the urine of the many dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park.|$|E
50|$|North Chapman Road bike trail - NBI Structure Number 7512, {{bridge is}} 103 ft long, stringer/multi-beam or girder, steel, wood or <b>timber</b> <b>decking,</b> built 1991.|$|R
50|$|The Howe truss {{timber bridge}} with <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> spans 155.5 feet, is 22.5 feet high (16.75 inside clearance), and 14 feet wide with cedar {{shingles}} for the exterior.|$|R
50|$|In the UK {{the various}} ban on smoking in public {{buildings}} was expected {{lead to an}} increase in the use of <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> for outdoor spaces where smokers can gather.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>decking</b> {{comes in}} two forms: close boarded and slated. Close boarded decking {{provides}} a solid 'floor' {{to a level}} of racking while slatted is formed by rows of timber and acts as a permanent pallet.|$|R
5000|$|... {{here was}} Holland Road Halt opened 1905 and closed 1956; when closed {{it was the}} only station on the West Coastway line to retain <b>timber</b> <b>decking.</b> This station was sited just west of the Holland Road bridge.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has {{a single}} 34.0 ft span and {{supports}} a 15.7 ft roadway. Its floor is a <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> over I-beam stringers and it is of steel, rigid-connected lattice pony truss construction with latticed guardrails.|$|E
50|$|In fall of 2001, the West Virginia Division of Highways used nearly $400,000 to {{renovate}} the Simpson Creek Covered Bridge. The improvements include a new <b>timber</b> <b>deck,</b> wooden exterior siding and {{a fresh coat of}} paint.|$|E
50|$|It is {{significant}} historically {{as the only}} pinned Parker vehicular truss {{in the state of}} Arizona. At the time of its NRHP listing, in 1988, it was in original condition including having a creosoted <b>timber</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 24 June 1866 {{there was}} a serious fire in a corn mill close to the line on the Newcastle shore. The fire grew and became a total conflagration, and the <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> of the High Level Bridge caught fire. It {{appeared}} this might engulf the entire bridge.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1960s {{the site has}} {{remained}} vacant. A {{large part of the}} <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> from both the upper and middle berths was washed away during the 1974 floods. In early 2000, one of the heritage wharf buildings was demolished after partially collapsing into the Brisbane River.|$|R

50|$|A {{pedestrian}} footbridge (No 1) {{is located}} on the northern boundary of Lissner Park. The footbridge is a simple beam bridge with a pair of steel girders supporting a <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> spanning the 10.2 m wide gap between the two concrete piers on either side of stone pitched drain, with a north-south orientation. A 15 cm thick slab of pre-stressed concrete approximately 1.13 m wide has been laid over the <b>timber</b> <b>deck.</b> Originally Mosman Creek, the drain contains the remains of the original dry stone wall on the northern side, however the southern side has been covered with concrete. There are round steel handrails {{on both sides of the}} footbridge.|$|E
50|$|Between 1955 and 1959 the <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> of {{the rail}} level was {{replaced}} by steel, and ballasted track was substituted for the earlier waybeam track structure, adding 150 tons of dead load to each span of the bridge.|$|E

40|$|Many modern roof {{structures}} {{consist of}} a few widely spaced deep beams bridged by tongue-and-groove <b>timber</b> <b>decking.</b> Deep beams are inherently effi-cient {{in their use of}} material but are subject to the possibility of failure by lateral buckling. It is clear that the shear stiffness of the attached deck contribute...|$|R
25|$|During the war years, {{the road}} to Darwin which would become the Stuart Highway was sealed to cope with an {{increase}} in vehicular movements between military camps in the district. By 1943 over 2000 vehicles were using the road per day. The original rail bridge was upgraded with <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> to allow it to be used by road vehicles as well as trains.|$|R
50|$|The third wharf, {{which is}} the current wharf, was built and {{completed}} in 1956 and was the main wharf for Darwin until the Darwin Port at East Arm was completed in 2000. This wharf was built of steel and concrete with <b>timber</b> <b>decking.</b> The wharf is mainly used as a venue for restaurants and for small boats to tie up alongside.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} is two storey, timber framed with green painted corrugated iron to the hip roof with skillion veranda awnings on three sides. External walls are clad with painted vertical corrugated iron. The former front {{section of the}} <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> veranda has been removed, the lower level open rail balustrade replaced with weatherboards and steps added to access the bar. At the upper level the cross braced open balustrade remains as does the decorative fascia boards. Timber posts support the <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> veranda which provides access to the tongue and groove-lined guest bedrooms through individual French doors. Behind the public bar stands an old hardwood insulated coolroom which is claimed to produce excellent temperature beer.|$|E
50|$|A large {{spread of}} granite chips extends 4 metres from the entrance. Four postholes at the SW {{extremity}} of the granite {{indicate that the}} porch may have extended beyond the main building. Poles probably supported a suspended roof over a raised <b>timber</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "half-hip" [...] pony {{truss bridge}} {{was built in}} 1904 as a {{single-span}} bridge having a 48 ft main span and, with timber stringer approach span having a 79 ft total length. Its roadway was 14.3 ft wide, with <b>timber</b> <b>deck</b> over timber stringers.|$|E
50|$|The jetty {{structure}} {{is made up}} of round timber beams topped with wide <b>timber</b> <b>decking.</b> A raised walkway, which runs along one side of the jetty, has timber handrails along both sides. The remainder of the jetty is used as a driveway for luggage and emergency vehicles meeting the ferry. There is no safety rail along the outer side of the jetty.|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{portable}} bridge {{systems has}} increased in the U. S. due to heightened awareness for reducing environmental impacts and costs associated with road stream crossings.

Specific emphasis is given to quantifying the effects of dynamic loads on portable bridge design...|$|R
50|$|In {{the centre}} of the park is a set of three {{wildlife}} ponds with a <b>timber</b> <b>decking</b> viewing area. This was extensively renovated in 2004, as the two existing ponds were badly overgrown and in decay. This involved the removal of 300 tonnes of sediment, and architects Upton McGougan were awarded runner up in the Sustainable Designer of the Year competition in 2005 for the project.|$|R
