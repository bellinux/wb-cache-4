5|$|Both the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set {{also use}} the <b>trapezoid</b> symbol. The version used by the Church {{includes}} flames, a pitchfork and the number 666, while the <b>trapezoid</b> of the Temple has a left-facing Egyptian sceptre, and the number 666 stylized in geometric shapes rather than as clear numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Fort, {{begun in}} 1903, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Empire. The {{structure}} was a <b>trapezoid,</b> encompassing one infantry rampart, and was equipped with two armored watchtowers, electricity, and ventilation. The walls of its cannon casemates were covered with cork to reduce firing noise. The cost of this single fort was 850,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Hebrew writing yet discovered, {{found at}} Khirbet Qeiyafa, {{dates to the}} 10th century BCE. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) <b>trapezoid</b> pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet). The tablet is written from left to right, indicating that Hebrew writing {{was still in the}} formative stage.|$|E
50|$|Note 1: The most general <b>trapezoids</b> and {{isosceles}} <b>trapezoids</b> do {{not have}} perpendicular diagonals, but there are infinite numbers of (non-similar) <b>trapezoids</b> and isosceles <b>trapezoids</b> that do have perpendicular diagonals and are not any other named quadrilateral.|$|R

5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking {{a piece of the}} maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a <b>trapezoid</b> in shape.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some {{of them were}} already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender <b>trapezoid</b> to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the <b>trapezoid</b> bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
50|$|In some of {{the verses}} before verse 40, Brahmagupta gives constructions of various figures with {{arbitrary}} sides. He essentially manipulated right triangles to produce isosceles triangles, scalene triangles, rectangles, isosceles <b>trapezoids,</b> isosceles <b>trapezoids</b> with three equal sides, and a scalene cyclic quadrilateral.|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in finding an explicit bijection between two families of combinatorial objects: Gog and Magog triangles. These two families are particular classes of Gelfand-Tsetlin triangles and are respectively in bijection with alternating sign matrices (ASM) and totally symmetric self complementary plane partitions (TSSCPP). For this purpose, we introduce left Gog and GOGAm <b>trapezoids.</b> We conjecture that these two families of <b>trapezoids</b> are equienumerated and we give an explicit bijection between the <b>trapezoids</b> {{with one or two}} diagonals.

50|$|In geometry, a prismatoid is a {{polyhedron}} whose vertices all lie in {{two parallel}} planes. Its lateral faces can be <b>trapezoids</b> or triangles. If both planes {{have the same}} number of vertices, and the lateral faces are either parallelograms or <b>trapezoids,</b> it is called a prismoid.|$|R
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down <b>trapezoid</b> {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a <b>trapezoid</b> shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. The chamber was a <b>trapezoid</b> in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E

50|$|We build a {{directed}} acyclic graph, {{where the}} vertices are the <b>trapezoids</b> that existed {{at some point}} in the refinement, and the directed edges connect the <b>trapezoids</b> obtained by subdivision. The expected depth of a search in this digraph, starting from the vertex corresponding to the bounding box, is O(log n).|$|R
5|$|The current IIHF rules differ {{slightly}} from the rules used in the NHL. One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is standard rink dimensions: the NHL rink is narrower, measuring 61m×26m (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft) The larger international size allows for a faster and less physical style of play. Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icing is called. In the NHL, a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) is not behind an attacking player {{in the race to}} the end-zone faceoff dots in his defensive zone, in contrast to the IIHF rules in which play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line. The NHL and IIHF also differ in penalty rules. The NHL calls five-minute major penalties for more dangerous infractions of the rules, such as fighting, in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games. This is in contrast to the IIHF rule, by which players who fight are ejected from the game. Beginning with the 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some were already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and the two-line pass. Others were not picked up by the IIHF, such as those requiring smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender <b>trapezoid</b> to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding, and interference penalties.|$|E

25|$|This may {{be viewed}} as an {{extension}} of the <b>trapezoid</b> rule by the inclusion of correction terms.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{tangential}} quadrilaterals are the kites, {{which include}} the rhombi, which in turn include the squares. The kites are exactly the tangential quadrilaterals that are also orthodiagonal. A right kite is a kite with a circumcircle. If a quadrilateral is both tangential and cyclic, it is called a bicentric quadrilateral, {{and if it is}} both tangential and a <b>trapezoid,</b> it is called a tangential <b>trapezoid.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other {{forms of}} the step cut include {{triangle}} (or Trilliant cut), kite, lozenge, trapeze (or <b>trapezoid),</b> and obus shapes.|$|E
25|$|Every antiparallelogram has an axis of {{symmetry}} {{through its}} crossing point. Because of this symmetry, it has two pairs of equal angles {{as well as two}} pairs of equal sides. Together with the kites and the isosceles trapezoids, antiparallelograms form one of three basic classes of quadrilaterals with a symmetry axis. The convex hull of an antiparallelogram is an isosceles <b>trapezoid,</b> and every antiparallelogram may be formed from the non-parallel sides (or either pair of parallel sides in case of a rectangle) and diagonals of an isosceles <b>trapezoid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flags of}} Japan and Bangladesh {{both have a}} red circle {{in the middle of}} {{different}} colored backgrounds. The flag of the Philippines has a red <b>trapezoid</b> on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red <b>trapezoid</b> is on top and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of Singapore has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the flag of Portugal is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor Republic of Turkey continuing the 1844 Ottoman Flag.|$|E
40|$|A sub-problem of {{the open}} problem of finding an {{explicit}} bijection between alternating sign matrices and totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions consists in finding an explicit bijection between so-called (n, k) Gog <b>trapezoids</b> and (n, k) Magog <b>trapezoids.</b> A quite involved bijection was found by Biane and Cheballah in the case k = 2.
