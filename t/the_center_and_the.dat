5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled and began {{weakening}} {{to the southeast}} of Bermuda on September15, spawning a low-pressure area by September18. A stationary wind circulation developed around the low by September19, aided by a trough aloft to its west. Convection developed into narrow banding features far from <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> overall structure gradually consolidated. It is estimated that the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September20, about 490miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical {{because of the large}} distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on September21, and as such was named Kyle by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of June23, Andres {{weakened}} to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear, decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more stable air mass. The system began to rapidly degenerate, as convection became dislocated from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> overall structure of Andres degraded. By 1200UTC on June24, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100mi (155km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Erika {{continued}} to the west-northwest, {{and in the}} early hours of September 4, an eye-like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially exposed from the convection. Despite unfavorable wind shear, Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530miles (850km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. Deep convection re-developed near <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west-northwestward. Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85miles (135km) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane. An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125mph (205km/h) on September 8, while located about 350miles (565km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24hours before weakening over cooler waters.|$|E

It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about {{the center of the}} image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print.

5|$|It {{continued}} to organize {{throughout the day}} on June21, developing banding features and increased convection. Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres. Upon being named, Andres marked latest date that the first named storm of a season developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July1 of that year. By the morning of June22, very deep thunderstorm activity existed near <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature. Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline. However, strong wind shear, a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones, {{had little effect on}} the developing storm.|$|E

5|$|Later on May 11, {{convection}} re-fired {{over the}} center {{as the system}} drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone. By May 12, shower activity had organized greatly {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression. It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.|$|E
5|$|On May31, Tropical Depression One {{developed}} in the western Caribbean Sea, a day {{before the start of}} the Atlantic hurricane season. The depression moved northeastward, passing just northwest of Isla de la Juventud before striking the Cuban mainland south of Havana. As it crossed the country, its strongest rainfall was east of <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> depression failed to intensify beyond winds of 30mph (45km/h). The National Hurricane Center never expected it to strengthen further, due to unfavorable wind shear. After a hurricane hunters flight could not detect a circulation, The depression degenerated into an open trough east of Florida on June2.|$|E
5|$|On September3, another trough {{exited the}} coast of the United States, {{allowing}} the hurricane to accelerate toward the northeast through the diminished ridge. By that time, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h), although forecasters expected baroclinic instability to maintain much of the cyclone's remaining force. Instead of continued weakening, the hurricane began to significantly re-intensify. Early on September4, Ella again reached major hurricane status, and later that day it peaked with winds of 140mph (220km/h); {{at the time it was}} about 335miles (540km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters. This made it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in Canadian waters. Weakening began immediately after peak intensity due to cooler water temperatures. Early on September5, Ella passed very near Cape Race, although the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Associated convection became completely removed from <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hurricane became extratropical as it was absorbed by a larger mid-latitude system.|$|E

The breakthrough was soon accomplished by attacking the gaps in the Venetian lines, causing disorder among their ranks. The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material was placed in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of}} the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|The Sioux people {{consist of}} three main groups, the Lakota in the west, the Western Dakota in <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Dakota in the east.

The two tribes had been at war from at least 1736 and by 1750 the Chippewa had forced the Santee to the west into the prairie. The war between the tribes continued until at least the 1850s. Only after 1862, when the Santee rose up against the whites and were subsequently removed to the Dakota Territory, did the fighting cease. In 1872, the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of the Santee signed a treaty that resulted in their moving to the Spirit Lake Reservation.|$|E

5|$|The windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with {{distance}} {{in relation to}} surface level pressure, with the lowest pressure being found near <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> highest winds typically just on the cold/poleward side of warm fronts, occlusions, and cold fronts, where the pressure gradient force is highest.

5|$|Throughout its duration, the {{depression}} maintained a northeast track, {{due to an}} approaching shortwave trough to its north. Late on May 31, the poorly organized center crossed western Cuba, accompanied by heavy rainfall but light winds.

The depression accelerated northeastward through the Bahamas, passing near Nassau.
