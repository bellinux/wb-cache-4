5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, {{in order to minimize}} cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E

Understanding the changing surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet requires appreciation of the close links among changes in surface air temperature, surface melting, albedo, and snow accumulation.

25|$|This process, {{also known}} as the {{measured}} drop, was introduced to Britain in 1872 by William Marwood as a scientific advance on the standard drop.

The careful placement of the eye or knot of the noose (so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened) contributed to breaking the neck.|$|E
25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site.

Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|E
25|$|As some {{carotenoids}} can {{be converted}} into vitamin A, {{attempts have been made}} <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of them in the diet is equivalent to a particular amount of retinol, so that comparisons can be made of the benefit of different foods. The situation can be confusing because the accepted equivalences have changed. For many years, a system of equivalencies in which an international unit (IU) was equal to 0.3 μg of retinol, 0.6 μg of β-carotene, or 1.2 μg of other provitamin-A carotenoids was used. Later, a unit called retinol equivalent (RE) was introduced. Prior to 2001, one RE corresponded to 1 μg retinol, 2 μg β-carotene dissolved in oil (it is only partly dissolved in most supplement pills, due to very poor solubility in any medium), 6 μg β-carotene in normal food (because it is not absorbed as well as when in oils), and 12 μg of either α-carotene, γ-carotene, or β-cryptoxanthin in food.|$|E

25|$|The Fairtrade Foundation {{does not}} monitor how much extra {{retailers}} charge for Fairtrade goods, {{so it is}} rarely possible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> extra is charged or how much reaches the producers, {{in spite of the}} Unfair Trading legislation. In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing on {{less than one percent of}} the extra charged to the exporting cooperative; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi found that consumers paid much more for Fairtrade, and that only 11.5% reached the exporter. Kilian, Jones, Pratt and Villalobos talk of US Fairtrade coffee getting $5 per lb extra at retail, of which the exporter would have received only 2%. Mendoza and Bastiaensen calculated that in the UK only 1.6% to 18% of the extra charged for one product line reached the farmer. All these studies assume that the importers paid the full Fairtrade price, which is not necessarily the case.|$|E
25|$|Besieged by reporters, Ethan checks into a motel. He {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the killer, which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures.

If he chooses to complete them, then he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions, including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway, crawling through a maze composed of broken glass and active electrical pylons, cutting off one of his fingers, breaking into the apartment of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family, and drinking a glass of poison on camera. While undergoing the trials, he meets Madison Paige, a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia. She sympathizes with Ethan's plight, and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer.|$|E
25|$|Arizona v. California {{was a set}} of 11 United States Supreme Court cases {{dealing with}} water rights. These cases took place between the years of 1931 and 2006. The initial {{question}} of this case was <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> water from the Colorado river Arizona was entitled to. Many western states {{became involved in the}} debate over the rights of the water from the Colorado River, and finally the United States government became involved stating that several federal establishments, including five American Indian reservations, had water rights as defined by Winters v. United States. This United States Supreme Court case helped to solve a problem found in the case Winters v. United States. While the United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that American Indian Reservations do have reserved water rights equal to the amount of water needed on the reservation to sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable reservation acreage, there was always {{the question of how to}} decide what amount of water was needed to sufficiently irrigate on the American Indian reservations. Arizona v. California offers the solution of adjudication to help fix this problem.|$|E

25|$|Following the First World War, a Land Commission {{was set up}} in 1920 <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of {{the land}} in Nyasaland should be made {{available}} for future European settlement and what existing rights of estate tenants should be preserved and what new ones given. The Commission recommended that all permanent rent-free tenancies under non-disturbance clauses should end, but that tenants-at-will should be given some security of tenure. Apart from the elderly or widows, all should pay rents in cash, in kind or by providing labour. The owners should also have the right to evict surplus tenants to stop their estates becoming overcrowded. The Colonial Office opposed abolishing rights under non-disturbance clauses without a long fixed tenancies, and a five-year term was agreed. By the time legislation was prepared in 1928, there was little demand for more plantations, as the existing estates were ending direct production in favour of marketing tenants’ produce. The legislation enacted in 1928 therefore emphasised that rents could be satisfied by delivering a fixed quantity of acceptable crops to the owner as well as by direct labour or in cash. It met some of the estate owners’ demands but also gave some protection to tenants from the worst excesses of thangata.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2008, at Amway Arena, the Magic {{eliminated}} the Raptors with a 4–1 series {{victory in the}} first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success didn't last long as they fell 4–1 to the experienced Detroit Pistons in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At {{the conclusion of the}} 3rd quarter, Chauncey Billups of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed {{from the time of the}} malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and because there were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in question should not have counted. The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008.|$|E
