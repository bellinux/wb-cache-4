40|$|A semi-defined {{medium for}} the {{cultivation}} of bloodstream forms of the African trypanosome brucei subgroup was developed. Out of 14 different strains tested, 10 could be cultured including <b>Trypanosoma</b> brucei, T. <b>equiperdum,</b> T. evansi, T. rhodesiense and T. gambiense.

5000|$|Dourine is {{a unique}} disease {{in the sense that}} it has no known vectors or fomites {{existing}} in the natural world, other than members of the equine family, including donkeys, mules, and horses. [...] In a laboratory setting, <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>equiperdum</b> has been manipulated to adapt to and proliferate in other species, such as dogs, rabbits, mice and rats, but this has never been observed to occur naturally and without scientific manipulation. Although this limits spread of the disease because it is restricted to the equine population alone, the organism has developed complex mechanisms over time to better equip itself for prolonged survival in the equine species. This parasite efficiently evades the host animal's immune system through the use of variable surface glycoproteins or VSGs. These VSGs allow the organism to constantly manipulate and change the surface structure of its proteins, which means it is constantly being presented to the immune system as a new foreign organism and this prevents the body from mounting a large enough immune response to eradicate the disease.

50|$|Trypanosoma is a genus of kinetoplastids (class Kinetoplastida), a {{monophyletic}} {{group of}} unicellular parasitic flagellate protozoa. The name {{is derived from}} the Greek trypano- (borer) and soma (body) because of their corkscrew-like motion. Most trypanosomes are heteroxenous (requiring more than one obligatory host to complete life cycle) and most are transmitted via a vector. The majority of species are transmitted by blood-feeding invertebrates, but there are different mechanisms among the varying species. Some, such as <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>equiperdum,</b> are spread by direct contact. In an invertebrate host they are generally found in the intestine, but normally occupy the bloodstream or an intracellular environment in the mammalian host.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe cross-reacting {{antigenic}} determinant in the variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>equiperdum</b> was studied by testing {{the ability of}} VSG glycopeptides to bind heterologous anti-VSG sera.

These consist of two sidechains containing only mannose and glucosamine and a third containing galactose and mannose (in a 5 : 1 ratio) as well as phosphorous and ethanolamine. This phosphorylated fragment completely blocked the binding of VSG to heterologous anti-VSG and therefore contained the cross-reacting determinants...|$|E

40|$|Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), the {{mitochondrial}} DNA of trypanosomes, is {{an enormous}} network of interlocked minicircles and maxicircles.

Maxicircles remained in aggregates that were resistant to protease or RNase and contained no residual minicircles, but were resolved into circular monomers by topoisomerase II. Maxicircles thus form independent catenanes within kDNA networks. Heterogeneity in the size, composition, and organization of maxicircle catenanes reflects changes that occur during kDNA replication.

Data indicate different patterns of ITS 2 fragments between T. brucei, T. evansi and T. equiperdum by SSCP. Furthermore, analysis of total ITS sequences within these three members of the subgenus Trypanozoon showed a high degree of homology using phylogenetic analysis but were polyphyletic in haplotype networks.

40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} in <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>equiperdum</b> {{is associated with}} the sequential expression of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes in a process which involves gene duplication and transposition events. In this paper we present evidence that the genomic environment of the VSG- 1 basic copy gene, the template for duplicated, expression-linked VSG- 1 genes, differs in every trypanosome clone examined. This variation is thus independent of the expression of the VSG- 1 gene, and it also appears to be restricted to the 3 ' genomic environment.

The in vitro activities of the investigated compounds against this parasite correlate with their affinities to the putative binding site. Moreover, using an azido functionalized morpholino-benzyl-phenoxyethanamine as photoprobe a major M(r) = 40, 000 protein was specifically revealed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} in Trypanosoma cruzi a DNA topoisomerase {{capable of}} decatenating complex trypanosomal kinetoplast DNA {{networks in the}} absence of ATP.

The enzyme can catenate supercoiled DNA molecules, unknot DNA, and cleave double-stranded DNA. The enzyme has no ATPase activity. The native enzyme has an Mr of about 200, 000. Crude extracts and partially purified fractions contain an aggregating factor that can substitute spermidine in catenating reactions. Because of the presence of this factor, the kinetoplast DNA can only be decatenated by purified fractions. The enzyme is inhibited by certain drugs and provides a potential target for chemotherapy.

Therapy suppressed the formation of RF {{as well as of}} HA, but IgG complexes as well as antibodies against trypanosomal antigens remained present for considerable periods after the installment of therapy. It is concluded that RFs are not induced by IgG complexes. The results suggest that HA are probably not cross-reacting antibodies induced by trypanosomal antigens...|$|E
40|$|African trypanosomes are {{protozoan}} parasites that {{evade the}} host immune system by varying their dense antigenic coat.

The intensities of the S 1 -protected bands from hybrid VSGs indicate that the basic and expression linked copies are present in equivalent gene dosages. In addition, studies are presented on the expression of two additional VSG genes in T. equiperdum, VSG 4 and VSG 78, which (i) show that the basic copies are not located on telomeres even though one (VSG 4) is expressed early in infection and (ii) emphasize the role of a predominant expression site in T. equiperdum while nevertheless confirming the presence of multiple expression sites...|$|E
40|$|Type II {{interferon}} {{is known}} to be produced in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, Therefore, interferon production was investigated in mice infected with <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>equiperdum.</b> Interferon was found in the sera of mice infected with T. equiperdum from day I after infection until death on day 5. The maximal level of interferon appeared before parasitemia was detected, a finding showing that the endogenous interferon probably had no significant influence on the course of infection. Unexpectedly, the serum interferon was characterized as type I by its stability at pH 2 and by its neutralization by antiserum to virus-induced mouse inter-feron. The production of two different types of interferon in mice infected with T. cruzi and T. equiperdum may have been due to the dissimilar life cycles of the two trypanosomes in the white mouse.

Accordingly, CRAM also locates to vesicles located underneath the pocket, providing evidence of its internalization. CRAM has a predicted molecular mass of 130 kilodaltons and has a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a 41 -amino-acid cytoplasmic extension. A characteristic feature of CRAM is a large extracellular domain with a roughly 66 -fold acidic, cysteine-rich 12 -amino-acid repeat. CRAM is conserved among different protozoan species, including Trypanosoma cruzi, and CRAM has structural similarities with eucaryotic cell surface receptors.

One of the activities was maximal at acidic pH, stimulated by butanol, sensitive to cation chelator and insensitive to manganese. The activity of the other was maximal at neutral pH, stimulated by the detergent deoxycholate and independent {{of the presence of}} cation chelator or calcium. On membrane subfractionation, the acidic butanol-stimulated activity was found mainly associated with the lysosomal compartment, whereas the neutral deoxycholate-stimulated activity sediments with the myelin and plasma membrane compartment.

Immunological and fingerprint analysis on labelled pp 58, purified from these variants by affinity chromatography on Concanavalin A-Sepharose, clearly identify this component as the VSG. Furthermore, the VSGs seem to be phosphorylated to the extent of 1 mol phosphate per mol glycoprotein. The phosphorylated region is located in the extreme C-terminal region representing approximately 10 % of the total molecule. The phosphorylated residue is not an aliphatic or aromatic ester of serine, threonine, or tyrosine, nor an acyl phosphate involving an aspartyl or glutamyl residue, nor phosphohistidine.

The objective {{of this study was}} to detect antibodies against T. equiperdum and B. mallei in serum samples from horses (n= 505) of normal appearance, and from different areas of Peru but mainly from Lima by using the complement fixation test. No antibodies against T. equiperdum and B. mallei were detected in the serum samples tested. These results suggest that both diseases are absent or the prevalence are below 1 % in the studied Peruvian horses...|$|E
