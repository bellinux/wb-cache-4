5|$|Short-period comets have orbits lasting {{less than}} <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years.</b> Long-period comets have orbits lasting {{thousands}} of years. Short-period comets {{are thought to}} originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.|$|E
