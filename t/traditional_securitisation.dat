40|$|Abstract: Securitisation {{entails a}} process whereby an entity, {{known as an}} originator, {{packages}} its income producing assets, for example mortgage cash flow, and sells them to a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle (“the SPV”) by converting these assets into liquid marketable securities. To complete the process of securitisation, the securities are sold to investors. This must be distinguished from where the originator merely transfers {{the risks associated with}} the assets, which process is known as “synthetic securitization”. The present discussion only considers <b>traditional</b> <b>securitisation,</b> where the assets are sold and transferred wholly to the SPV. It further only considers securitisation by banks or banking institutions. In recent years the practice of securitisation has come under the spotlight in South African courts. The legitimacy of the process has been questioned and the courts have been called upon to establish if the securitisation transactions are valid. Securitisation will be held to be invalid in South African law if the debtor would be burdened more than he would have been had the transaction not taken place or where securitisation would deprive the debtor of defences that he would have had against the originator. This discussion considers these two instances. It further considers the merits of the mentioned court challenges against the theoretical background provided of the legal transfer of assets by cession, which is employed when the assets are transferred from the originator to the SPV.

40|$|Annual {{issuance}} of {{asset backed securities}} reached to $ 3. 650 billion globally {{at the end of}} 2005 and the securitisation activities have taken several forms ranging from <b>traditional</b> <b>securitisation</b> transactions to different types of synthetic structures. Continuous studies for the establishment of international standards and harmonisation of national regulations for accounting and regulatory capital treatment of securitisation transactions, as constituent parts of International Accounting Standards and Basel II, resulted in a very complex and widely accepted framework for securitisation activities. Turkey has also been introduced to securitisation activities with future flow securitisation transactions backed by diversified payment rights, amounting to 4. 3 billion as of June 2006. Preparation of a draft law on housing finance recently, which is establishing the legal and regulatory infrastructure for housing finance and a general securitisation framework has increased the appetite of Turkish banks for traditional ABS transactions. As a result of my analysis and overview of major concepts and developments both in a domestic and international context, some necessary actions have been addressed for a well functioning securitisation market and mitigation of major risks in Turkish banking sector. These actions can be summarised as; the maintenance of tax neutrality and bankruptcy remoteness of the domestic SPV like structures, provision of hedging opportunities through derivative transactions, limiting the level of government intervention, avoiding crowding-out effect of public borrowing requirements, establishment of domestic credit rating agencies and a national rating scale and structuring of some transactions in domestic currency. It is strongly believed that a successful implementation of securitisation together with a well functioning housing finance system will have important contributions to economic development and stability of Turkey...|$|E
40|$|The trust {{figure in}} South Africa has {{undergone}} an interesting process of evolution {{during the last}} century – from a mere gratuity or private tax evasion tool to a proper family protection, business entity, investment, and structured finance vehicle. Its flexibility and multi-functionality positioned the trust as an ideal legal institution for many innovative ideas {{in the search for}} holistic business structures, economic empowerment transactions, general estate planning and risk protection initiatives, and ultimately, its application as financial instrument and structured finance entity. The development of both <b>traditional</b> and synthetic <b>securitisation</b> schemes in South Africa has been investigated, with some emphasis on the application of the special purpose institution, which may be in trust form. It is submitted that the application of the trust figure has developed without any significant contribution from the local legislator. A sound legal and regulatory framework is crucial {{for the creation of a}} strong future environment for legal and financial vehicles. The question is, however, whether the current South African legal framework for the application of the business trust, and also as a vehicle for financial instruments, is adequately sound and robust in light of the standards set in the international business and financial environment. It is submitted that the hybrid nature of the South African legal landscape is conducive for the development of sound legal systems in an ever-changing legal and economic reality. It is further submitted that in the development of proper legal frameworks, South Africa should position itself particularly in its context as a Southern African developing democracy. The South African trust development is compared with that of some foreign jurisdictions as well as with international conventions and treaties of relevance. Some recommendations for necessary changes are made and it is submitted that such future development of the trust figure should not take place haphazardly, but within the context of a structured regulatory model...|$|R
