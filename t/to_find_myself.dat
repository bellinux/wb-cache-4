5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself.</b> So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

500|$|A former Lowell operative, {{looking back}} on her {{experience}} in the mills, expressed a similar view: “After one has worked from ten to fourteen hours at manual labor, {{it is impossible to}} study History, Philosophy, or Science,” she wrote, “I well remember the chagrin I often felt when attending lectures, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> unable to keep awake…I am sure few possessed a more ardent desire for knowledge than I did, but such was the effect of the long hour system, that my chief delight was, after the evening meal, to place my aching feet in an easy position, and read a novel.” ...|$|E

500|$|PewDiePie has himself {{claimed that}} he dislikes being called [...] "famous", and has been {{reported}} to live a [...] "shy and retiring life". In a Rolling Stone article, PewDiePie admitted to being shocked by his fame; PewDiePie recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating [...] "I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up — it was out of control. It was shocking <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> in that situation, where I was that celebrity person." [...] At the 2013 Social Star Awards, PewDiePie greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so. PewDiePie also mentioned this event to Rolling Stone, stating, [...] "I didn't even understand they were screaming for me at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Players {{discuss issues}} of {{interpretation}} in rehearsal; but often, in mid-performance, players do things spontaneously, requiring {{the other players}} to respond in real time. [...] "After twenty years in the [...] Quartet, I'm happily surprised on occasion <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> totally wrong about what I think a player will do, or how he'll react in a particular passage", says violist Michael Tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{nothing of}} the kind; but seeing how {{conflicting}} was current opinion, I took some trouble <b>to</b> <b>find</b> for <b>myself</b> a justification of the war. I couldn't help wondering why I went and killed people to whom I was personally quite indifferent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I only hoped so. I feared I {{might be}} wrong. But I began <b>to</b> <b>find</b> holding <b>myself</b> back {{was getting too}} hard, and I was afraid {{somebody}} else might come along who {{had the power to}} rouse you. I believe you can be roused." ...|$|R

2500|$|During the interview, Phillips read {{excerpts}} from her book. She {{said that at}} the age of 19, on the night before her first wedding, [...] "I woke up that night from a blackout <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> having sex with my own father", and that when she confronted her father months later, asking why he had raped her, her father simply replied, [...] "Raped you? Don't you mean we made love?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Even before Peyton Place was released, Adler cast Varsi {{opposite}} Don Murray in {{the western}} From Hell to Texas (1958). She appeared in the films Ten North Frederick (1958) and Compulsion (1959). While filming Ten North Frederick, Varsi suffered a nervous breakdown, collapsed and was hospitalized. She later said: [...] "I'm still trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself.</b> It's still {{hard for me to}} separate illusion from reality... I don't know whether acting is the form of creativity best for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but I kept on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer Dick! unbalanced, perhaps, {{by living}} too much {{alone in the}} woods," [...] I thought, and took to {{examining}} the torn ground and the bull's tracks <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out for <b>myself</b> what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|I did {{not intend}} to have any further words with these young women on this subject, but I cannot deny that I was annoyed and mortified. This {{was the result of a}} {{charitable}} action. I think I was never more proud of anything than of catching that trout; and it was a good deal of a downfall <b>to</b> suddenly <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> regarded as a mere city man fishing with a silver hook. But, after all, what did it matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and {{you thought}} it was SHE, didn't you? Well, and you're caught! I didn't believe it; I wouldn't believe it when they said it. I {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it out <b>myself.</b> And I have; and it's true." ...|$|R
60|$|You are so {{candid about}} your age that I shall tell you mine! I am {{astonished}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> sixty-eight--very near the Psalmist's threescore and ten.

60|$|Mr. Carlyle {{introduced}} {{a style of}} thinking about Knox which may be called platonically Puritan. Sweet enthusiasts glide swiftly over all in the Reformer that is specially distasteful <b>to</b> us.

5000|$|When Letitia {{accepted}} {{a position at}} Rev. Daniel McMullen's Picton Ladies' Academy, she travelled there by steamer October, 1849, during what she called [...] "that inclement season."

[...] "It was joy supreme <b>to</b> once more <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> safe on terra firma." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! Didn't I {{tell you}} to go round and see what {{was the kind of}} {{religious}} dispensation here?" [...] continued Jack, with an unmoved face. [...] "Didn't I charge you particularly to observe if the Catholic Church was such as a professing Christian and the former organist of the Second Presbyterian Church of Sacramento could attend? And now I suppose I've got <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out <b>myself.</b> I'd bet ten to one you ain't been there at all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope there}} is no deceit. I said to her, 'We have lost our way, and I must try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> mine by <b>myself.</b> Go to that gentleman, and tell him you are lost. You shall be fetched by-and-by.' Perhaps you have not thought how very young she is?" ...|$|R

"For years I {{have been}} researching the {{background}} of the trade in erotic pictures, not because it is currently in fashion but as someone who is immediately affected: the constant overstimulation has had a direct influence on my life.

5000|$|Once I had {{graduated}} from UCLA, I decided {{that as long as}} I was an actress, I was going <b>to</b> <b>find</b> related work in the industry. There were plenty of opportunities.
