Then, from the generated residuals and RMS evaluation function, the <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> is proposed based on sliding mode interval estimation module {{to ensure that the}} RMS evaluation of residuals is less than the generated threshold. By using recent results of the bounded real lemma for internally positive systems, a set of suﬃcient conditions to detect incipient faults via linear matrix inequality (LMI) is presented.

Since analysis of particle {{sizes and shapes}} from two-dimensional TEM images is affected by variations in image contrast between adjacent particles, automatic methods requires more efforts. The proposed hybrid method consists of two main steps: automatic segmentation and nano-particles counting. The segmentation procedure begins with an automatic <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> and moves towards a high efficient multiple- regions segmentation technique. Results are observed, compared with existing methods and manual counting...|$|E
40|$|Detection of faults, such as clogged valves, broken {{bearings}} or biased sensors, {{has been}} brought more and more into focus {{during the last few}} decades. There are two main reasons why faults are important to detect at an early stage. Firstly, faults in safety critical applications, such as aircraft, nuclear reactors, cars and trains, may create risks of personal injuries. Secondly, faults in the manufacturing or process industry, e. g. flotation processes and steel plants, may cause decrease in quality or interruptions of production. A fault detection algorithm consists of two parts, the residual generator, which generates a residual, and the residual evaluator, which compares the residual, or a function of it, with a threshold to determine if a fault is present. The residual generation contains a process model and the residual can be described as a filtered difference between the measured and estimated process outputs. When no fault is present, the residual will be nonzero due to residual disturbances, i. e. measurement disturbances, process disturbances and model uncertainties. Therefore, the residual evaluation must be robust against these disturbances to avoid false alarms. Due to the model uncertainties, the residual is affected by the known input signals, which are, in general, time varying. To achieve a threshold that is as tight to the residual as possible, the threshold should also depend on the known input signals. To make this possible, parametric uncertainty in the process model is considered in this thesis. The dynamic <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> is introduced, a dynamic system whose output is the threshold and the inputs are the known process inputs. A dynamic <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> is developed for full-state measurement systems, assuming that the residual disturbances are constant and unknown but bounded. This dynamic <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> is then generalized to non-full state measurement systems with time-varying but bounded residual disturbances. Both generators depend on the unknown upper bounds of the residual disturbances. These upper bounds are replaced by design parameters, which are determined by minimizing the threshold for a set of fault free data. A nonlinear optimization solution is discussed. It is also shown that the residual generator state vector can always be parameterized such that the designing of the parameters can be done by linear optimization. A part of the generalized dynamic <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> is a system whose impulse response is an upper bound to another impulse response. Automatic methods to find realizable upper bounds are derived. To validate the methods in this thesis, two applications have been considered, detection of clogging in the valves of a flotation process and detection of faults in the compressor inlet temperature sensor of a jet engine.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{strategies for}} detecting and diagnosing the chiller component faults and the sensor faults involved in chiller conditioning monitoring and control. The two strategies {{are used in}} series. One strategy diagnoses and validates the sensor faults. After the sensor faults are validated, the other strategy monitors the health condition and diagnoses the faults of chiller components. The health monitoring and diagnosis of the sensors are conducted using PCA (Principle Component Analysis) method. The chiller component condition monitoring and diagnosis is conducted based on the reference models of six performance indexes and an online <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> updating the fault detection thresholds following the change of working conditions.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that shock wave lithotripsy machines vary {{in their ability to}} fragment standardized artificial urinary calculi. An in vitro test configuration was used to fragment synthetic U- 30 Gypsum (U. S. Gypsum, Chicago, IL) stones (mean length 7. 1 [*]±[*] 0. 2 [*]mm, mean diameter 6. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 07 [*]mm, mean mass 299 [*]±[*] 16 [*]mg) using the Sonolith i-sys (EDAP TMS, Vaulx-en-Velin, France), Modulith SLX F 2 (Storz Medical AG, Tägerwilen, Switzerland), and Piezolith 3000 (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) lithotripters. Gypsum stones were placed at the nominal focus and treated with 250, 500, or 1000 shocks. The residual mass following passage through a 2 -mm wire mesh was measured and compared using ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer HSD test. There was no statistically significant difference between the Modulith SLX F 2 and Piezolith 3000 lithotripters for 250 and 1000 shock treatments (p[*]=[*] 0. 34 and 0. 31, respectively). The Piezolith 3000 demonstrated the most favorable stone mass reduction for 500 shock treatments (187. 4 [*]±[*] 45. 2 [*]mg). The Sonolith i-sys was found to be significantly less effective than the other lithotripters for all shockwave conditions. Furthermore, performance of the Sonolith i-sys decreased beyond a <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> electrode age of 6000 shocks. This in vitro study found considerable variability in the ability of lithotripters to fragment synthetic urinary calculi. Synthetic stones were employed to provide a repeatable means of assessing variability in fragmentation efficiency of lithotripters. The Modulith SLX F 2 and Piezolith 3000 are broadly equal and resulted in greater fragmentation efficiencies than the Sonolith i-sys. The performance of the Sonolith i-sys deteriorates at 6000 shocks, before the specified lifetime of 20, 000 shocks...|$|E
40|$|An un-permitted {{deviation}} {{of at least}} one characteristic property or parameter of a system from standard condition is referred as a fault. Faults result in reduced efficiency of the system, reduced quality of the product, and sometimes complete breakdown of the process. This not only causes economic losses but may also result in fatalities. An early detection of faults can assist to avert these losses. Therefore, fault detection and process monitoring is becoming an essential part of modern control systems. Fault detection in linear dynamical systems has been extensively studied and well established techniques exist in the literature. However, fault detection for nonlinear dynamical systems is yet an active field of research. This work is motivated by {{the fact that most of}} real systems are nonlinear in nature and there is a need to develop fault detection techniques for nonlinear systems. Observer-based methods for fault detection have proven to be among the most capable approaches, therefore, this research is focused towards these methods. The first step in observer-based fault detection is to generate a symptom signal, called the residual signal, which carries the information of faults. This is done by comparing the measurements from the process to their estimates generated by an observer (filter). It is desired that the residual signal is sensitive to faults and robust against disturbances. This research presents new methods for designing observer (filter) to generate residual signal which is sensitive to faults and robust against disturbances. Three types of filters are proposed in this dissertation; these include a fault sensitive filter, disturbance attenuating filter, and a filter to achieve simultaneous attenuation of disturbances and amplification of faults. Despite the disturbance attenuation property of the proposed filters, the residual signal is not completely decoupled from the effect of disturbances and uncertainties. Therefore, a threshold is needed to care for the effect of disturbances and uncertainties. Selection of threshold plays an important role in the performance of the fault detection system. If it is selected too high, some faults will not be detected. Conversely, if it is selected too low, disturbances and uncertainties will result in false alarms. This research presents a new method to determine the threshold to avoid false-alarms and to minimize missed-detections. A <b>threshold</b> <b>generator</b> is proposed which is itself a dynamic system and produces a variable threshold. This threshold changes with the effects of uncertainties and disturbances and fits more tightly to the fault-free residual signal and, hence, the performance of fault detection system is improved. In addition to the residual generation stage, the efficiency of a fault detection system can also be optimized by post-filtering. A further contribution of this research is in proposing a post-filter which operates on the residual signal to generate a modified residual signal. This modified residual signal is simultaneously sensitive to faults and robust against disturbances. Together with this post-filter, a strategy is adopted to select a threshold which maximizes the fault detectability and minimizes the number of false-alarms...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{top quark}} {{production}} threshold {{will be one of}} the most important tasks for the International Linear Collider (ILC). An improved precision on measurements {{of the top}} quark mass, its width, and the strong coupling constant αs, together with other electroweak parameters can provide tight constraints of the mass of the Higgs, and possible extensions of the Standard Model. Important aspects of these measurements include precise predictions for the observable quantities at the top threshold and a precise understanding of the machine’s luminosity spectrum. In this report I describe work on progress for a precision top <b>threshold</b> event <b>generator,</b> and the development of a beam energy spectrometer, a device that will enable us to better understand the luminosity spectrum of the ILC, and hence, together with the pre-cision event generator, and more extensive studies of the luminosity spectrum, determin...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions {{produce a}} range of hazards which can impact society. The most {{widespread}} of these hazards is volcanic ash fall which can impact {{a range of}} critical infrastructure. Power systems are particularly vulnerable to ash fall hazards and the resulting impacts may lead to power supply disruption. This can lead to cascading disruption of dependent systems, such as hospitals, water and wastewater treatment plants, telecommunications and emergency services. Typically, large emergency power generator sets are used to provide emergency power supply for essential services during electrical power outages. There has been little study of what impact ash fall exposure will have on generator performance. International experience suggests large generators can experience rapid performance reduction when exposed to high concentrations of suspended or falling ash due to obstruction of air filters and radiators, causing overheating of the engine and shut down of the generator system. However, {{it is not clear}} at what ash fall <b>thresholds</b> <b>generators</b> are likely to be disrupted. This research uses custom designed empirical laboratory experiments to investigate the performance of large generators subjected to a range of volcanic ash fall types and intensities, simulating both proximal and distal ash fall exposure from a range of eruptive styles. It also investigates the application of temporary external filters to minimise the ingestion of volcanic ash into generator housings. The results are used to inform recommendations on the likely impacts of ash to generators and the most effective type of mitigation, which maximises filtration whilst maintaining generator performance. Control tests recorded high particle concentrations (~ 0. 006 mg/m 3) which indicate substantial ash contamination is possible. Multiple factors were considered to determine the best mitigation measure including the lowest particle concentration, highest air speed and the ease with which the measure could be fitted. The study found material filtration to be the most effective measure; however as the quality of filtration increased, the air speed was reduced and thus so was the volume of air available to the generator engine. Therefore, the type of filtration required is dependent the ash fall intensity. The study also found that a deflection hood is an effective mitigation measure; maintaining airspeed while reducing particle concentrations within the generator. This research informs risk management strategies for critical infrastructure organisations {{to reduce the risk of}} generator disruption during volcanic ash falls...|$|R
40|$|Digital halftoning is {{used both}} in {{low and high}} {{resolution}} high quality printing technologies. Our method {{is designed to be}} mainly used for low resolution ink jet marking machines to produce both gray tone and color images. The main problem with digital halftoning is pink noise caused by the human eye's visual transfer function. To compensate for this the random dot patterns used are optimized to contain more blue than pink noise. Several such dot pattern <b>generator</b> <b>threshold</b> matrices have been created automatically by using genetic algorithm optimization, a non-deterministic global optimization method imitating natural evolution and genetics. A hybrid of genetic algorithm with a search method based on local backtracking was developed together with several fitness functions evaluating dot patterns for rectangular grids. By modifying the fitness function, a family of dot generators results, each with its particular statistical features. Several versions of genetic algorithms, backtracking and fitness functions were tested to find a reasonable combination. The generated threshold matrices have been tested by simulating a set of test images using the Khoros image processing system. Even though the work was focused on developing low resolution marking technology, the resulting family of dot generators can be applied also in other halftoning application areas including high resolution printing technology...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} {{in the area of}} collaborative work can be enhanced by tracking users regularly. Consider a future emergency management application, in which mobile first responders are continuously tracked in order to support a better coordination of the rescue missions and to create a mission log. However, continuous tracking of individuals and storing the data for later use is often in conflict with individual privacy preferences. Therefore, it is a challenge to deal with conflicting traceability and privacy protection requirements. A common way to implement some kind of privacy protection is to use pseudonyms instead of fixed IDs for each user. However, in order to build a multilateral secure and acceptable solution, a more complex system design w. r. t. to pseudonym linkability is required, that also allows third parties to analyze the logs for organizational and legal reasons. In this paper, we present our approach to deal with this issue: we propose to encode additional information into pseudonyms that are used in location tracking systems and stored in data logs. Our concept comprises both access rights for the user herself and implicit attributes that may be verified by third parties in a privacy-respecting manner. We introduce the cryptographic constructions, which employ cryptographically secure pseudorandom number <b>generators,</b> <b>threshold</b> cryptography and techniques for securely evaluating encrypted data. Moreover, in this paper, we sketch a practical application example in the area of emergency mission log analysis and discuss the main security properties of our concepts...|$|R
40|$|Disaster {{prevention}} {{in civil}} infrastructures requires {{the use of}} techniques that allow temperature and strain measurements in real time over lengths of a few meters to tens of kilometres. The distributed Brillouin sensor (DBS) technique has the advantage to combine all these characteristics. The sensing mechanism of the DBS involves the interaction of two counter-propagating lightwaves, the Stokes and the pump, in an optical fibre. Spatial information is obtained through time domain analysis. The sensing data are recorded from the measurement of the pump depletion. We explore the benefits and the drawbacks of this approach and show that there is a power range for which the sensing performances are optima. To achieve that goal, Brillouin fibre generator (BFG) and amplifier (BFA) were studied leading to the derivation of a threshold definition for the BFA, which is the configuration of the DBS. Within that context, numerical and analytical models describing the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) interaction are introduced and validated experimentally. Even if pump depletion is carefully controlled, the Brillouin spectrum shape, and hence the sensor performance, still depend on the sensing parameters such as power, pulse and fibre characteristics. We use a signal processing method grounded in the physics of Brillouin scattering. An analytical approximation, valid for the optimum sensing region, reconstructs the Brillouin spectrum distribution from input sensing parameters and measured data. These data are obtained with a spectrum analysis methodology, based on three original tools: the Rayleigh equivalent criterion, the lengthstress diagram, and the spectrum form factors. This methodology has been successfully used on experimental spectra. The DBS and the signal processing approach were then used to monitor the structural changes in steel pipes and in a composite column, all subjected to heavy loads. The DBS measured the strain distribution of those structures while they were stressed. The DBS provided detailed information on the structure's health at local and global level, associated with deformations, cracks and buckling. This work demonstrates that the DBS is capable of extracting critical information useful to engineers: engineer's experience and judgement in conjunction with appropriate data processing methods make possible to anticipate structural failures.
