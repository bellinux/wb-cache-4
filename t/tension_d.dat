40|$|Reconstruction of the Cenozoic palaeostress {{fields in}} the western part of Hornád Depression, south of Poprad town, was the main goal of the research. This was done on the basis of {{analysis}} of fault-slips. The most important was the detailed study of fault-slip kinematics. The deformation structures were measured and recorded in the Permian volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Malužiná Formation (Hronic Unit), and in the sequences of the Borové Formation, which is a basal part of the Central Carpathian Palaeogene Basin. The youngest measured rocks were the Lower Pleistocene travertines at the locality of Hranovnické pleso. An observed chronology of deformation phases can be divided into the seven different palaeostress fields. The oldest tectonic event (D 1) was generated in terms of strike-slip tectonic regime with the W–E compression. This was recorded only in the Malužiná Formation, together with the second deformation stage. This performs strike-slip tectonic regime with the WNW–ESE compression (D 2). Both deformations were conditionally included in the age between the Lower Palaeocene to Oligocene. The next, very distinct deformation event (D 3) is represented by the NW–SE oriented compression in the strike-slip tectonic regime. This event includes the subset, which performs pure NE–SW <b>tension</b> (<b>D</b> 3 a) tenuously dated at the Early–Middle Miocene, because this phase also affected the Palaeogene sediments. The fourth generation of faults (D 4) were activated during the Middle Miocene under strike-slip tectonic regime with N–S compression, in general. The age was determined relatively, because the deformation structures (D 4) are cut by fault of the D 5 stage. The fifth phase of deformation (D 5) originated in strike-slip tectonic regime with the NE–SW direction of compression. The age of the deformation is considered to be the Late Miocene. The sixth deformation stage (D 6) is characterized by the pure W–E extension. The stage was originated in the Quaternary age, because it was identified only in the Lower Pleistocene travertines, the same as the last, youngest tectonic phase.

In SDS-PAGE analysis, components with electrophoretic migration similar to decorin and fibromodulin increased with maturation, particularly in the d region.

At a range of d. 0. t. from 0. 002 to 0. 05 atm, which allowed good growth (mean generation time approxi-mately I- 5 h), L-lactate was preferentially consumed before D-lactate. L-Lactate oxidation was accompanied by equimolar acetate production during exponential growth. A value for YL-lactete (g dry weight bacteria per mol L-lactate) of 54 was determined. Net acetate pro-duction stopped when C. sputorum started to use D-lactate after consumption of L-lactate. When a culture growing exponentially {{at the expense of}} L-lactate was shifted from a d. 0. t. of 0 - 02 atm to a d. 0. t. of 0. 15 atm, growth was impaired, and L-lactate consumption and corresponding acetate production diminished.

Changes in the specific activities {{of two of the}} key enzymes of alginate biosynthesis (phosphomannose isomerase and GDPmannose pyrophosphorylase), measured in extracts of cells grown with sucrose under a range of d. 0. t. values, were reflected by the observed changes in alginate production; the activity of GDPmannose dehydrogenase was unchanged. A similar correlation between the specific activities of these enzymes and the rate of alginate production was observed during a transition from sorbitol to sucrose as the sole carbon source, but in this experiment the activity of GDPmannose dehydrogenase also increased with increasing alginate production. After prolonged continuous cultivation on sucrose the mutant gradually lost the ability to produce alginate. The key enzymes of alginate biosynthesis could not be detected in extracts of this non-alginate-producing strain, which had also lost the ability to encyst.

40|$|Railhead {{is perhaps}} the highest {{stressed}} civil infrastructure due {{to the passage of}} heavily loaded wheels through a very small contact patch. The stresses at the contact patch cause yielding of the railhead material and wear. Many theories exist for the prediction of these mechanisms of continuous rails; this process in the discontinuous rails is relatively sparingly researched. Discontinuous railhead edges fail due to accumulating excessive plastic strains. Significant safety concern is widely reported as these edges form part of Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) in the signalling track circuitry. Since Hertzian contact is not valid at a discontinuous edge, 3 D finite element (3 DFE) models of wheel contact at a railhead edge have been used in this research. Elastic–plastic material properties of the head hardened rail steel have been experimentally determined through uniaxial monotonic tension tests and incorporated into a FE model of a cylindrical specimen subject to cyclic <b>tension</b> load- <b>ing.</b> The parameters required for the Chaboche kinematic hardening model have been determined from the stabilised hysteresis loops of the cyclic load simulation and imple- mented into the 3 DFE model.

Therefore to eliminate this failure mechanism, modification to the contact patch is essential; reduction in wheel load cannot solve this problem...|$|R

Conceptualizing plans to change in the practices of teaching and assessment will be necessary to know in depth what teachers and students think and do in the areas of teaching and assessment. In recent years there has been an obvious interest in investigating topics such as: a) the involvement and participation of students in assessment processes, b) diversification and utilization of innovative strategies for evaluation, c) the systematic use of feedback, <b>d)</b> <b>tensions</b> and relations practices resulting from formative and summative assessment. However, the research carried out in higher education is still quite scarce, taking into account the need to understand a number of crucial issues that will improve student learning.

40|$|In many {{languages}}, {{as shown}} cross-linguistically in Heine and Kuteva (2002), or for Chadic languages by Frajzyngier (1987), ventive verbs {{are the source}} of ventive markers in grammaticalization processes. Berber languages are, like Chadic ones, characterized by the extensive use of ventive verbal extensions, and to a lesser extent, andative ones. Contrary to what is generally assumed, and reflected in the label of the morpheme, ventive extensions in Berber are not limited to motion verbs, although those verbs (as 'arrive', wwḍ 'reach', ffγ, 'exit', ṛuḥ 'come/go') are part of the core group to which the extension is cliticized in all the Berber languages where this marker is grammaticalized, thus specifying the direction or endpoint of the movement. This group also contains other verbs that often, or usually bear the ventive clitic: fk 'give', awy 'carry', ğğ 'leave', ini 'say', af 'find'. We hypothesize that this group shows the first stage of grammaticalization of the ventive clitic. This core, common to a number of Berber languages, is further expanded in some of them, such as Kabyle (Northern Berber), so that a great number of verbal roots are associated to the ventive clitic: out of 10 000 verb occurrences in a continuous spoken corpus of Kabyle, 20 % carry this clitic. Virtually any verb, mostly dynamic but also stative, can be associated to =dd, thus expressing such a variety of nuances as coming into existence, change-of-state, present relevance, focus, emphasis, and benefactive. ur=dd zwiğ-ɣ alamma t-kks=dd Fatima aɣrum g udəkkan NEG=VENT marry/NEGPFV-SBJ 1 SG until SBJ 3 SG. F-take/PFV=VENT Fatima bread:ABS LOC shelf:ANN 'I won't marry until Fatima is able to take the bread from the shelf' (Kabyle) The first aim of our study is to examine those uses and propose a grammaticalization network that may explain the variety of directions taken by this grammaticalization, which seems to follow the cline from propositional to interpersonal. Given the lack of ancient written sources, cross-linguistic comparison inside the language family is the only way in which the diffusion of that clitic into the system can be reconstructed. A likely candidate for the source of this grammaticalization is the verb ddu, which expresses motion (unspecified directionally), with a comitative component in Kabyle. That component can be the main feature of the verb in some Berber languages, such as Tahaggart (Southern Berber), whereas it is absent from others, such as Tachelhit (Northern Berber) (Galand 1978 : 200). Another candidate is the deictic d, which comes into the composition of the 'future' (actually potential) particle ad, and is probably the source of the comitative preposition d, and the equative copula <b>d.</b> However, the <b>tension</b> distinction (<b>d</b> vs dd) being phonological in Berber, there is no direct equivalence between ventive clitic =dd and the deictic d. The second part of this study consists in providing arguments for both hypotheses, and suggesting that the grammaticalization process, rather than being traceable to one at the exclusion of the other, {{is the result of a}} complex network of semantic features shared by verb and deictic marker, as well as the result of analogical processes...|$|R
40|$|K contractures and {{asymmetrical}} charge movement {{were recorded}} in extensor digitorum longus (e. d. l.) and soleus muscles that had been denervated for 2 - 68 days. The relationship between maximum tension during a K contracture and membrane potential shifted to more negative potentials in denervated e. d. l. muscles (by - 25 mV on average) {{and to a lesser}} extent in soleus (by - 8 mV on average), and became steeper, more so in e. d. l. than soleus. Apart from an early negative shift of - 11 mV in the voltage dependence of <b>tension</b> in e. <b>d.</b> l. muscles during the first week, the other changes in K contractures following denervation occurred progressively during the first 3 weeks and then stabilized. There was a clear difference in charge movement in denervated e. d. l. fibres but little change in denervated soleus fibres, so that the characteristics of charge movement in e. d. l. and soleus became very similar. The maximum amount of charge movement fell from an average normal value of 23 nC/microF to 6 nC/microF in e. d. l. within the first 2 weeks. The voltage sensitivity shifted to more negative potentials (by about - 12 mV on average) within the first week. There was no significant change in the slope of the relationship between charge and membrane potential. The effects of denervation on charge movement could only partly explain the changes in K contractures. The only obvious parallels were the early negative shift in the voltage dependence of charge movement and tension in denervated e. d. l. fibres. The other changes in K contractures in denervated fibres could be due to a change in the relationship between charge movement and Ca concentration in the myoplasm or an increase in the Ca affinity of the myofilaments. Although charge movement fell to about a quarter of normal in denervated e. d. l. fibres, membrane capacity increased approximately 3 -fold. A similar increase in capacity in soleus fibres was not associated with a change in charge movement. Fewer indentations were seen in denervated than in normal e. d. l. fibres.

40|$|The 'increase of scale' as {{a process}} of social change has a {{detrimental}} effect on many small communities in the country. The number of inhabitants in some hamlets, villages, country-towns and other small rural communities is decreasing; small communities have lost to some extent their function as trade centres. A lot of people living in many of these small country communities dislike this process of decline. This study has been focused on a twofold problem: 1. What changes have taken place in the distribution of both population and provisions in the countryside during the last decades? Which factors have influenced this process? 2. What effect does the change in distribution of both population and provisions have on rural people? How do these people, particularly in small communities, react to this change and how can the way they react be explained? Hence this study has two parts: Part I looks from the outside at the social forces that affect the development of cummunities. Part II discusses the social life within these rural communities that are under stress from the 'increase of scale'. In Part I, processes of social change are considered that may be connected with the difficulties many small rural communities are facing. In the general concept of 'increase of scale' three aspects can be distinguished: physical, structural and mental. The increase of scale in the physical sense is defined as the increase in number of members of social units and the enlargement of spatial units (e. g. plots, number of buildings). With the increase of the structural scale both individuals and social units are involved in more embracing networks of interaction and communication. The increase of the mental scale includes changes in the culture of a historical-geographical group (e. g. village-community, city-community, national community) by which the affective ties of its members with the group as a whole diminish. Then the norms, expectations and values of the members change to those of the 'higher ranking' historical-geographical groups. In this study the concept of the small rural community is defined as an aggregation of individuals who a. live together in a centre of limited size or else both in a centre and on scattered holdings; b. do not need to go to other places for at least a part of their daily necessities; c. are characterized by a certain awareness of a collective identity that has resulted from their living together. First some theoretical starting-points and concepts are discussed. Then the number and the geographical distribution of small rural communities, in the Netherlands as well as in other countries in Europe and in Northern America, are considered. The history of the patterns of villages and other rural communities is discussed in detail, particularly for the Netherlands. It was concluded that the degree of autonomy that a rural community had in the past was of great importance to its present social status. This applies not only to towns, but also to boroughs, villages, hamlets and so on. Chapter 4 is devoted to population change of rural communities and how it can be influenced by community size, distance to an urban centre, the economic region in which the community is situated, relative size of population occupied in agriculture, type of farming area and level of retail and service facilities. For each of these factors data from the literature are discussed. Additional data are provided from an investigation into the development of size of Dutch rural communities. For this study, statistics were taken from the censuses held in 1947, 1956 and 1960. The results supported HART and SALISBURY (1965, p. 157) who came to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that'population growth and decline, even in the village, is far too complex a phenomenon to permit of any simple explanation'. Moreover it appeared that a quantitative approach to the small rural community problem has to be characterized as partial, because it is mainly directed to the physical aspect of the increase of scale process. The last chapter of Part I describes how small rural communities have developed to provide rural people with retail and service facilities. In particular, attention is paid to shopkeepers and artisans, primary schools, religious care, voluntary associations, government and other provisions. From the data it was concluded that in the Netherlands the geographical distribution of provisions has become concentrated {{at the expense of the}} small rural communities. However, there was a marked difference generally betweeen material provisions and social and cultural facilities. In small rural communities the latter, especially primary schools, were scarcely decreasing in number but there appeared to be an obvious concentration of most of the material provisions. Part II also starts with theoretical reflections. Firstly, as small rural communities in the western World generally may be considered as social groups, it is suggested that when small rural communities lose some or all of their functions, their inhabitants usually value their living conditions negatively. Secondly, attention is paid to the various ways small rural communities could react to a physical or structural increase of scale. With the help of literature, five states of reaction are described: a. social isolation, b. social <b>tension,</b> c. disorientation, <b>d.</b> integration, c. assimilation. Thirdly, the concept of locality group identification (Dutch: dorpsbinding) is defined as the phenomenon by which people feel themselves emotionally tied to their local society. Locality group identification can only occur if the local society is symbolized by ail object of a material or non-material nature. This object must refer to the social life of the local community concerned. This concept of locality group identification explains to a great extent the way small rural communities are reacting to increase of scale. Chapter 7 deals with the design of the investigation into the second part of the problem. Random samples of adolescents, and adults, both male and female, were interviewed by means of structured schedules. Then a short description is given of the four Dutch rural areas in which data were collected between 1963 and 1965 both by formal and informal interviews. Chapter 9 contains a synopsis and comments of the informal interviews (about 150 in number) with key-persons in the four areas. After these interviews, the preliminary hypotheses made in Chapter 6 were reformulated. The definite hypotheses on the reaction of people living in small rural communities to increase of scale are as follows: 1. In spite of the decline in retail and service facilities, people living in small rural communities value their living conditions positively. 2. Because many inhabitants of small rural communities identify themselves strongly with their local society: a. they direct themselves to their own locality to a high degree, at least for their daily necessities, b. they must act according to precise norms which means making as much use as possible of the provisions their community offers, c. they have a limited social horizon. 3. The locality group identification is connected with a number of variables such as duration of living in the present place of residence, age, occupation, religious denomination and position held in the local leadership structure. In Chapter 10 the hypothesis first mentioned is tested. In each rural area, 30 to 50 percent of the respondents living in small communities valued their living conditions negatively. There was an obvious connection between the evaluation of the living conditions and the degree of locality group identification. Therefore for rural people living in small communities the social relationships, especially those in their own local community, must be considered as more important for their welfare than providing them with goods and services. Data taken from the formal interviews showed that in all of the small communities three quarters or more of the respondents identified themselves strongly with their local community. In contrast to hypothesis 2 a, it appeared that in general only a week connection existed between a strong locality group identification and the direction of the respondents to their own locality to satisfy both material and non-material needs. At least in two of the areas concerned, there were rather precise norms in making use of the local provisions. The last part of hypothesis 2 was confirmed. In Chapter 12 on the basis of the formal interview data the locality group identification is analysed further. The hypothesized connection between this phenomenon and many variables became evident. The results of investigating the connection between the degree of locality group identification and the position held in the local leadership structure were surprising. In one of the areas, local leaders had an obviously stronger locality group identification than their followers, whereas in another area in which also many of the respondents identified themselves strongly with the local community, the result was the reverse. Therefore locality group identification has to be considered a more central value in the former area than in the latter. In my final remarks, I give my opinions on the significance of some findings to policy on rural physical planning...|$|R
