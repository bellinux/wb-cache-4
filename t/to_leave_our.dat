500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Beyoncé said: [...] "We all see the {{headlines}} and we think what can I really do to help?... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E
2500|$|With {{immigrant}} Catholics increasingly {{allied with}} the Democratic Party, most anti-Catholicism {{was found in the}} Republican Party typified by the statement of Rev. Samuel D.

Only a small remnant will remain. We must reconstruct as best we can. We find buried silver in good quantities and plenty of grain, so that our people have plenty to eat and to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anousheh Ansari {{became the}} first Iranian in space and the first self-funded woman to fly to the station. Officials {{reported}} that her education and experience make her {{much more than a}} tourist, and her performance in training had been [...] "excellent." [...] Ansari herself dismisses the idea that she is a tourist. She did Russian and European studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10-day stay. The documentary Space Tourists follows her journey to the station, where she fulfilled [...] "an age-old dream of man: <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> planet as a [...] "normal person" [...] and travel into outer space." ...|$|E

So you have the intent to impose a hierarchy, you have bigotry, and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops {{up all over the}} world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity[...] It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] She also said, [...] "You should question authority and you should not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Coming so {{unexpectedly}} as {{this offer}} does, {{it would be}} difficult, if not impossible, to arrange the business of an extensive practice, between this and the first of November, in a manner at all satisfactory to myself, or {{to those who have}} committed their interests to my care, and who rely on my services. Besides, you know that Mrs. Pierce's health, while at Washington, was very delicate. It is, I fear, even more so now; and the responsibilities which the proposed change would necessarily impose upon her ought, probably, in themselves, to constitute an insurmountable objection <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>our</b> quiet home for a public station at Washington.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, surely," [...] I {{promptly}} replied, [...] "my assent <b>to</b> your <b>leaving</b> <b>our</b> discussion {{where it}} stands {{would constitute a}} very different symptom.

2500|$|In {{working around}} the other Marvel Netflix series, Buck {{described}} [...] "a fair amount of freedom", but [...] "because we are leading into The Defenders, we have <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> show in a very specific place with our character, because we do sort of plant seeds and stories that will then come to fruition in The Defenders. There does {{have to be a}} lot of cooperation between all the different" [...] series' showrunners for that aspect. [...] "But other than that," [...] he continued, [...] "we work distinctly by ourselves." [...] The season makes references to the events of The Avengers, the Hulk, Stark Industries, Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Seagate Prison, and mentions the Dogs of Hell biker gang, New York Bulletin editor-in-chief Mitchell Ellison and reporter Karen Page, Roxxon Oil and Midland Circle. The events of the second season of Daredevil, such as The Hand's attack on Metro General Hospital, is noted throughout the season, and The Hand's blood draining facility is also seen.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, HaKohen {{helped found}} the Zionist Freedom Alliance to promote Jewish {{national}} rights on American college campuses and co-hosted a radio program called Jewish Campus Radio on Israel National Radio (channel seven). The program dealt with all issues facing Jewish college students in the West but focused primarily on political activism on American college campuses. In the summer of 2007, INR asked HaKohen to host their new program, The Struggle, which dealt with Jewish history and global issues that concern the State of Israel. HaKohen used his radio show {{to speak out against}} Islamophobia and to place blame for the Arab–Israeli conflict on third parties, particularly the United States and Europe. In December 2008, HaKohen told Israel National News that: [...] "It was the British who originally turned local Arabs and Jews against one another in order to further their own colonialist agenda for our region. And now Western governments arm both sides and then attempt to impose artificial diplomatic solutions. The Israeli government and PA leaderships today both behave as puppets to foreign regimes and both the local Jewish and Arab populations are suffering. The way to achieve real peace between peoples here is to work from the bottom up and not the top down. The Jewish and Arab peoples are both native to the Middle East. We have a great deal in common. But for efforts at genuine peace to succeed, Western governments and multinational corporations need <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> region alone and let the indigenous Jews and Arabs settle things between ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1942, Gavin {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (505th PIR) at Fort Benning which had been activated shortly before on July 6. He was, aged just 35, promoted to colonel shortly thereafter. Gavin built this regiment from the ground up. He led his troops on long marches and realistic training sessions, creating the training missions himself and leading the marches personally. He also placed great value on having his officers [...] "the first out of the airplane door and the last in the chow line". This practice has continued to and with present-day U.S. airborne units. After months of training, Gavin had the regiment tested one last time:As we neared our time to leave, {{on the way to}} war, I had an exercise that required them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> barracks area at 7:00 P.M. and march all night to an area near the town of Cottonwood, Alabama, a march about 23 miles. There we maneuvered all day and in effect we seized and held an airhead. We broke up the exercise about 8:00 P.M. and started the troopers back by another route through dense pine forest, by way of backwoods roads. About 11:00 P.M., we went into bivouac. After about one hour's sleep, the troopers were awakened to resume the march. [...] In 36 hours the regiment had marched well over 50 miles, maneuvered and seized an airhead and defended it from counterattack while carrying full combat loads and living off reserve rations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore reasons behind Taiwanese nurses’ {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their job. Employing a qualitative approach, we examined the views of eight Taiwanese nurses to determine factors that lead to their intention <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> From <b>our</b> interview records, we identified that fulfilling employees’ needs, supervisor-subordinate relationship, co-worker interaction, and work atmosphere are the reasons that Taiwanese nurses believe to influence their intention <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the job. Based on our findings, we recommend healthcare administrators to provide the right services to their nursing staff in order to minimise nurses’ intention <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> We also suggest top management to strengthen collegiality among staff members...|$|R
