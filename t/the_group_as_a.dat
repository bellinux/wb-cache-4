5|$|As senior officer, Lamason {{had access}} to the main camp and quickly built a rapport with <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, he was able to secure extra blankets, clothes, clogs and food for the airmen. Lamason also built a rapport with two other prisoners; French {{scientist}} Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Ray Davies dived {{headlong into}} the {{theatrical}} style, {{beginning with the}} rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> theatrical troupe.|$|E

5|$|In general, apeomyines are a {{widespread}} but generally rare group of dentally distinctive eomyids with a tendency towards large size. Fejfar and colleagues suggested that apeomyines were ecologically distinct from other eomyids and probably preferred a drier habitat. Although other scientists recognized Apeomyinae as a subfamily, in a 2008 summary of North American eomyids, Lawrence Flynn placed <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tribe, Apeomyini, within the subfamily Eomyinae. Flynn described Apeomyoides {{as the most}} derived apeomyine.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} rock groups of the 21st Century, Queens of the Stone Age, has featured major contributions from various grunge musicians. Josh Homme had briefly played in Screaming Trees with off-and-on QOTSA member Mark Lanegan, before forming the group. Nirvana's Dave Grohl and Eleven's Alain Johannes have also provided notable contributions. Homme and Grohl joined with Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones to form the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures in 2009. Johannes also performed with <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> touring member.|$|E
5|$|The Native Americans that {{attacked}} the group {{were not part}} of Black Hawk's band of warriors but they were en route to join that group when the massacre occurred. Older histories described <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> band of Sac warriors while modern sources indicate that the band were associated with the Ho-Chunk nation. Black Hawk asserted that the group was Ho-Chunk and unaffiliated with his band in his autobiography.|$|E
50|$|During 1986 and 1987, Rosenberg {{worked with}} various other musicians to create {{original}} music. He chose the name Will to Power for <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> homage to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of an individual's fundamental will to power.|$|R

(1965) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and features <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> band of female techno-warriors, who use martial arts and high-tech ninja-influenced weapons to capture a hapless male. It includes symbols of male disempowerment, and serves as an example of solidarity and the group's bonding.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing {{on the influence of}} Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E

50|$|After {{the murder}} of his uncle Headman Shabalala in December 1991 and the {{retirement}} of several other members (Inos Phungula, Geophrey Mdletshe and Ben Shabalala), Joseph later recruited Thamsanqa and his brothers Sibongiseni, Thulani and Msizi. Thamsanqa began singing with <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alto voice (alongside Albert Mazibuko, who is a tenor voice) and has remained in the line-up since 1993.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a {{reported}} US$80million, {{at the time}} the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Rather Ripped is the 14th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} June 13, 2006, by Geffen Records. The record was the band's first album after the departure of multi-instrumentalist Jim O'Rourke, who joined <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fifth member in 1999. Unlike its immediate predecessors, Rather Ripped was produced by John Agnello and recorded at Sear Sound in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1994 album Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star was recorded. It also completed Sonic Youth's contract with Geffen, which released the band's previous eight records.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
5|$|The unranked group Isostylis, {{with its}} one species, was {{reclassified}} as a {{section in the}} 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, and 1870 arrangement of George Bentham. In his 1981 revision of the genus, Alex George reclassified <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subgenus—Banksia subg. Isostylis—defined by the dome-shaped flower heads, with B.ilicifolia joined by newly described species B.cuneata and later B.oligantha. Banksia ilicifolia is the only common member of that subgenus; the two other species are rare and threatened, and are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Relationships between B.ilicifolia {{and the other members}} of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Although DNA studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic divergence within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E
