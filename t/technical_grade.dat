25|$|In the US, glycine is {{typically}} sold in two grades: United States Pharmacopeia (“USP”), and <b>technical</b> <b>grade.</b> USP grade sales account for approximately 80 to 85 {{percent of the}} U.S. market for glycine. Where the customer’s purity requirements exceed the minimum required under the USP standard, for example for some pharmaceutical applications such as intravenous injections, pharmaceutical grade glycine, often produced to proprietary specifications and typically sold at a premium over USP grade glycine, may be used. <b>Technical</b> <b>grade</b> glycine, {{which may or may}} not meet USP grade standards, is sold at a lower price for use in industrial applications; e.g., as an agent in metal complexing and finishing.|$|E

25|$|Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is the {{compound}} with the chemical formula PH3. It is a colorless, flammable, toxic gas and pnictogen hydride. Pure phosphine is odorless, but <b>technical</b> <b>grade</b> samples have a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, {{due to the}} presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphane (P2H4). With traces of P2H4 present, PH3 is spontaneously flammable in air, burning with a luminous flame. Phosphines are also a group of organophosphorus compounds with the formula R3P (R = organic derivative). Organophosphines are important in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; complexes derived from a chiral phosphine can catalyze reactions to give chiral, enantioenriched products.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of bouldering, {{problems}} are assigned <b>technical</b> <b>grades</b> according to several established systems, which are often distinct from those used in roped climbing.

50|$|In the UK, {{the system}} known as UK <b>technical</b> <b>grades</b> is {{occasionally}} used to rate a boulder problem. These run from 4a to 7b with steps of a, b and c before changing the initial number. This system is applied because these <b>technical</b> <b>grades</b> {{are used in}} the UK grading system for trad routes to represent the absolute difficulty of the hardest move. UK <b>technical</b> <b>grades</b> were only designed to describe the difficulty of a single move making them unsuitable for grading boulders and V or Font grades are generally used instead.|$|R

25|$|In 1930 Carey {{was posted}} to No. 43 Squadron RAF based at RAF Tangmere near Chichester, West Sussex.

In 1935, after several applications, he was selected for pilot training. He was sent to No. 6 Flying Training School at Netheravon in Wiltshire. Little of Carey's flight training is known since his logbook was lost. Carey passed out as a Sergeant pilot, rejoining 43 Squadron, now flying the Hawker Fury. While in Wiltshire he met his first wife, Kathleen Ivy Steele. They were married at Winchester Registry office on 1 July 1936 and moved to a house in Arundel.|$|E
