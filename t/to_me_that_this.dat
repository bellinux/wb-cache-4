From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> music was as important to me as any music I've ever been involved in. It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist." [...] He repeated this point {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times.|$|E
500|$|September 5, 1942: In {{the morning}} {{attended}} a special {{action from the}} women's concentration camp (Muslims); the most dreadful of horrors. Master-Sergeant Thilo (troop doctor) was right when he said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the anus mundi. In the evening towards 8:00 attended another special action from Holland [...] Because of the special rations they get a fifth of a liter of schnapps, 5 cigarettes, 100 g salami and bread, the men all clamor {{to take part in}} such actions.

500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E

500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> has been done." [...] Within a month their needs were being met.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy. Post-production wrapped on November 25, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tarski has {{stressed}} in {{his lecture}} (and I think justly) the great {{importance of the}} concept of general recursiveness (or Turing's computability). It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> importance is largely {{due to the fact that}} with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen.*"(Gödel 1946 in Davis 1965:84).|$|E
2500|$|The {{driving force}} behind the GRA, and its Managing Director until the 1960s, was Brigadier-General Alfred Critchley who wrote in his {{autobiography}} that, when he first learned of greyhound racing, [...] "It immediately occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might prove to be the poor man's racecourse". Apparently his interest in how the lower paid classes were losing money by backing horses was born out of concern for his valet who lost large sums betting on horse racing.|$|E

De Forest decorated the spaces between the dark, exposed ceiling beams with decorative brass panels with East Indian patterns.

2500|$|Development on the Hurd {{began in}} 1990 after an {{abandoned}} kernel attempt in 1986, {{based on the}} research TRIX operating system developed by Professor Steve Ward and his group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). According to Thomas Bushnell, the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, [...] "It is now perfectly obvious <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would have succeeded splendidly and {{the world would be}} a very different place today". In 1987 Richard Stallman proposed using the Mach microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.|$|E

[...] Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill.

2500|$|RC's {{system of}} {{centralised}} control has been deprecated by ex-members {{who would have}} preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. It was clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L. Ron Hubbard.|$|E

Edwards stated, [...] "The way I tried to view it was to imagine Godzilla was a real creature and someone from Toho {{saw him in the}} 1950s and ran back to the studio to make a movie about the creature and was trying their best to remember it and draw it. And in our film you get to see him for real." [...] He {{went on to say that}} his Godzilla remains true to the original in all aspects. Edwards also stressed that, [...] "It was important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> felt like a Toho Godzilla" [...] and concluded by wishing, [...] "I'd love ours (Godzilla) to be considered as part of the Toho group." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's bedrest {{was over}} by late 1927, {{and she began}} socializing with her old school friends, who were now at {{university}} and involved in student politics. She joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM) and was introduced to a circle of political activists and artists — including the exiled Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella, and the Italian-American photographer Tina Modotti. At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most successful artists and a notable figure in PCM. They had met briefly in 1922, when he was painting a mural at her school. Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her {{to pursue a career}} as an artist. Rivera recalled being impressed by her works, stating that they showed, [...] "an unusual energy of expression, precise delineation of character, and true severity ... They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own ... It was obvious <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> girl was an authentic artist".|$|E
