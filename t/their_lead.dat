5|$|Anderlecht {{began the}} second half the better of the two sides as they pushed forward {{in an attempt to}} extend <b>their</b> <b>lead.</b> Rensenbrink, in particular, was in good form as he caused {{numerous}} problems for Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes, who started because of an injury to Phil Thompson after being absent himself for a lengthy period. Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an attempt {{to get back into the}} match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored. No further goals were scored and the referee Károly Palotai blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Anderlecht.|$|E

Ohio State opened the scoring {{early in the second}} quarter with a 33-yard field goal by Devin Barclay, and then added to <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> with a 7-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Dane Sanzenbacher. Michigan got their only points of the game a few minutes later with a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. Ohio State then proceeded to score 27 unanswered points and put the game out of reach. Immediately following the Michigan touchdown, Jordan Hall returned the kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Ohio State then added to <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> with a 33-yard reception by DeVier Posey. The Buckeyes had a chance to extend <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> {{at the end of the}} first half, but a Terrelle Pryor pass was intercepted by Jordan Kovacs in the Michigan endzone.

5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Alabama took a 3–0 lead {{early in}} the second quarter on a 25-yard Cade Foster field goal. On their next possession, the Crimson Tide scored their first touchdown on a two-play drive that saw a 42-yard Kevin Norwood reception and a one-yard Drake touchdown run for a 10–0 lead. Alabama then extended <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> to 24–0 at halftime after touchdown runs of 24-yards from Yeldon and one-yard from Drake on their final two possessions of the half.|$|E
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending <b>their</b> <b>lead</b> to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
