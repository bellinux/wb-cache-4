25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The Spinalis Dorsi originates on the fourth cervical vertebra and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the Trapezius. The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The Intercostal muscles begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its <b>traction</b> <b>force</b> aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. It spreads out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the nuchal ligament.|$|E
2500|$|Quantitatively, {{the stress}} is {{expressed}} by the Cauchy traction vector T defined as the <b>traction</b> <b>force</b> F between adjacent parts of the material across an imaginary separating surface S, divided by the area of S. In a fluid at rest the force is perpendicular to the surface, and is the familiar pressure. [...] In a solid, or in a flow of viscous liquid, the force F may not be perpendicular to S; hence the stress across a surface must be regarded a vector quantity, not a scalar. Moreover, the direction and magnitude generally depend on the orientation of S. [...] Thus the stress state of the material must be described by a tensor, called the (Cauchy) stress tensor; which is a linear function that relates the normal vector n of a surface S to the stress T across S. [...] With respect to any chosen coordinate system, the Cauchy stress tensor can be represented as a symmetric matrix of 3×3 real numbers. Even within a homogeneous body, the stress tensor may vary from place to place, and may change over time; therefore, the stress within a material is, in general, a time-varying tensor field.|$|E

It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the <b>traction</b> <b>force</b> (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E

The stiffness of a cell’s substrate and the available area on which it can spread {{can influence}} its generation of <b>traction</b> <b>forces,</b> but to what extent these factors are intertwined is unclear. In this study, we used microcontact printing and micropost arrays to control cell spreading, substrate stiffness, and post density to assess their effect on <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> and focal adhesions. We find that both the spread area and the substrate stiffness influence <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> in an independent manner, but these factors have opposite effects: cells on stiffer substrates produce higher average forces, whereas cells with larger spread areas generate lower average forces. We show that post density influences the generation of <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> {{in a manner that is}} more dominant than the effect of spread area. Additionally, we observe that focal adhesions respond to spread area, substrate stiffness, and post density in a manner that closely matches the trends seen for <b>traction</b> <b>forces.</b> This work supports the notion that <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> and focal adhesions have a close relationship in their response to mechanical cues...|$|R

Force transmission through newly formed contact sites is a highly dynamic process requiring a stable link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment. To simultaneously investigate cellular <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> in several individual maturing adhesion sites within the same cell, we established a custom-built multiple trap optical tweezers setup. Beads functionalized with fibronectin or RGD-peptides were placed onto the apical surface of a cell and trapped with a maximum force of 160 pN. Cells form adhesion contacts around the beads as demonstrated by vinculin accumulation and start to apply <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> after 30 seconds. Force transmission was found to strongly depend on bead size, surface density of integrin ligands and bead location on the cell surface. Highest <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> were measured for beads positioned on the leading edge. For mouse embryonic fibroblasts, <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> acting on single beads {{are in the range}} of 80 pN after 5 minutes. If two beads were positioned parallel to the leading edge and with a center-to-center distance less than 10 µm, <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> acting on single beads were reduced by 40 %. This indicates a spatial and temporal coordination of force development in closely related adhesion sites. We also used our setup to compare <b>traction</b> <b>forces,</b> retrograde transport velocities, and migration velocities between two cell lines (mouse melanoma and fibroblasts) and primary chick fibroblasts. We find that maximal force development differs considerably between the three cell types with the primary cells being the strongest. In addition, we observe a linear relation between force and retrograde transport velocity: a high retrograde transport velocity is associated with strong cellular <b>traction</b> <b>forces.</b> In contrast, migration velocity is inversely related to <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> and retrograde transport velocity...|$|R

There are currently few methods by which one can measure the <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> in a quantitative way, especially on the single-cell level; the most common method by which to study cells in vitro has been to use a polystyrene dish. However, the rigidity of the substrates {{makes it impossible to}} visualize cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces.</b> Thus, it has been difficult to quantitatively study the underlying mechanisms by which a cell generates <b>traction</b> <b>forces,</b> and how <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> can be modulated to promote normal development or halt disease progression.

50|$|The {{assembly}} of nascent focal adhesions is {{highly dependent on}} the process of retrograde actin flow. This is the phenomenon in a migrating cell where actin filaments polymerize at the leading edge and flow back towards the cell body. This is the source of traction required for migration; the focal adhesion acts as a molecular clutch when it tethers to the ECM and impedes the retrograde movement of actin, thus generating the pulling (<b>traction)</b> <b>force</b> {{at the site of the}} adhesion that is necessary for the cell to move forward. This traction can be visualized with <b>traction</b> <b>force</b> microscopy. A common metaphor to explain actin retrograde flow is a large number of people being washed downriver, and as they do so, some of them hang on to rocks and branches along the bank to stop their downriver motion. Thus, a pulling force is generated onto the rock or branch that they are hanging on to. These forces are necessary for the successful assembly, growth, and maturation of focal adhesions.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{mathematical}} model describing gel contraction is derived and studied. The mathematical model describes the process where cells are compressing the gel, and the model is therefore used to study the cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces,</b> in for example cancer cells. In order for the cells to leave the primary tumor and invade through the tissue and extracellular matrix towards {{other parts of the}} body, they need to extract forces. These forces are studied using the mathematical model, which is derived in this thesis. The main equations used when deriving the mathematical model are the mass balance equations for the gel and cells, together with the momentum balance equation. In order to solve the mass balance equation, equations describing the force exerted by the cells on the gel and an equation describing the evolution of cell-produced chemicals are included, together with several initial and boundary conditions. The different equations needed in the numerical simulations are then converted into a new coordinate system to make the computations easier, before the equations are discretized. The mathematical models include seven different parameters which were investigated. During the numerical simulations, the parameters were altered to see how they affected the cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces.</b> The results were that the contact inhibition parameter, bulk viscosity, proportionality constant for the chemical flux out of the gel and decay rate of the cell-produced chemicals should be high, while the isothermal compressibility, the parameter describing cell traction and preferred density should be low in order to obtain low cancer cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces.</b> The numerical results were compared with experimental data. It was seen that both the numerical results from the mathematical model and the experimental results gave very similar shapes of the graphs representing gel radius over time (which {{is a measure of the}} cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces),</b> together with similar end values of the gel radius as well. It was therefore concluded that the mathematical model is representing the cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> in a satisfactory manner, and can therefore be used in further investigations of cancer cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> in the future. Towards the end of the thesis, cancer metastases was investigated. It was then seen from an experimental paper that an increased stiffness of the collagen gel decreased the possibility of cancer metastases. A high stiffness corresponds to a low isothermal compressibility, which can be accomplished by for instance decreasing the temperature in the collagen gel or increasing the pressure. The relationship between the cancer cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> and metastases were also investigated, using different papers. The logical conclusion would be that an increase of the cancer cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> would increase the degree of metastases, since the cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> are needed in order for the cancer cells to move from the primary tumor to other parts of the body. This is also what is the most common conclusion, and what can be concluded from the results in an experimental paper. However, the results from another experimental paper give the opposite conclusion, which means that the relationship between cancer cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> and cancer metastases might not be as straightforward as one might think. Future experiments should therefore be conducted on the relationship between the size of cancer cell <b>traction</b> <b>forces</b> and cancer metastases...|$|R
