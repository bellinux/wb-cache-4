40|$|Wild black cherry, {{mountain}} black cherry, rum cherry Uses Black cherry wood {{is a rich}} reddish-brown {{color and}} is strong, hard, and close-grained – {{one of the most}} valued cabinet and furniture woods in North America. It is also used for paneling, interior <b>trim,</b> <b>veneers,</b> handles, crafts, toys, and scientific instruments. Black cherry is used for reclamation of surface mine spoil. Plant Guide The fruit has been used to flavor rum and brandy (“cherry bounce”). Pitted fruits are edible and are eaten raw and used in wine and jelly. Black cherry fruits are important food for numerous species of passerine birds, game birds, and mammals, including the red fox, black bear, raccoon, opossum, squirrels, and rabbits...|$|R
50|$|Bentley has officially {{confirmed}} the 2017 Bentayga will be Bentley's first production plug-in hybrid, while company executives have stated in interviews that the Bentayga would {{also get a}} diesel engine. As previewed by the Bentley Mulsanne Hybrid concept car, {{as well as the}} Bentley EXP 10 Speed Six concept, the plug-in hybrid will likely have copper accents and <b>trim</b> along the <b>veneers</b> in the interior and {{on the outside of the}} vehicle; as well as copper-colour contrast stitching in the interior.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 December 1986, Maserati's 60th anniversary {{as a car}} manufacturer, De Tomaso {{presented}} the Maserati Royale in Modena, a built-to-order, ultra-luxury version of the Quattroporte. It featured a higher compression 4.9-litre engine, putting out [...] Besides the usual leather upholstery and <b>veneer</b> <b>trim,</b> the passenger compartment featured a revised dashboard with analogue clock, four electrically adjustable seats, retractable veneered tables in the rear doors, and a mini-bar. Visually, the Royale was distinguished by new disc-shaped alloy wheels and silver-coloured side sills. De Tomaso announced a limited run of 120 Royales, but when production ceased in 1990 only 53 {{of them had been}} made.|$|R
5000|$|The Bonneville {{differed}} from its lesser Catalina and Star Chief counterparts by featuring more luxurious interior trim with upgraded cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide upholstery in sedans and coupes, expanded Morrokide in Safari wagons and genuine leather seating in convertibles. Bonnevilles (with {{the exception of}} Bonneville Safari station wagons) were also (along with Star Chiefs) built on a longer wheelbase version of GM's B-Body. Also found in the Bonneville were instrument panels and door panels with walnut <b>veneer</b> <b>trim,</b> carpeted lower door panels, grab bar {{on the passenger side}} of the dash and courtesy lights and a rear arm rest. Beginning in 1964, a Bonneville Brougham option package was available that included an even more luxurious interior trim level with front and rear seats featuring center armrests, upgraded door panels and a standard Cordova (vinyl) roof with [...] "Brougham" [...] nameplates. The two-door hardtop was marketed as the [...] "Sports Coupe", the four door pillarless models were called [...] "Vistas".|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} stands {{three stories}} tall and has 57000 sq ft of floorspace. [...] It is constructed of granite, limestone, slate, and copper, which {{is intended to}} match the older buildings on campus. [...] The tower element {{on the left side}} of the building is intended to match the most prominent building on campus, Old Main. [...] The 30-degree bend at one end created a [...] "cornerstone" [...] effect on the campus' northeast property line. [...] A false chimney houses mechanical equipment. [...] The entrance plaza includes a fountain and a grassed bowl area in the lower plaza. [...] The interior of the Burnett Center consists of cherry wood <b>trim</b> and doors, <b>veneer</b> plaster, wool carpet, and cove lighting. [...] The railings include cast iron fleur-de-lis balusters from Hays Hall, the first dormitory on campus that was demolished in 1994. [...] The first floor has atrium spaces and a main staircase. [...] The large vertical ribbon window assemblies provide a view of the rest of campus.|$|R
5000|$|Comfort and {{convenience}} features {{range from a}} 16-way adjustable heated and cooled driver seat to a rear cabin with power reclining memory seats, a cool box, and five powered sunshades. Certain versions of the LS can be equipped with climate control features such as first automobile ceiling air diffusers, air purifiers, air ionisers, and four-zone climate control with infrared body temperature sensors. The leather on the seats and steering wheel are made smoother than previous models, due to being buffed longer in production, the steering wheel is buffed for three hours and incorporates a whip stitching pattern. Upgraded materials (such as a headliner made out of ecsaine, a suede-like material used by couturier Yves Saint-Laurent) are offered for the interior. Inside the wood <b>veneer</b> <b>trim</b> has been laminated to aluminum instead of fiberglass by Yamaha's piano craftsmen. A special-order [...] "Executive" [...] seating package on long wheelbase models includes a rear seat DVD entertainment system with ceiling fold-down LCD screen, fixed center console with a swivel tray table, and a passenger-side shiatsu and shoulder massaging ottoman seat.|$|R
2500|$|The GTO {{became a}} {{separate}} Pontiac model (model number 242) in 1966, {{instead of being}} an [...] "option package" [...] on the Tempest LeMans. The entire GM [...] "A" [...] body intermediate line was restyled that year, gaining more curvaceous styling with kicked-up rear fender lines for a [...] "Coke-bottle" [...] look, and a slightly [...] "tunneled" [...] backlight. The tail light featured a rare louvered cover, only seen on the GTO. Overall length grew only fractionally, to , still on a [...] wheelbase, while width expanded to [...] Rear track increased one inch (2.5cm). Overall weight remained about the same. The GTO was available as a pillared coupe, a hardtop (without B-pillars), and a convertible. Also an automotive industry first, plastic front grilles replaced the pot metal and aluminum versions seen on earlier years. New Strato bucket seats were introduced with higher and thinner seat backs and contoured cushions for added comfort and adjustable headrests were introduced as a new option. The instrument panel was redesigned and more integrated than in previous years with the ignition switch moved from the far left of the dash {{to the right of}} the steering wheel. Four pod instruments continued, and the GTO's dash was highlighted by walnut <b>veneer</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|R
40|$|The forest-products {{industries}} {{are most important}} {{to the state of}} Oregon. Oregon leads the nation in the production of plywood, lumber, and particle board. More than half of softwood plywood production in the United States came from Oregon {{at the time of this}} survey, and more than a fifth of the lumber and about a third of the particle board were produced in Oregon. Over 90 percent of the logs harvested in the state at the time of this survey were destined for sawmills and plywood plants. In producing lumber and plywood from logs, less than half of the entering log volume emerges as the finished primary product. That portion of the log remaining consists of such items as bark, sawdust, shavings, slabs; <b>veneer</b> <b>trim,</b> plywop-dArim, cores, and sander dust. This portion that remains after primary manufacture frequently is called residue. f Ouch of this residue formerly was considered waste and usually was disposed of by burning. But now a large portion of this residue material is recovered for other uses-primarily as raw material for paper and wood-composition board manufacture. If residue is not used, it presents a problem of disposal within allowable limits of pollution ! Because these residue materials are a valuable raw material, we conducted a survey of virtually all sawmills and plywood plants in the state to determine how these residues were being used; to point out what quantities might be available for future use; and to note the changes that had occurred in residue usage since previous surveys. An additional objective was to obtain information on a material balance' for sawmill and plywood plants, so that conversion factors could be developed for estimating average quantities of different types of residue generated from a given production of lumber or plywood. From these conversion factors, the average amount of a given type of residue that might be expected in producing a given board footage of lumber or a given square footage of plywood can be estimated...|$|R
