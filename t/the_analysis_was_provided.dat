Support to <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> by the St Andrews Bioinformatics Unit funded by the Wellcome Trust [grant 097831 /Z/ 11 /Z]. Twin studies indicate that dyscalculia (or mathematical disability) is caused partly by a genetic component, which is yet to be understood at the molecular level. Recently, a coding variant (rs 133885) in the myosin- 18 B gene was shown to be associated with mathematical abilities with a specific effect among children with dyslexia. This association represents {{one of the most significant}} genetic associations reported to date for mathematical abilities and the only one reaching genome-wide statistical significance. We conducted a replication study in different cohorts to assess the effect of rs 133885 maths-related measures. The study was conducted primarily using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), (N[*]=[*] 3819). We tested additional cohorts including the York Cohort, the Specific Language Impairment Consortium (SLIC) cohort and the Raine Cohort, and stratified them for a definition of dyslexia whenever possible. We did not observe any associations between rs 133885 in myosin- 18 B and mathematical abilities among individuals with dyslexia or in the general population. Our results suggest that the myosin- 18 B variant is unlikely to be a main factor contributing to mathematical abilities. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Reported {{first aid}} application, {{frequency}} and practices {{around the world}} vary greatly. Based primarily on animal and observational studies, first aid after a burn injury {{is considered to be}} integral in reducing scar and infection, and the need for surgery. The current recommendation for optimum first aid after burn is water cooling for 20 minutes within three hours. However, compliance with this guideline is reported as poor to moderate at best and evidence exists to suggest that overcooling can be detrimental. This prospective cohort study of a binational burn patient registry examined data collected between 2009 and 2012. The aim {{of the study was to}} quantify the magnitude of effects of water cooling first aid after burn on indicators of burn severity in a large human cohort. Method: The data for <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> by the Burn Registry of Australia and New Zealand (BRANZ). The application of first aid cooling prior to admission to a dedicated burn service, was analysed for its influence on four outcomes related to injury severity.

Robust regression analysis using bootstrapped estimation adjusted using a propensity score was used to control for confounding and to estimate the strength of association with first aid. Dose-response relationships were examined to determine associations with duration of first aid. The influence of covariates on the impact of first aid was assessed.

As an ion-atom converter the target plate made of refractory metal (Ta or W) is proposed to be used. This target plate can withstand the energy flux transported by the divertor plasma during LHD pulse: ~ 10 MW/m^ 2 for ~ 2 s with water cooling. The particle brightness of such target is much higher than the one of a gas target with a reasonable value of molecular hydrogen density (10 ^ 14 cm^- 3). The efficiency of W-made ion reflected atom converter is rather high, 40 - 65 % in the incident ion energy range 50 - 1000 eV, however the energy reflection coefficient is lower for these energies: ~ 20 - 40 eV. Beside, the appearing the carbon or boron film on the target surface can lead to the decrease of ion-atom conversion efficiency. In such conditions the use of a time-of-flight (t-o-f) atom analyzer has some advantages as compare to the device with the gas stripping cell for charge exchange atom-ion conversion and electrostatic analysis of the ion energy distribution. In this paper we give the short description of energy component of the scheme with t-o-f atom analyzer in use, and the estimation of atom fluxes into the direction of atom analyzer with metal and gas targets. ...|$|E

The term "unrealistic " means the physical occurence is not possible. The term "overly conservative " is meant to signify the impact of combining conservative estimates together. The results of the PG&E review indicate that the NRC ASP analysis has provided an overly conservative, unrealistic evaluation of the significance of the event, as measured by the CCDP, due to the use of: * generic and overly conservative failure probabilities (random and common cause failures) for the emergency diesel generators (EDGs), * generic and overly conservative core uncovery time estimates, * an unrealistic mission time for the EDGs, and * an unrealistic treatment of the pressurizer power-operated relief valve challenge.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the problem}} of leisure time in local communities on the islands of the Zadar Archipelago (Iž, Dugi Otok, Ugljan). The model for <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> by an empirical survey carried out on the population of three Zadar islands in autumn 2001. In researching the migration dilemmas of the young population on the three Zadar islands, the methods used were a questionnaire and interviews (essays written by pupils). The questionnaire contained 39 questions, with possible answers provided in regard to important segments of island issues {{and the way in}} which young islanders perceived them. The questionnaire was filled out by 107 elementary and secondary school pupils from Ugljan, Iž and Dugi Otok. The following independent variables were used in the analysis of the empirical material: school (elementary – secondary), island of residence (Ugljan – Dugi Otok – Iž) and gender (male – female). Leisure time is a pressing issue for people in the (post) modern epoch. How should it be utiilsed and how can one utilise it without becoming a passive recipient of exterior content, and thus an object of manipulation of powerful groups, from political groups to economical ones? Play, as a form of self-realisation in opposition to mass-media messages and contents, becomes, in this sense, one of the best solutions in utilising leisure time. This applies especially to the young population. The research results confirm that most pupils, despite their obligations (school and extra-school obligations, travelling) have sufficient leisure time. Elementary school pupils are less burdened by obligations and have more leisure time. The situation is different for secondary school pupils, whose burdens and duties already significantly reduce time for play, entertainment and relaxation. The main reasons for a lack of leisure time in both groups are school obligations. The ways of spending leisure time are quite various; however passive forms (watching TV programmes, listening to music) predominate. Modern and even post-modern communication forms are already present even on the islands. Pupils spend their time behind various technological devices that create virtual reality. The scarcity of young people on the islands, together with the civilisational trend in this sphere, only increases the presence of passive forms of spending leisure time...|$|E

According to the author, organization of material supplies for the construction sector may be improved by creating a rational system of supply ties between industrial companies working for this sector and consumers of bulling materials i. e. construction companies. Various research methods were employed. Analysis of building materials and components flows, using inter-branch flows method, was linked with qualitative analysis of effectiveness with regard to the mechanism of functioning of the ties. The base material for <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> by interviews. In analysis of profitability of these ties there was applied index analysis. The studies produced a very rich Material. Proposals of current and perspective organizational improvements, which determine rational character of ties in industrial supplies between construction and industrial companies were put forward as well. The list of current improvements encompassed such improvements which could be Introduced at once without any investments, and without any material and financial allocations. Variant No. 1 of improvements of perspective character (feasible in conditions of the seller's market) anticipates that the supply system of construction companies will be based on functioning of regional organizations acting as middlemen in distribution of building materials. Such an organization should become the main supplier of building materials and components for numerous construction companies operating within a given region, aid it should also be charged with balancing of demand for construction materials with their supply capacities within the region (supervised by local authorities). Variant No. 2 (feasible in conditions of materials balance in the economy and in conditions of the parametric system operation) envisages introduction of cooperation-type links between supplier and the consumer. Deliveries would be effected on the basic of long-term agreements on cooperation. The parametric management system should encourage enterprises then to selection of the beat contracting parties in trade in materials. The system of centrally steered distribution and complex supply procedures would be replaced by horizontal agreements concluded between independent companies.

40|$|The {{basis for}} <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> by bone {{materials}} {{dating back to}} second half of 13 th century from a cemetery near the old town of Raciąż. Complete excavation included 67 persons, in this number 19 men, 14 women, and 34 children. The study was aimed at anthropological-demographic reconstruction of the local medieval population at Raciąż. This approach was possible owing to full exploration of the cemetery and strictly defined period during which it was used. Demographic analysis allowed to state that there appeared strong selection pressures in the examined human sample. These concerned mainly chiildren and grown up people in reproduction stage. The discovered structure of the dying age is characteristic for majority of non-maltusian populations. The average family size in the examined local group was fixed at 7 to 5 persons. In this number there were distinguished two persons with parental status, 4 to 5 children, and one person with grandfather’s or grandmother’s status. An average number o f the permanent town’s inhabitants at the given moment of time was estimated at 37 people. Anthropological analysis points at ethnogenetic connections between the analyzed population and north-west group (a considerable proportion of the Nordic component). Simultaneou ly there is observed a considerable portion of admixtues of the yellow race (especially hill element - q) in the racial composition. They were characteristic for the then Polish populations. As regards physical development, there prevailed among Raciąż population rmedium-size and tall type persons. It is also interesting that among tall persons women prevail. This fact may testify {{that the level of}} widely-understood living conditions was not favourable enough for the population. Such situation is usually manifested by a certain decrease in men’s height of body. The assessment of state of health was performed {{from the point of view}} of paleopathological changes in bones. It was discovered that most common were diseases in masticatory system and diseases of inflammation type e. g. arthritis chronica.

Dyslexia is a specific impairment in learning to read and has strong heritability. An intronic deletion within the DCDC 2 gene, with ~ 8 % frequency in European populations, is increasingly used as a marker for dyslexia in neuroimaging and behavioural studies. At a mechanistic level, this deletion has been proposed to influence sensory processing capacity, and in particular sensitivity to visual coherent motion. Our re-assessment of the literature, however, did not reveal strong support for a role of this specific deletion in dyslexia. We also analysed data from five distinct cohorts, enriched for individuals with dyslexia, and did not identify any signal indicative of associations for the DCDC 2 deletion with reading-related measures including in a combined samples (N = 526). We conducted the first replication analysis for a proposed deletion effect on visual motion perception and found no association (N = 445 siblings). We also report that the DCDC 2 deletion has a frequency of 37. 6 % in a cohort representative of the general population recruited in Hong Kong (N = 220). This figure, together with a lack of association between the deletion and reading abilities in this cohort, indicates the low likelihood of a direct deletion effect on reading skills. Therefore, on the basis of multiple strands of evidence, we conclude that the DCDC 2 deletion is not a strong risk factor for dyslexia. Our analyses and literature re-evaluation are important for interpreting current developments within multidisciplinary studies of dyslexia and, more generally, contribute to current discussions about the importance of reproducibility in science.

Background: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, observed in 5 - 10 % of children. Family and twin studies suggest a strong genetic component, but relatively few candidate genes have been reported to date. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) described the first statistically significant association specifically for a SLI cohort between a missense variant (rs 4280164) in the NOP 9 gene and language-related phenotypes under a parent-of-origin model. Replications of these findings are particularly challenging because the availability of parental DNA is required. Methods: We used two independent family-based cohorts characterised with reading- and language-related traits: a longitudinal cohort (n = 106 informative families) including children with language and reading difficulties and a nuclear family cohort (n = 264 families) selected for dyslexia. Results: We observed association with languagerelated measures when modelling for parent-of-origin effects at the NOP 9 locus in both cohorts: minimum P = 0. 001 for phonological awareness with a paternal effect in the first cohort and minimum P = 0. 0004 for irregular word reading with a maternal effect in the second cohort. Allelic and parental trends were not consistent when compared to the original study. Conclusions: A parent-of-origin effect at this locus was detected in both cohorts, albeit with different trends. These findings contribute in interpreting the original GWAS report and support further investigations of the NOP 9 locus and its role in language-related traits. A systematic evaluation of parent-of-origin effects in genetic association studies has the potential to reveal novel mechanisms underlying complex traits. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

Cooling was provided before Burn Centre admission for 68 % of patients, with at least twenty minutes duration for 46 %. The results indicated a reduction in burn injury severity associated with first aid. Patients probability for graft surgery fell by 0. 070 from 0. 537 (13 % reduction) (p = 0. 014). The probability for ICU admission fell by 0. 084 from 0. 175 (48 % reduction) (p< 0. 001) and hospital length of stay (LOS) fell by 2. 27 days from 12. 9 days (18 % reduction) (p = 0. 001). All outcomes except death showed a dose-response relationship with the duration of first aid. The size of burn and age interacted with many of the relationships between first aid and outcome and these are described and discussed. This study suggests that there are significant patient and health system benefits from cooling water first aid, particularly if applied for up to 20 minutes. The results of this study estimate the effect size of post-burn first aid and confirm that efforts to promote first aid knowledge are not only warranted, but provide potential cost savings...|$|E
40|$|Social media {{technologies}} today play {{a central}} part in our societies at large, but also within organizations. As such, it is both of relevance and importance {{to look at how}} organizations use social media technologies. Presented as a case within this larger topic, this study aimed at researching an international NGO startup’s use of social media technology – more specifically, by doing a discursive analysis on the organizational use of the term term ‘corruption’ on Twitter. Chapter 1 : Introduction elaborates more on this. In Chapter 2 and 3 a context through which to interpret any findings within <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>provided,</b> firstly by taking {{a closer look at the}} featured organization, Anti Corruption International, followed by a global context in which the organization operates within, namely that of a globalizing world. The type of organization that Anti Corruption International can be defined as was then looked at, thus providing an overview of some of the features characterizing international NGO startups. This overview is followed by a presentation of the global problem that the organization is working towards eradicating, namely that of ‘corruption’ which also happens to be the term investigated in the discursive analysis of the organization’s use of the said term on Twitter. Following this came a presentation of some perspectives on reasons as to why organizations might use social media technologies. With this context in mind, the discursive analysis was conducted assisted by the social media capturing software, Chorus. The software which is designed to capture Twitter discourse, provided a visual analysis of some structural patterns that the programme could observe within the dataset collected. The programme showed some terms to be co-occuring more strongly with the term ‘corruption’ than other terms. What could be interpreted by this, was that not only did the organization use the term ‘corruption’ on Twitter as a means of broadcasting information and encouraging for social interaction with its target group (a young, international audience), it could also be interpreted as to show that the organization used the term ‘corruption’ in order to call for action by joining the organization and its cause. Furthermore, the co-occurring terms also made for an interpretation of the organization using the term ‘corruption’ in a manner that re-produced itself as an entity, by constructing its identity as an anti-corruption organization working towards the eradication of corruption. The reasons as to why this particular research topic was chosen mainly had to do with this particular topic being regarded as valuable to the organization, seeing as no prior research had been done concerning the organization’s use of social media technologies broadly, or the organization’s use of the significant term ‘corruption’ more specifically. As such, the aim of this research was to provide the organization with some insights into a segment of its social media practices – insights that the organization could build on and apply in order to fill the slightly innocent, yet oblivious void that the organization finds itself within due to a deficiency of knowledge and insight concerning its current use of social media technologies. For fledgling organizations and sustainable organizations alike, unawareness concerning the organization’s use of social media technologies is not exactly seen as to be beneficial to the organization, seeing as social media technologies can impact organizations in unforeseeable ways. Thus, this study might serve to address a segment within the knowledge gap that exists within the featured organization concerning its use of social media technologies. The interpretations made within the study might serve to create the basis for further studies to be carried out by the organization itself on this particular topic. Additionally, comprehensions of social media practices within organizations such as international NGO startups, even small segments of their use, serves to identify trends in usage, which further serves to provide an understanding of how new technologies such as these can be leveraged to fulfill the global objectives of an international NGO startup, and at large, providing a deeper understanding of the purpose of using social media technologies within organizations...|$|E
