5|$|Dodd's {{career was}} busiest in the 1980s, and by 1985 it was {{reported}} that he had acted in 55 movies or television features. In 1981 he played Billy Snakeskin in the film Gallipoli, about the fate of young men who participated in the World War I Gallipoli Campaign of 1915. This was followed by parts in Chase <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> <b>and</b> Essington, both in 1984. In 1985 he played the role of Mr Joe in The Coca-Cola Kid, an Australian romantic comedy with an international cast including Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi. In 1986 he appeared in the film Short Changed, while through the mid-1980s he had minor parts in the popular television series The Flying Doctors (1985–1988).|$|E
5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron all <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{in the way}} of Okabe's advance was A Company of the 2/6th Infantry Battalion under Captain W. H. Sherlock. Okabe {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Sherlock's {{position}} on 28 January. Sherlock was forced from his position and retreated onto a nearby spur. For much of the afternoon, frontal Japanese attacks were repelled by Australian mortar and machine gun fire, and efforts to infiltrate Sherlock's positions were defeated by a bayonet attack led by Sherlock in person. By 18:00, Sherlock's mortar ammunition had run out and his small arms ammunition was running short, while his position was being plastered with mortar rounds and swept by machine gun fire. Sherlock held on <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> was killed the next day trying to break through the Japanese lines. For his actions, Sherlock was posthumously mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|Walsh {{was born}} in West Hoboken, New Jersey, which merged with Union Hill to become Union City in 1925. He joined the Civilian Military Training Corps at age 16, and the New Jersey Army National Guard in 1928. After graduating from Rutgers Law School, Walsh joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1934. Later that year, he {{discovered}} the body of gangster Baby Face Nelson, who died of injuries sustained in a gun battle with the police in Barrington, Illinois on November 27, 1934. Nelson had killed two FBI agents prior to fleeing the scene, wounded, and later died at his wife's side. The FBI, unaware of Nelson's death, continued a broad search for him, which included several home raids, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> into the following day. The search was not called off until a tip led them to Nelson's body, which was lying in a ditch {{in what is now}} Skokie, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The 2 RAR Machine Gun Platoon on Hill 111 again {{found itself}} heavily engaged, {{suffering}} five badly wounded. The Chinese {{had managed to}} establish an artillery forward observer on Hill 111 and US Marine casualties were particularly heavy as a result. Eight critically injured Americans were subsequently evacuated through 2 RAR for urgent medical treatment. Small-arms fire continued to be exchanged between the US Marines and the Chinese {{for the next two}} hours, only subsiding by 03:00, with the Marines finally driving out the Chinese. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently released and it returned to battalion's main defensive position. The Australian outpost section also succeeded in holding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> the following morning they found 35 Chinese dead around their positions. During the fighting Crockford had repeatedly exposed himself to Chinese fire, and had even run across no man's land to provide situation reports to the US Marine command post on Hill 111. He was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. By dawn the only activity in front of The Hook were Chinese stretcher bearers collecting their wounded, which were subsequently allowed to do so unmolested by the Australians. In the US 1st Marine Division's sector the fighting had also ceased, while small groups of Chinese moved to reinforce their positions and were engaged with rifle and machine-gun fire.|$|E

25|$|This two {{process model}} was first {{proposed}} in 1982 by Borbely, who called them Process S (homeostatic) and Process C (Circadian) respectively. He showed how the slow wave density increases <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> then drops {{off at the}} beginning of the day while the circadian rhythm is like a sinusoid. He proposed that the pressure to sleep was the maximum when the difference between the two was highest.|$|E

25|$|With {{numerous}} presidential hopefuls {{to choose}} from, Roosevelt supported Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, a colorless reformer. The state GOP preferred the incumbent president, New York City's Chester Arthur, {{who was known}} for passing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. Arthur, at the time, was suffering from Bright's disease, unknown to the public, and out of duty he did not contest his own nomination. Roosevelt fought hard and succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates at the state convention in Utica. He then {{took control of the}} state convention, bargaining <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> outmaneuvering the supporters of Arthur and James G.

25|$|As {{the guns}} fell silent at dusk in Navarino Bay, {{news of the}} outcome raced over the Peloponnese and {{to the rest of}} Greece. In village after village, church bells started a {{continuous}} peal in the night. People rushed into village squares, to be greeted by the news that the Ottoman Sultan and his hated vassal Ibrahim Pasha no longer possessed a Mediterranean fleet. In a maritime country like Greece, the implication was evident, that the fledgling Greek state was saved. Wild rejoicing broke out, and lasted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> for days after. Huge bonfires were lit on the mountaintops of the Peloponnese and Mt Parnassos in central Greece. Celebrations swept even the occupied regions, which the demoralised Ottoman garrisons made little effort to prevent.|$|E
25|$|Arizona's {{changing}} population also hurt Goldwater. The state's {{population had}} soared, {{and a huge}} portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, {{and he was on}} the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to absentee ballots, which were among the last to be counted. Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over Jimmy Carter in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Paramount studio head Robert Evans brought Polanski to America {{ostensibly to}} direct the film Downhill Racer, but told Polanski that {{he really wanted to}} him to read the horror novel Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin to see if a film could be made out of it. Polanski read it {{non-stop}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272-page screenplay for the film in slightly longer than three weeks. The film, Rosemary's Baby (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow), a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.|$|E
25|$|While {{cruising}} in {{the company}} of the 36-gun , on 16 April 1797, Pearl helped capture the 24-gun privateer, Incroyable. In March 1798, she sailed for the Leeward Islands via West Africa where on 24 April, she escaped from two French frigates. While passing through the Îles de Los, an archipelago off the coast of Guinea, Pearl discovered an enemy squadron comprising 4 large ships at anchor and a brig under sail. As she approached one of the French frigates hoisted her colours and opened fire. Forced to run between two frigates, Pearl engaged both as she passed then hove to, continuing to fire for a further hour before making off with one, or possibly both frigates in pursuit. The chase continued <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> all through the following day before Pearl managed to escape, and arrived at Sierra Leone on 27 April, where she was inspected for damage. She had been holed in several places, although all were above the waterline; her foretopgallant yard and fore yard had been shot away and a number of lower shrouds and other rigging had been cut through. In addition two of her carronades had been dismounted, causing the death of one man.|$|E
25|$|The first Tour de France {{was staged}} in 1903. The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, {{starting}} in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and Nantes {{before returning to}} Paris. Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Stages would go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again. But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most and only 15 competitors had entered. Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea. Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least 20km/h on all the stages, equivalent to what a rider would have expected to earn each day had he worked in a factory. He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day's winner at 3,000 francs. The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year. That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants– the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out– among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, some simply adventurous.|$|E
