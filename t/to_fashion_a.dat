5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

25|$|Bloom's {{critique}} of contemporary social movements {{at play in}} universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation. For Bloom, the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.|$|E
25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. We should see this failure, rather, as an aspect of his genius. He both was and was not a man of his time.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after months}} of discussions, it was not {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> compromise between the two views, but a majority of the League's governing board supported Roelofs's views. Mee could not accept the decision and resigned from the League. From time to time Roelofs supplied Bulteno with tables of the Stelo's current value but never disclosed his principles or calculation method. Mee himself could not work out the underlying value ratios used, although he assumed that they had been archived.|$|E

25|$|Henrique da Rocha Lima in 1916 then {{proved that}} the {{bacterium}} Rickettsia prowazekii was the agent responsible for typhus; he named it after H. T. Ricketts and Stanislaus von Prowazek, two zoologists who had died from typhus while investigating epidemics. Once these crucial facts were recognized, Rudolf Weigl in 1930 was able <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> practical and effective vaccine production method by grinding up the insides of infected lice that had been drinking blood. It was, however, very dangerous to produce, and carried a high likelihood of infection {{to those who were}} working on it.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of Rastafari groups is less {{like those of}} Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular {{structure of}} other African diasporic traditions like Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santeria, and Jamaica's Revival Zion. Since the 1970s, there have been attempts <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> pan-Rasta unity movement, namely through {{the establishment of the}} Rastafari Movement Association, which sought political mobilisation. In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in Toronto, Canada. This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.|$|E
25|$|Washington backed Renault Robinson, a black {{police officer}} {{and one of the}} founders of the Afro-American Patrolmen's League (AAPL). The aim of the AAPL was to fight racism {{directed}} against minority officers by the rest of the predominantly white department. Soon after the creation of the group, Robinson was written up for minor infractions, suspended, reinstated, and then placed on the graveyard shift to a single block behind central police headquarters. Robinson approached Washington <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> bill creating a civilian review board, consisting of both patrolmen and officers, to monitor police brutality. Both black independent and white liberal legislators refused to back the bill, afraid to challenge Daley's grip on the police force.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{continuity}} changes which followed The Man of Steel and Superman: Secret Origin, Luthor is shown actively participating {{in the creation of}} three Superman villains, Parasite (indirectly), Bizarro (the failed result of an attempt to clone Superman), and the cyborg Metallo. Upon discovering that Metallo is powered by a 'heart' of kryptonite rock in Superman vol. 2, #2, Luthor steals it in order <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> kryptonite ring for himself. He wears the alien ore around his finger as a symbol that he is untouchable, even to the Man of Steel, after carrying out a series of kidnappings to try to determine the nature of the connection between Superman and Clark Kent.|$|E
25|$|Bissell placed Droller {{in charge}} of liaising with anti-Castro {{segments}} of the Cuban-American community living in the United States, and asked Hunt <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> government-in-exile, which the CIA would effectively control. Hunt proceeded to travel to Havana, {{the capital city of}} Cuba, where he spoke with Cubans from various different backgrounds and discovered a brothel through the Mercedes-Benz agency. Returning to the US, he informed the Cuban-Americans with whom he was liaising {{that they would have to}} move their base of operations from Florida to Mexico City, because the State Department refused to permit the training of a militia on US soil. Although unhappy with the news, they conceded to the order.|$|E
25|$|News soon reaches The Nine that Alric's {{army has}} been destroyed, {{and he has}} been {{captured}} by The Deceiver. He was sent to The Barrier to search for a suit of enchanted armor by the Head, who now claims to have been an ally of Connacht, although some are beginning to doubt the veracity of its claims. A small group from The Legion fly over the mountains in a hot air balloon, and rescue Alric. The Legion is then ordered to Silvermines to look for The Watcher's arm, lost when Balor freed him from captivity beneath the Cloudspine, as The Nine believe the arm can be used <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> weapon to use against The Watcher. However, The Deceiver is also in Silvermines searching for the arm, as he and The Watcher were enemies before the rise of Balor. The Legion find the arm, but soon thereafter, a volcano erupts, melting the snow on the Cloudspine, and allowing The Deceiver to move west. At the same time, The Watcher attacks Rabican's army, crushing it. However, the army of The Deceiver, heading west, and the army of The Watcher, pursuing the remnants of Rabican's army east, begin to fight one another, with Maeldun using the distraction to retake the passes.|$|E

50|$|Unlike in {{the rest}} of Spain, the Industrial Revolution made some {{progress}} in Catalonia, whose pro-industry middle class strived to mechanize everything, from textiles and crafts to wineries.

25|$|Matters are {{complicated}} further {{with the arrival}} of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and the secret daughter of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (though Jessica herself is unaware of her parentage). Jessica is presented to Leto as a gift from the Bene Gesserit, although the sisterhood has the ulterior motive of using the pair in their breeding program. At first, Leto refuses to {{have much to do with}} Jessica and tries to remain faithful to Kailea. However, as he and Kailea grow farther apart, he begins to seek out Jessica's company. Finally, Kailea is driven to make an attempt on Leto's life by having an explosive device planted on his skyclipper. At the last minute, Leto decides to take Victor and Rhombur along with him, and the boy dies instead. Leto is relatively unharmed, but Rhombur is reduced to little more than a charred lump of flesh. Fearing that Leto will guess that she is responsible for the death of their son and driven by guilt, Kailea kills her lady-in-waiting and then commits suicide by jumping out a window. The Tleilaxu offer to grow a ghola of Leto's deceased son in exchange for the barely alive body of Rhombur Vernius. Leto ultimately refuses, after much soul-searching, knowing that the Tleilaxu intend only harm towards House Vernius. Instead, Leto hires Dr. Wellington Yueh, an expert in the field of cybernetics, <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> cybernetic replacement body for Rhombur. Leto and Jessica fall deeply in love, leading Jessica to decide to conceive a son for Leto's sake, directly disobeying the Bene Gesserit's order that she have a daughter.|$|E

He found the episodic nature of the work challenging but was able <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> cohesive screenplay by combining elements of the different stories present in the manga. Although he sent his script to Urushibara for review, she gave him complete creative autonomy. Otomo describes the film as [...] "a kind of fable", and as such, he chose the Meiji era as its setting because he felt it offered the best framing for the story. The sudden disappearances of certain characters were also consistent with the nature of that historical period.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist {{and band}} leader, Roger McGuinn, {{returned}} to the composition during a July 22, 1969 recording session for the band's Ballad of Easy Rider album. McGuinn decided {{to slow down the}} tempo and radically alter the song's arrangement <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> more somber and serious version than those recorded in 1965. In tandem with the slower tempo, the band dragged the syllables of each word out in order to emphasize the world-weariness of the song's lyric. Ultimately, McGuinn was dissatisfied with the recording of the song included on Ballad of Easy Rider, feeling that it tended to drag {{within the context of the}} album. In addition to appearing on Ballad of Easy Rider, The Byrds' 1969 recording of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] can also be found on the compilation albums The Byrds Play Dylan and The Very Best of The Byrds.|$|E

500|$|Contrary to {{her present}} style, M.I.A.'s Arular era style has been {{described}} as [...] "tattered hand me downs and patched T-shirts of indigents", embodying the [...] "uniform of the refugee" [...] but modified with cuts, alterations and colours <b>to</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>a</b> distinctly new style and apparel line. M.I.A. built on this during the Kala era with a [...] "playful" [...] combination of baggy T-shirts, leggings and short-shorts. She incorporated eccentric accessories in bold patterns, sparkle and [...] "over-saturated" [...] neon colour to fashion her signature style which inspired flocks of [...] "garishly-clothed all-too-sassy" [...] new-rave girls with bright red tights, cheetah-skin smock and faded 1980s T- shirts. Her commodifying and performance of this refugee image has been noted to [...] "reposition" [...] perceptions of it in the wider public. Hailed as presenting a challenge to the mainstream with her ironic style, M.I.A. has been praised for dictating such a subcultural trend worldwide, combining [...] "adolescent" [...] frustrations of race and class with a strong desire to dance. Eddy Lawrence of Time Out commented how her multi genre style contributed to her being beloved of the broadsheet fashionistas yet simultaneously patron saint and pin-up for the Day-Glo nu-rave kids. Similarly, Mary Beth Ray, in the book Rock Brands: Selling Sound in a Media Saturated Culture writes that M.I.A.'s hybrid style addressed a number of social and political issues including power, violence, identity and survival in a globalised world, while using avenues that challenged [...] "traditional" [...] definitions of {{what it meant to be}} a contemporary pop artist.|$|E
