40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This project involves background work on butt-welding of injection moulded polypropylene ASTM bars followed by a programme on the welding of extruded polypropylene strapping tape. In the butt-welding study, the effects of processing conditions of the bars, welding variables, and annealing treatments, on the morphology and strength of the welds, were investigated. Light and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used for}} the analysis of morphological structure and fracture surface texture. Tensile tests have been used to assess the weld strength either at room temperature and at sub-zero temperature. In the strapping tape programme the influence of the tape orientation and the welding temperature on weld efficiency was analysed. The orientation of the tapes, obtained by means of five different draw ratios in the manufacturing plant, was assessed by doing shrinkage and optical measurements. Shear and peeling tests have been used to study the weld efficiency. From the butt-welding study was concluded that the microstructure of the injection moulded bars affected the weld zone morphology. The annealing at l 52 degrees C before and after welding caused a reduction in weld strength. However the oriented zones were apparently unaffected by these thermal treatments. In that the strapping <b>tape</b> <b>welding</b> is concerned, an optimum welding tool temperature could be identified. The draw ratio of the tapes seems not to affect the optimum weld temperature, but it influences the efficiency of the welds...|$|E

40|$|Powder-coated tape {{electrodes}} (powder-coated tapes) {{are used}} for doped and composite alloys <b>welding.</b> Using powder-coated <b>tape</b> for <b>welding</b> of wear-resistant alloys is stipulated {{by a number of}} factors in comparison with using electrodes for manual arc welding, flux cored wires, sintered tapes etc. The main task of mechanized arc welding of composite materials is to keep the wear-resistant particles in their initial condition and to ensure the weld metal receives them in the quantity demanded...|$|R
40|$|Unidirectionally {{reinforced}} thermoplastic <b>tapes</b> were <b>welded</b> onto {{woven fabric}} reinforced laminates using a laser assisted tape placement process. A mandrel peel setup {{was used to}} quantify the interfacial fracture toughness between the tape and the laminate as a measure for <b>weld</b> strength. The <b>tape</b> placement process was compared to a conventional press molding process in terms of interfacial fracture toughness. The tape placed specimens were found to outperform the press molded specimens. Additional experiments were performed to investigate {{the influence of the}} degree of crystallinity and the process induced weld interface on the measured fracture toughnes...|$|R
40|$|The {{interrelation}} between process parameters, {{material properties}} and interlaminar bond strength is investigated for the laser assisted tape placement process. Unidirectionally carbon reinforced poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) <b>tapes</b> were <b>welded</b> onto carbon woven fabric reinforced PPS laminates. The laminate and tape temperature distribution was measured during the welding process. The mandrel peel test method {{was applied to}} quantify the bond strength. The experiments demonstrated that an excellent bond quality can be obtained at high velocities and low input power in case the laser is primarily aimed at the tape. For these settings, the tape temperature exceeds the laminate temperature, while the latter stays well below the melt temperature of the PP...|$|R
40|$|Criteria for {{choosing}} {{a way of}} supports restoration were: ecological compatibility, sufficient hardness, adhesive strength and cohesive resistance, operational properties, an opportunity to process a layer by cutting, and the minimal failure of supports coaxiality during welding. Restoration of root supports in blocks of cylinders has been realized by means of electrocontact welding with a sintered powder tape {{in the form of}} two semi-rings. The selected structures of a sintered powder <b>tape</b> after <b>welding</b> formed a rather technological layer satisfying to operational properties: adhesive strength and cohesive resistance > 10 kg/mm 2, hardness НV 200 … 230. The accelerated tests of restored diesel engines have shown that the operational resistance was increased in 2. 1 … 2. 5 times, in comparison with factory blocks. The developed environmentally appropriate technology may be successfully used to restore external and internal surfaces of other hull details...|$|R
40|$|In high {{performance}} waterproof clothing, seam <b>tape</b> and <b>welds</b> fail before {{other parts of}} the garment. This paper examines a method of sealing seams in which the needle waterproofs the holes it creates by sealing them with a film of a thickness governed by the Landau-Levich law. The equation governing Landau-Levich behavior is combined with equations describing hole geometry to develop a phase space describing the fluidic and geometric properties necessary to seal a hole. A manual proof of concept test is performed which demonstrates that the basic method works. The needle speed of a standard sewing machine is then measured as is the size of the hole made by a standard sewing machine needle. These values are then used to calculate the viscosity of a fluid that will satisfy the conditions described by the phase space. An adhesive with the calculated viscosity is made and is used on a test bed to seal holes made by a needle. Each individual hole is sealed and further tests show that the seals are waterproof. Both the proof of concept and test bed experiments confirm the theory and it is concluded that needle speed, film length, and viscosity are the variables that can be controlled to tune hole sealing. by Cole Houston.

40|$|PhDIsotropic {{polymers}} lack {{sufficient strength}} and stiffness for many engineering applications. In {{order to improve}} these properties polymers can be filled with structural reinforcements such as glass or natural fibres. However, current major trends focus on simple monocomponent systems {{in an effort to}} reduce costs and increase recyclability. Composite systems, by definition, must employ at least two phases with different material properties. With the introduction of careful processing routes, it has been proven possible to create a fibrous, two phase composite, in which both are polypropylene. Polypropylene can be melt spun and solid state drawn to give oriented tapes, and moduli of - 15 GPa and tensile strengths of - 550 MPa can be achieved. These tapes can then be oriented into sheets, either in the form of woven fabrics or unidirectional layers. These sheets form the reinforcing phase of a single polymer composite material. Such single polymer composites based on polyolefins can be produced by using a separate matrix impregnation route, but these are limited by relatively low volume fractions of reinforcement. Previous work executed at the University of Leeds showed that polymer fibres can be welded together by selective melting of the fibre exterior, but this method is limited by a small temperature processing window. By using polypropylene tapes co-extruded with a copolymer skin, {{it has been shown that}} such <b>tapes</b> can be <b>welded</b> together at temperatures far below the melting temperature of the tapes, thus ensuring that thermal relaxation of the highly oriented polymer does not occur. The temperature processing window can be widened further by constraining fibres during heating. The optimisation of the drawing and structure of these tapes, together with an investigation of the static and dynamic mechanical properties, impact resistance and interfacial properties of composites formed from these tapes, are investigated in this thesi...|$|R
