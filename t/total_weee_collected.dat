40|$|Waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (WEEE) reverse {{supply chain management}} has increasingly received much attention in last years given both the rapid increase of these wasted products and the huge target imposed by EU. Currently, the EU WEEE collection targets are 4 kg per capita and the EU collection average is 8 kg per capita, while recent source estimates that <b>Weee</b> <b>collected</b> kg per capita are expected to grow at a rate of 3 % to 5 % per year. The paper focuses on the reality of the Italian WEEE reverse supply chain within the theoretical frame of sustainability, green management and CSR. An illustrative analysis is presented on the Italian waste collecting system and the first results of a research project on the diverse effectiveness of the Weee system in different Italian regions are illustrated. It emerges that lagging regions are filling the gap and certain hypothesis are formulated. Some implications are drawn and conclusions are discusse...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Council Directive 2002 / 96 /EC on waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) {{marked the end}} of a long and complex process aimed at putting in place legislation to manage WEEE, one of eight priority waste streams identified by the European Union. Although the legislation is based on the premise of producer responsibility, many of the WEEE Directive’s provisions will have a downstream impact on other parties or individuals including commercial retailers, the waste management industry and Government representatives at the local, regional and National levels. The Directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure a minimum rate of separate collection of WEEE from private households and to ensure all <b>WEEE</b> is <b>collected</b> separately and managed in an environmentally sound manner. To this end, Member States must ensure producers meet specific targets for recovery and component, material and substance reuse and recycling. In order to calculate targets as well as track implementation generally, information on the quantities and categories of electrical and electronic equipment put on the market and <b>WEEE</b> <b>collected</b> and reused, recycled and recovered must be compiled and reported on a periodic basis. This is complicated by other provisions contained in the Directive, including the distinction of ten different categories of WEEE and different financing provisions depending on whether the WEEE originates from private households. The purpose of this thesis was to examine the information, record-keeping and reporting requirements associated with the pending implementation of the WEEE Directive in Ireland. A number o f important, if not critical considerations in the establishment of an effective WEEE reporting system have been identified, including several potentials for errors, omissions or duplications. Recommendations are provided to address some of the issues identified, as are suggestions for further work, including collective consideration of certain issues by relevant stakeholders. In light of the above, a relatively simple, albeit standardised regulatory reporting system is recommended. Attention should be focused on making and continuing improvements to existing waste statistics and the associated reporting systems and to increasing awareness of the WEEE Directive and waste reporting requirements, generally. Having a centralised reporting system and limiting the number of categories of WEEE for which detailed monitoring is required would greatly facilitate the compilation of data, although sampling exercises and compositional surveys would still be necessary. This requires the active engagement of public and private sector stakeholders at a National level...|$|R
40|$|The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{directive}} impacts retailers {{of electronic}} and electric equipment across the European Union. However, {{there are differences}} between solutions developed at country level. As a consideration of the various models of closed-loop supply chain can be valuable, this paper presents the implementation of the WEEE directive in the UK, concentrating on the role of retailers and cooperation with logistics providers in designing cost-effective and sustainable solution for electronic and electric waste. It is an important case, since the British model seems to be effective: According to BERR estimations, in 2007 in the UK, 7 kg of <b>WEEE</b> was <b>collected</b> per head of population, against a 4 kg target set by the EU...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the Italian {{collective}} {{system for the}} management of household Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and its evolution over time, following the European Directives on WEEE, which include the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). The analysis focuses on the technical and economic performance of WEEE compliance organisations (consortia), as they are the key players in the Italian EPR regime. Economic results have not usually been provided in previous studies, {{due to the lack of}} available data. This study overcomes this problem by accessing the financial statements for the years 2009 - 2014 of all consortia. The main conclusions of the study are: The Italian EPR system barely exceeded the technical target of the first WEEE Directive (4 kg per capita). Improvements are necessary to achieve the target set for 2019 by the Recast Directive. The economic performance of the Italian EPR regime improved significantly over time. The fees charged per tonne of <b>WEEE</b> <b>collected</b> decreased by almost 43 % from 652 Euro per tonne in 2009 to 374 Euro per tonne in 2014, while the fees per tonne put on the market (P 0 M) were 134 Euro in 2009 and 104 Euro in 2014. The results prove the theory which states that, competing consortia use the learning effects to reduce the contribution fees for producers rather than to increase the quantity collected. Municipalities remain the most important actor in WEEE collection operations. Consortia compensate municipalities with a reimbursement that ranges between 28 and 38 Euros per tonne collected. These repayments cover only partially their costs. Additional studies should investigate their role...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} regulations, {{recycling}} {{and treatment of}} WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) in China. An online survey about Chinese households’ treatment of WEEE is conducted. Optimization models are {{used to compare the}} performances of WEEE treatment in two different recycling networks. In the first network, <b>WEEE</b> is <b>collected</b> and sent by recycling stations to licensed WEEE recycling and treatment centers for testing and dismantling. In the second network, WEEE are tested and dismantled at small recycling workshops in residential districts, and then parts/components that require further processing are sent to licensed WEEE recycling and treatment centers. The performances of the two networks are analyzed with linear programming models. The results indicate that the second model is more effective with lower cost and higher recycling efficiency.

40|$|Waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (WEEE) {{is known as}} an important source of secondary raw materials. Since decades, its treatment allowed to recover great amounts of basic resources. However, the management of electronic components embedded in WEEE still presents many challenges. The purpose of the paper is to cope with some of these challenges through the definition of an economic model able to identify the presence of profitability within the recovery process of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). To this aim, a set of common economic indexes is used within the paper. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on a set of critical variables is conducted to evaluate their impact on the results. Finally, the combination of predicted <b>WEEE</b> volumes (<b>collected</b> during the 2015 – 2030 period) in three European countries (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) and related economic indexes quantify the potential advantage coming from the recovery of this kind of waste in the next future...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of European Union’s directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) causes essential {{changes in the}} field of electronic scrap recycling. In Finland the new legislation was put in force in August 2005. The aim of the study is to discuss the problems of WEEE logistics considering the requirements of WEEE directive. This paper first describes the requirements of the legislation and the current situation of recycling management in Finland. The case study presents how collection of WEEE has been organised in Northern Finland. The problems and challenges of collection phases are discussed and an optimal model for the future is presented. The results prove that logistical costs are high and there are unnecessary handling and transportation stages in the current reverse supply chain of WEEE. The study also shows that legislation constraints, diverse characteristics and reuse value of EEE have an important impact on the strategic priorities of the future reverse logistics system of WEEE. The real challenge of collection lies in ensuring that <b>WEEE</b> is <b>collected</b> separately so that reusable equipment are separated from non-reusable ones...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some data}} regarding waste electrical and electronic (WEEE) management {{in one of}} the founding countries of the EU, Italy, and in a recent entry into the EU, Romania. The aim of this research was to analyze some problems that countries entering the EU will have to solve with respect to WEEE management. The experiences of Italy and Romania could provide an interesting reference point. The strengths and weaknesses that the two EU countries have encountered can be used in order to give a more rational plan for other countries. In Italy the increase of WEEE collection was achieved in parallel with the increase of the efficiency of selective Municipal Solid Waste collection. In Romania, pilot experiences were useful to increase the awareness of the population. The different interests of the two populations towards recyclable waste led to a different scenario: in Romania all types of <b>WEEE</b> have been <b>collected</b> since the entrance into the EU; in Italy the "interest" in recycling is typically related to large household appliances, with a secondary role of lighting equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of precious metals through hydrometallurgical techniques {{is one of}} the most active research areas on {{recovery of}} metals from electronic scraps. In this perspective, a pilot plant was designed for the treatment of small WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) via hydrometallurgy. The process is based on two different leaching steps, in nitric acid and in aqua regia, followed by electrodeposition processes, to mainly recover copper, silver and gold. Two adsorption steps were also carried out to recover nickel and tin. The goal of the present study is to assess the environmental impacts associated with the designed hydrometallurgical treatment of the small WEEE through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The approach considered is cradle-to-gate, i. e., from the <b>collected</b> <b>WEEE</b> entering the collection centre to the secondary metals obtained from the hydrometallurgical treatment. Results obtained by SimaPro software and CML-IA method show that the nitric acid leaching contributes mostly to the impacts of the hydrometallurgical process (from 40 % to 80 %), followed by the adsorption steps. From an environmental perspective, the latter can still be improved at the design phase by increasing the lifetime of the sorbents...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} study describing and quantifying material flows of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) in the Czech Republic; specifically the material flow of small waste electric and electronic equipment (s-WEEE) as well as representative substances. The studied material flows were estimated regarding aspects of the environmental impact. The End-of-Life mobile phone {{is seen as a}} typical representative of s-WEEE; therefore material flows of mobile phones are described in this thesis as well. To put it in concrete figures, approximately 124 thousand tons of WEEE from households originated in the Czech Republic in 2010, where each inhabitant got rid off 4 pieces of WEEE in average. Further, total production calculating also consumer-like WEEE from companies and institutions was around 141 thousand tons in 2010. S-WEEE present around 15 % from the <b>total</b> amount of <b>WEEE</b> originating in 2010; however it is more than 80 % as regards the number of pieces. Despite of that fact the recycling potential of Au for instance is slightly higher by s-WEEE than by large WEEE (63 kg/year compared to the 59 kg/year respectively). As regards estimation of the total production of EoL mobile phones, around 45 thousand pieces originated in the Czech Republic between the years 1990 - 2000 and 6, 5 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|For {{almost two}} decades waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment, WEEE or e-waste, has been considered a growing problem that has global consequences. The value of recovered materials, primarily in precious and base metals, has prompted {{some parts of the}} world to informally and inappropriately process e-waste causing serious environmental and human health issues. Efforts in tackling this issue have been limited and in many ways unsuccessful. The global rates for formal e-waste treatment are estimated to be below the 20 % mark, with the majority of end-of-life (EoL) electronic devices still ending up in the landfills or processed through rudimentary means. Industrial confidentiality regarding device composition combined with insufficient reporting requirements has made the task of simply characterizing the problem difficult at a global scale. To address some of these key issues, this paper presents a critical overview of existing statistics and estimations for e-waste in an Australia context, including potential value and environmental risks associated with metals recovery. From our findings, in 2014, on average per person, Australians purchased 35 kg of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) while disposed of 25 kg of WEEE, and possessed approximately 320 kg of EEE. The <b>total</b> amount of <b>WEEE</b> was estimated at 587 kt worth about US$ 370 million if all major metals are fully recovered. These results are presented over the period 2010 – 2014, detailed for major EEE product categories and metals, and followed by 2015 – 2024 forecast. Our future projection, with the base scenario fixing EEE sales at 35 kg per capita, predicts stabilization of e-waste generation in Australia at 28 – 29 kg per capita, with the total amount continuing to grow along with the population growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{take back}} and {{recycling}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) is of major importance for electronics producers due to mandatory take back regulations, {{as well as}} a commitment to producer responsibility and resource conservation. WEEE collection programs require metrics to measure performance and progress over time. Current metrics are not providing an impetus for the improvement of program quality and environmental effectiveness. This research proposes an alternative metric to measure the success of producers' collection and recycling programs, by focusing attention on raw materials recovery and the environmental benefits of recycling. Previous research is analyzed and used as a baseline {{for the development of the}} 'Avoided Environmental Burden' (AEB) metric. Sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate possibilities for corporate performance improvement. The AEB metric captures different environmental dimensions, namely energy, exergy, greenhouse gas emissions, ecological footprint, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity potential. To test the robustness of the approach, the metric is validated against the results of an empirical WEEE sampling and pre-processing trial. In this trial, the yields of six materials are assessed and inefficiencies in material separation and recovery are identified. The AEB performance of the trial is compared with the results of two modeled recycling scenarios. The results of the analysis show that collection and recycling program performance can be improved by at least 40 % if raw materials are recovered at a higher rate in pre-processing. As for the modeled cases, the research demonstrates that the collection of environmentally impactful material is useful to maximize program performance, but the potential is only fully tapped if producers select the most efficient recycling process for the treatment of the <b>collected</b> <b>WEEE.</b> The results of the analysis demonstrate that the AEB metric is a powerful tool for companies to estimate the environmental performance of collection programs at the planning stage, which in turn enables strategic program development. The AEB metric is more effective than mass and unit based metrics as it motivates producers to actively engage with the downstream recycling chain and make informed decisions based on eco-efficiency considerations...|$|R
