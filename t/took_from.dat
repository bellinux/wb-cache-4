5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|During their conquests, the Crusaders {{established}} the Latin Rite crusader {{states of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem, the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the County of Edessa. This was contrary to {{the wishes of the}} Eastern Rite Byzantines, who wanted the land that the Muslims <b>took</b> <b>from</b> them returned, rather than occupied by Latin Catholics. After the retaking of Jerusalem, most of the crusaders returned home. This left the crusader kingdoms vulnerable from Muslim reconquests during the Second and Third Crusades.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man <b>took</b> <b>from</b> a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E

5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, {{and how much}} from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he <b>took</b> <b>from</b> a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E

5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he <b>took</b> <b>from</b> Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she <b>took</b> <b>from</b> their country ten years prior.|$|E

Meanwhile, Syrena, {{reciprocating}} Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they <b>took</b> <b>from</b> him before sending {{him to get the}} chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.|$|E

As he is leaving, he meets with The Smoking Man who tells him that he can cure Scully's cancer by using a chip included in the vial Mulder <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the Pentagon. Meanwhile, Kritschgau goes before the FBI panel, denying any knowledge of Ostelhoff's murderer, also revealing that his son died that morning. Kritschgau claims to work for not only the Department of Defense but also a congressional lobbying firm known as Roush. Mulder sees Scully and her doctor about the chip. Scully's family is skeptical, particularly her brother Bill, who is quite upset with Mulder. Scully decides to go ahead and have the chip inserted in her neck.|$|E
5|$|Retubing of the ship's {{starboard}} condenser <b>took</b> <b>from</b> late December to 4 January 1915.

On {{the evening}} of 23 January, {{the bulk of the}} Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty's battlecruisers, but the fleet was too far away participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20–21 April.|$|E
5|$|SH74, {{now known}} as Bear Creek Road, curves east- and northward as it winds out of town. Narrowing to two lanes, the route follows the path of Bear Creek, curving northeasterly toward Kittredge with Pence Park on the east side. In Kittredge, the route meets CR 120 (Myers Gulch Road), which heads {{southeast}} toward Indian Hills. The route again meets Kerr Gulch Road, which bypasses the large curve which SH74 <b>took.</b> <b>From</b> Kittredge, SH74 winds eastward {{on the north side}} of Bear Creek. The roadway passes Idledale north of the Lair O the Bear Park, where it intersects Grapevine Road. East of the town, an abandoned section of SH74 exists, which now serves as a path to private areas. The route heads into Bear Creek Canyon Park, where it curves along the creek in a more rocky terrain. SH74 also passes through Red Rocks Park along the stream. Exiting the park, SH74 enters Morrison, where Bear Creek Road meets SH8 at an intersection. From here, SH8 (Morrison Road) serves as the continuation of the road toward Denver.|$|E

At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family.

5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan <b>took</b> <b>from</b> a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected {{at the entrance of}} the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front lawn of the palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace. Other notable rooms of the palace include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E
5|$|With Blood Money, Jones was {{determined}} to utilise the full colour range of the Amiga, opting to use the blitter {{as opposed to the}} hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on Menace, produced the graphics for Blood Money, while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his own game, Talisman, Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into Blood Money. The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, Walker (1993). The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones <b>took</b> <b>from</b> a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on.|$|E
