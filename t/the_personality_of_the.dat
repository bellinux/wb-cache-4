Without House's support meanwhile, Uncle and Auntie die, and Idris's body only has a short time before it too will fail. Idris reveals that House had stranded many TARDISes before, and that its universe is hours away from collapsing. The Doctor and Idris work together to construct a makeshift TARDIS from scraps, and then pursue House.|$|E

5|$|The family records, many {{of which}} were {{translated}} and published in the , reveal <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man who figures prominently in the history of colonization as the founder of the only successful patroonship that ever existed in New Netherland. But beyond the fact that he managed this patroonship and that he was a merchant and director of the West India Company, practically nothing was known until the organization and translation of the family records in the early 1900s (decade).|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{specifically}} military grievances {{that led}} to the mutiny of the 5th Light Infantry centred on <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Martin. He had been promoted from major in the regiment, bur the previous colonel had reported that he was unpopular with his fellow officers and that he inspired little respect among the men. His appointment led to disunity amongst the British officers, which was reflected by division among the Indian officers over the promotion to commissioned rank of a colour-havildar. The issues, which might, under ordinary circumstances, have been of limited impact, were aggregated by the disruptive external influences of the Ghadar Party propaganda noted above and the entry of Turkey into the war.|$|E

5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
25|$|The script {{significantly}} altered <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title character, {{played the}} story straight instead of as a satire, removed the surrealist elements, and added supernatural elements that could highlight special effects {{work done by}} Lucas' ILM.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} this {{movement}} is reflected in Graetz's History of the Jews. Graetz attempts to deduce <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pharisees based on the laws or aggadot that they cite, and show that their personalities influenced the laws they expounded.|$|E

25|$|Self-Portrait with Palette (French: Autoportrait à la palette) is an 1878–79 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by the French artist Édouard Manet. This late impressionistic work {{is one of}} his two self-portraits. Velasquez's self-portrait in Las Meninas was a particular inspiration for Manet's painting which despite its allusion to the previous artist's work is very modern in its focus upon <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist and loose paint handling.|$|E
25|$|Huyck and Katz {{began to}} develop ideas for the film. Early on in the production, {{it was decided that}} <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{character}} would be changed from that of the comics, in which Howard was rude and obnoxious, to make the character nicer. Gerber read over the script and offered his comments and suggestions. In addition, Hyuck and Katz met with Gerber to discuss a horror sequence with which they were having difficulty.|$|E

In 2004, Anderson starred in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Rebecca Gilman's play The Sweetest Swing in Baseball, as artist Dana Fielding who assumes <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troubled baseball player Darryl Strawberry – a role for which she earned rave reviews.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{horoscope}} {{has been}} constructed {{the process of}} interpretation can begin, which involves building a complete picture of <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject, or native. Interpretation involves three main steps: noting the important features of the chart, and the processes of chart weighting and chart shaping. Chart weighting involves noting the distribution of zodiac signs and houses in the chart, and {{the significance of this}} to the overall personality of the native. Chart shaping involves assessing the placement of the planets by aspect and position in the chart, and noting any significant patterns which occur between them.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated {{with what}} Bahlman called the “timid sort of nature” of GLAAD’s and CLGR’s tactics {{in the face}} of the AIDS crisis, Robinson and Noro {{determined}} that they needed to start a new group. In the late summer of 1986, in the wake of the Supreme Court of the United States’ ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, they began meeting with a small group of friends at Bahlman’s apartment. In addition to Robinson, Noro, and Bahlman, early participants included Henry Yaeger Jean Elizabeth Glass Eric Perez, and Petrelis. The group would come to call itself the Lavender Hill Mob, after a well-known comic British film — a title they believed captured <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and its actions: gay, confrontational, creative, and humorous.|$|E
25|$|Domestic servants, {{two-thirds of}} whom were women, made up about fifteen to {{twenty percent of the}} {{population}} of the capital. Before the Revolution they had worked largely for the nobility, whose families sometimes had as many as thirty servants. During the Empire they were employed more commonly by the new nobility, the newly wealthy and middle class. Upper-middle-class families often had three servants; families of artisans and shopkeepers usually had one. Living conditions of servants depended largely upon <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master, but were never easy. Napoleon abolished the death penalty which previously could be given to a servant who stole from his master, but any servant who was even suspected of stealing would never be able to get another job. Any servant who became pregnant, married or not, could be dismissed immediately.|$|E
