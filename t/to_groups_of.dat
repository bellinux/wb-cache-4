5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall <b>to</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E

5|$|Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), a California-based former salesman, {{training}} manager and {{executive in the}} encyclopedia business, created the Erhard Seminars Training (est) course in 1971. est {{was a form of}} Large Group Awareness Training, and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given <b>to</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> 250people at a time. The program was very intensive: each day would contain 15–20hours of instruction. During the training, est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts, and participants had to agree to certain rules that remained in effect {{for the duration of the}} course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes, and were promised a dramatic change in their self-perception. est was controversial. While some critics characterized the training methods as brainwashing, proponents and participants asserted that it had a profoundly positive impact on people's lives. By 1984 nearly half a million people had completed the est training, including public figures and mental health professionals.|$|E

5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items <b>to</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary to subsidize basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E
