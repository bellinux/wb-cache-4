5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E

5|$|A 1943 {{attempt by}} Somervell <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Technical Services failed amid the furor and panic created by false rumors {{that he was}} being {{considered}} for the post of chief of staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force.

5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E

Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization {{and that it was}} necessary to work towards it.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. This {{would be the}} last attempt <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> council and, as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941.

5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly.

Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E

However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> Electoral College by {{constitutional amendment}} {{have been introduced}} in Congress over the decades.

5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as {{attorney}} general. The Relief faction {{in the legislature}} passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation <b>to</b> <b>abolish</b> <b>the</b> entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
