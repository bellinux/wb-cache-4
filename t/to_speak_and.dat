His passion for reading allowed him to assimilate any information. Pedro II, was not a genius, although he was intelligent and possessed a facility for accumulating knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E

5|$|A {{modicum of}} {{stability}} during his childhood {{was provided by}} his aia (governess), Maria Genoveva do Rêgo e Matos, whom he loved as a mother, and by his aio (supervisor) friar António de Arrábida, who became his mentor. Both {{were in charge of}} Pedro's upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. He learned <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size.

The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> <b>and</b> when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|During King Kalākaua's {{world tour}} in 1881, Liliʻuokalani served as Regent in his absence. It {{was during this}} regency that Liliʻuokalani visited the leper {{settlement}} at Kalaupapa on Molokaʻi in September. She was too overcome <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> John Makini Kapena, one of her brother's minister, had to address the people on her behalf. After the visit, {{in the name of}} her brother, Liliʻuokalani made Father Damien a knight commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for his service to her subjects. She also convinced the governmental board of health to set aside land for a leprosy hospital at Kakaʻako. She made a second visit to the settlement with Queen Kapiolani in 1884.|$|E
5|$|George's mother, the Electress Sophia, died on 28 May 1714 {{at the age}} of 83. She had {{collapsed}} in the gardens at Herrenhausen after rushing to shelter from a shower of rain. George was now Queen Anne's direct heir. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> <b>and</b> died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. George was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.|$|E

5|$|On July 22, 1916, Riley {{suffered}} a second stroke. He recovered enough {{during the day}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> joke with his companions. He died before dawn the next morning, July 23. Riley's death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers. President Woodrow Wilson wrote a brief note to Riley's family offering condolences {{on behalf of the}} entire nation. Indiana Governor Samuel M. Ralston offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the Indiana Statehouse—Abraham Lincoln being the only other person to have previously received such an honor. During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles long {{at the end of the}} day and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to Crown Hill Cemetery where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover they are unable <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role {{as an agent of}} The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{operation}} is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able <b>to</b> <b>speak)</b> <b>and</b> the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter comes {{up with an idea}} to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. While the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.|$|E
5|$|Ray Davies {{released}} the solo album Storyteller, a companion piece to X-Ray, in 1998. Originally written {{two years earlier}} as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network VH1 launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled VH1 Storytellers. Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again. However, hopes for a reunion were dashed when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> play guitar. Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with {{all four of the}} original band members in attendance. The award was presented by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime Kinks fan and friend of Ray Davies. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.|$|E
