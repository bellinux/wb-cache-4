5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors {{who gave the}} credit to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> Terminus {{had been introduced}} to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival of an early animistic reverence for the power inherent in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property.|$|E

5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule {{does not necessarily mean that}} there was an overt struggle between <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Saxon gods and <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. <b>The</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus.

5|$|Jainism {{became popular}} in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I {{constructed}} numerous Jain basadis. King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which {{is evident from the}} construction of the Gommateshwara monolith. Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars (Jinas) whose images were consecrated in their temples. <b>The</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of Tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). <b>The</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> subordinate deities such as yaksa and yaksi, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream Indian {{cultural}} elements {{coexist with}} traditional {{practices of the}} ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> regional deities.

5|$|Most {{accepted}} Lord Shiva as {{the primary}} deity and the lingam, the universal symbol of Shiva, was consecrated in shrines dedicated to him.

5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages.

But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E
