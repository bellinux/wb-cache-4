5|$|North of the station, <b>tracks</b> 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), <b>tracks</b> 5 through 2 merge into another track, and <b>tracks</b> 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four <b>tracks</b> have switches that connect the <b>tracks</b> to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. <b>Tracks</b> from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the station, <b>tracks</b> 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other <b>tracks</b> (with a pair of switches between <b>tracks</b> 5 and 6) and <b>tracks</b> 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. <b>Tracks</b> 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line <b>tracks)</b> are above <b>tracks</b> 5 and 6 (the Culver Line <b>tracks)</b> at this point.|$|E
5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of <b>tracks</b> {{and a pair of}} double {{switches}} between these <b>tracks,</b> and each service has its own island platform serving these <b>tracks.</b> In regular operation, no service needs to cross over the <b>tracks</b> of another service. The <b>tracks</b> are numbered sequentially from east to west, with the N train at <b>tracks</b> 1 and 2; the Q at <b>tracks</b> 3 and 4; the F at <b>tracks</b> 5 and 6; and the D at <b>tracks</b> 7 and 8.|$|E

5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs.
