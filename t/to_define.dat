5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common <b>to</b> <b>define</b> a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common <b>to</b> <b>define</b> a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one <b>to</b> <b>define</b> length and the other <b>to</b> <b>define</b> mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|Feminism is a {{range of}} {{political}} movements, ideologies, and social movements that share a common goal: <b>to</b> <b>define,</b> establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes.

5|$|How species {{should be}} defined in a {{particular}} group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that {{are referred to as}} the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how <b>to</b> <b>define</b> species has been called microtaxonomy.

5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted <b>to</b> <b>define</b> forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors <b>to</b> <b>define</b> new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek <b>to</b> <b>define</b> the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek <b>to</b> <b>define</b> the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
