The site is a collection of pages which describe CTA, reports on its activities, lists a calendar of events, carries the catalogue of publications, and several full texts of publications, and, of course, every issue of Spore since the end of 1977. The statistics for a two-month period from mid-November 2000 onwards show that Spore gets hit the most, accounting for one-third of all visits. This is partly because the various questions which bring people to the site are mentioned most often in Spore. Having read Spore in part or in full (more than 300 complete sets were copied to other people s computers), it seems that many people visit other parts of the site. Who is hitting us? That s hard to tell; we can only see the location of the server computer which is linking the enquirer s computer to ours. We cannot see where the enquirer is. So when we say 63 % of hits are from North America and 32 % from Europe, 2. 5 % from Africa and 0. 5 % from Oceania, we are, for once, far from the truth.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} social marketing and branding theories. The aim of the {{research is}} to find out which has been the reception of The Body Shop brand in Estonia. Body Shop is the object of this research and is handled as a spirited brand. The notion “spirited brand” cues to a research of Marjorie Thompson and Hamish Pringle and their book Brand Spirit. How Cause Related Marketing Builds Brands (2003). Author of this work set up three main research-questions and during the research found out the answers. Qualitative methods were used to reach the goals of this work. Author carried out three interviews with experts and seven with consumers. Furthermore, the qualitative inner-analyses of media texts and Internet forums were carried out to reach the best results. Research questions and goals were the basis to carry out interviews. To conclude the main results originating from the research-questions one may say that Body Shop as a brand with spirit and several social values has been accepted positively in Estonia. But not only because of its social values, but mainly because of the brand itself, the atmosphere of shops and the smell of products. Social dimension comes about thirdly when one must say the queue of the reason to consume The Body Shop. Remarkable is that Body Shop values are known quite well among the consumers, although the company does not provide any commercial. And in Estonia commercial-culture is quite broad, people have used <b>to</b> see and <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of commercial. And although social marketing in Estonia is quite new topic the research found out that the more campaigns there is and the more media and experts introduce social marketing related to business, the more people are interested of it and the more they care about community and social values provided. It is the question of public opinion and public attention. The motives of The Body Shop consuming are more related to status and trends than social values. It was said that although people would want to buy the products that support some social problems, Body Shop products are expensive enough to prefer some other companies, although they may do animal testing or not to be as planet- protecting as Body Shop. At the same time when some people say the products are too expensive, there is a group of loyal customers who say the knew Body Shop long before it came to Estonia. These people say they admire Body Shop as a cosmetic-brand as well as social-values pioneer in business. To conclude the main results originating from the research-questions one may say that Body Shop as a brand with spirit and several social values has been accepted positively in Estonia. But not only because of its social values, but mainly because of the brand itself, the atmosphere of shops and the smell of products.

The Body Shop entering in Estonian market was bringing a new view of environment- protecting cosmetics. Reception of Body Shop has been positive and supportive, and the consumers find that Body Shop deals with good things and provides nice shop environment. The negative aspect is the price of products, although comparing the prices abroad among all the other cosmetic products, TBS is not more expensive than widespread cosmetics, for example L’Oreal (Body Shop belongs now to L’Oreal) ...|$|R
