5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E
5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{antimicrobial}} properties of five endodontic sealers: Endo Fill, Endomethasone, Endomethasone N, Sealer 26 and AH-Plus, against the following microorganisms: Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces naeslundii. <b>The</b> <b>sealers</b> were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation. The direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of <b>the</b> <b>sealers.</b> <b>The</b> results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, Endo-Fill and Endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. <b>Sealer</b> 26 demonstrated <b>the</b> lowest antimicrobial activity. At all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> tested. In conclusion, none of <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> totally inhibited <b>the</b> growth of the microorganisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon the microbial susceptibility to them...|$|R
5000|$|In 1827 a {{group of}} sealers took 5 Aborigines to Green Island to catch birds. <b>The</b> <b>sealers</b> rowed away, leaving the Aborigines behind, then {{returned}} the next day bringing water. The Aborigines attempted to take the boat, and <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> fired on them killing one Aboriginal man. The remaining Aborigines were removed to Michaelmas Island and left there making [...] "great lamentations".|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the women}} were taken back to the islands by <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> involuntarily and some went willingly, {{as in the case of}} a woman called Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer). Differing {{opinions}} have been given on Walyer's involvement with <b>the</b> <b>sealers.</b> McFarlane writes that she voluntarily joined <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> with members of her family, and was responsible for attacking Aboriginal people and white settlers alike.However, Ryan comes to a different conclusion, that Walyer had been abducted at Port Sorell by Aboriginal people and traded to <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> for dogs and flour. Walyer was later to gain some notoriety for her attempts to kill <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> to escape their brutality. Walyer, a Punnilerpanner, joined the Plairhekehillerplue band after eventually escaping and went on to lead attacks on employees of the Van Diemen's Land Company. Walyer's attacks are the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people. Captured, she refused to work and was banished to Penguin Island. Later imprisoned on Swan Island she attempted to organise a rebellion. Although Aboriginal women were by custom forbidden to take part in war, several Aboriginal women who escaped from sealers became leaders or took part in attacks. According to Lyndall Ryan, the women traded to, or kidnapped by sealers became [...] "a significant dissident group" [...] against white authority.|$|R

25|$|Once {{the basic}} {{geography}} of Franz Josef Land became apparent, expeditions shifted {{to using the}} archipelago {{as a base for}} attempts to reach the North Pole. The first of these was conducted by the National Geographic Society-sponsored American journalist Walter Wellman. With experience of an expedition to Svalbard in 1894, he led an expedition of four Americans and five Norwegians on <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Frithjof, which departed Tromsø in late June 1898. They arrived off Franz Josef Land on 27July, then visited Eira Lodge and Cape Flora. At Elmwood, Wellman gathered most of the supplies and continued eastwards, circumnavigating Wilczek Island and Salm Island before establishing a base at Cape Tegetthof at the south of Hall Island. On 30July he rendezvoused with the steamship Hekla, which had caught 212 walrus and 70 bears. From 3August a party traveled northwards via Hall Island to Cape Hansa on southern Wilczek Land under poor conditions.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the apical seal obtained with two sealers: Sealapex (Kerr-Sybron, Orange, USA) a calcium hydroxide-based sealer and Endofill (Dentsply, Petrópolis, Brazil) a zinc oxide eugenol-based sealer. Method: Twenty four extracted single-rooted human teeth {{were divided into}} two groups, with ten each, instrumented and filled by lateral condensation technique with gutta-percha and one of <b>the</b> <b>sealers.</b> Four teeth were used as positive and negative control. After filling, all specimens were coated with nail vernish except around the apical foramen (the negative control group was completely covered), and then immersed in indian ink for 96 hours, decalcified, dehydrated and diaphanized. Results: The extent of staining was examined under a stereo microscope and the data were statistically analyzed by the Tukey test. Numerically Sealapex (Kerr-Sybron, Orange, USA) experimental group had lower levels of marginal leakage than Endofill (Dentsply, Petrópolis, Brasil). The negative control exhibited no leakage and in the positive control leakage was complete. There was no statistically significant differencebetween <b>the</b> <b>sealers.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>sealers</b> showed similar apical sealing ability. Neither of <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> in this study completely prevented leakage...|$|R

50|$|Kokkas et al. (2004) {{examined}} {{the effect of}} the smear layer on the penetration depth of three different sealers (AH Plus, Apexit, and a Grossman type-Roth 811) into the dentinal tubules. Sixty four extracted human single-rooted teeth were used and divided into two groups. The smear layer remained intact in all the roots of group A. Complete removal of the smear layer in group B was achieved after irrigation with 3 ml of 17% EDTA for 3 min, followed by 3 ml of 1% NaOCl solution. Ten roots from each group were obturated with AH Plus and laterally condensed gutta-percha points. The same process was repeated for the remaining roots by using sealers Apexit and Roth 811 correspondingly. After complete setting, the maximum penetration depth of <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> into <b>the</b> dentinal tubules was examined in upper, middle, and lower levels. The smear layer prevented all <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> from penetrating dentinal tubules. In contrast, in smear layer-free root canals, all <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> penetrated dentinal tubules, although the depth of penetration varied between <b>the</b> <b>sealers.</b> Furthermore smear layer adversely affected the coronal and apical sealing ability of sealers.|$|R
500|$|On 3 June 1888, Nansen's {{party was}} picked up from the {{north-western}} Icelandic port of Ísafjörður by <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Jason. A week later the Greenland coast was sighted, but progress was hindered by thick pack ice. On 17 July, with the coast still [...] away, Nansen decided to launch the small boats; they were {{within sight of the}} Sermilik Fjord, which Nansen believed would offer a route up on to the icecap.|$|E
500|$|Morrell {{was born}} at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was {{employed}} as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea {{at the age of}} 17 [...] "without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul". During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison, England, for two years. After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer, [...] and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1882 Nansen took [...] "...the first fatal {{step that}} led me astray from the quiet life of science." [...] Professor Robert Collett of the university's zoology {{department}} proposed that Nansen take a sea voyage, to study Arctic zoology at first hand. Nansen was enthusiastic, and made arrangements through a recent acquaintance, Captain Axel Krefting, commander of <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Viking. The voyage began on 11 March 1882 and extended {{over the following}} five months. [...] In the weeks before sealing started, Nansen was able to concentrate on scientific studies. From water samples he showed that, contrary to previous assumption, sea ice forms {{on the surface of}} the water rather than below. His readings also demonstrated that the Gulf Stream flows beneath a cold layer of surface water. [...] Through the spring and early summer Viking roamed between Greenland and Spitsbergen in search of seal herds. Nansen became an expert marksman, and on one day proudly recorded that his team had shot 200 seal. In July, Viking became trapped in the ice close to an unexplored section of the Greenland coast; Nansen longed to go ashore, but this was impossible. However, he began to develop the idea that the Greenland icecap might be explored, or even crossed. On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and early in August was back in Norwegian waters.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Sea Shepherd {{interfered}} with the hunting of grey seals in Ireland. They prevented boats from landing and took clubs and rifles away from <b>the</b> <b>sealers.</b> <b>The</b> media attention garnered from the campaign led to Ireland banning sealing in October of that year.|$|R
50|$|More {{extensive}} {{contact between}} Aboriginal Tasmanians and Europeans resulted when British and American seal hunters began visiting the islands in Bass Strait {{as well as}} the northern and eastern coasts of Tasmania from the late 1790s. Shortly thereafter (by about 1800), sealers were regularly left on uninhabited islands in Bass Strait during the sealing season (November to May). <b>The</b> <b>sealers</b> established semi-permanent camps or settlements on the islands, which were close enough for <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> to reach <b>the</b> main island of Tasmania in small boats and so make contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.|$|R

500|$|In {{the dark}} winter months of May, June and July, Shackleton was {{concerned}} to maintain fitness, training and morale. Although the scope for activity was limited, {{the dogs were}} exercised (and on occasion raced competitively), men were encouraged to take moonlight walks, and aboard ship there were attempted theatricals. Special occasions such as Empire Day (24 May) were duly celebrated. The first signs of the ice breaking up occurred on 22 July. On 1 August, in a south-westerly gale with heavy snow, the ice floe began to disintegrate all around the ship, the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the keel and causing a heavy list to port. The position was perilous; Shackleton wrote: [...] "The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice [...] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed". This danger passed, and the succeeding weeks were quiet. During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where, in 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell of <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Wasp reported seeing a coastline which he identified as [...] "New South Greenland". There {{was no sign of}} any such land; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} the crew {{were out on the}} {{surrounding}} ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, and all of the Inuit, found themselves stranded on an ice floe. The castaways could see the Polaris [...] away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile. Resigned to the ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had [...] of food. They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice. Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the Davis Strait and would soon be within rowing distance of Disko. He was incorrect; the men were actually on the Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land very unlikely. One night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores. The group drifted on the ice floe {{for the next six months}} over [...] before being rescued off the coast of Newfoundland by <b>the</b> <b>sealer</b> Tigress on April 30, 1873. All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ebierbing and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions. Despite this, scarcely a word was written about the Inuit in either the official reports of the expedition, or the press.|$|E

Forty single-rooted teeth were selected. After chemical-mechanical preparation and root-canal filling, sections of the root (2, 4 and 6 mm from the apex) were obtained and analyzed by stereo microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed. With regard to the assessment of void spaces in the filling material at 2 mm from <b>the</b> apex, <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> showed similar results, but at 4 and 6 mm from the apex, MTA Fillapex had inferior performance compared to AH Plus (at 4 mm), Pulp Canal Sealer EWT (at 4 and 6 mm) and Sealapex (at 6 mm) (p< 0. 05).

2500|$|The first castaways {{to use of}} one {{of these}} depots were members of the crew of the Derry Castle, an iron barque, which was wrecked on Enderby Island on 20 March 1887. Eight of the 23 crew made it ashore. A depot was in place (at Sandy Bay), but looters had removed all {{supplies}} but a bottle of salt, so the castaways subsisted on shellfish and a small quantity of wheat recovered from the wreck. [...] After 92 days they discovered an axe head in the sand and were able to use it to build a boat from the wreckage. Two of the men navigated the boat to nearby Erebus Cove, Port Ross, on Auckland Island, where they obtained supplies from the government depot that had been established there.

5000|$|There are {{numerous}} {{stories of the}} sealers' brutality towards the Aboriginal women; {{with some of these}} reports originating from Robinson. In 1830, Robinson seized 14 Aboriginal women from <b>the</b> <b>sealers,</b> planning for them to marry Aboriginal men at the Flinders Island settlement. Josephine Flood, an archaeologist specialising in Australian mainland Aboriginal peoples, notes: [...] "he encountered strong resistance from the women as well as sealers". <b>The</b> <b>sealers</b> sent a representative, James Munro, to appeal to Governor Arthur and argue for the women's return on the basis that they wanted to stay with their sealer husbands and children rather than marry Aboriginal men unknown to them. Arthur ordered the return of some of the women. Shortly thereafter, Robinson began to disseminate stories, told to him by James Munro, of atrocities allegedly committed by <b>the</b> <b>sealers</b> against Aboriginal people and against Aboriginal women, in particular. Brian Plomley, who edited Robinson's papers, expressed scepticism about these atrocities and notes that they were not reported to Archdeacon Broughton's 1830 committee of inquiry into violence towards Tasmanians. Abduction and ill-treatment of Aboriginal Tasmanians certainly occurred, but the extent is debated.|$|R
