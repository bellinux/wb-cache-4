5|$|On 1 November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired cannon bursts at a USAF MQ-1 Predator drone 16 {{nautical}} {{miles off the}} Iranian coast. The Iranian government has claimed that <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> violated its airspace.|$|E
5|$|A D-21 {{mounted on}} an M-21 began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. Aerodynamic covers were {{initially}} {{placed over the}} D-21's intake and exhaust to reduce drag, but {{had to be removed}} after the first few tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> or carrier plane could be devised.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the Army's evaluation, Radioplane, as a private venture, conducted an improvement program for the RP-77D, fitting the aircraft with a larger wing, along with other modifications that improved the performance of <b>the</b> <b>drone.</b> However these improvements were insufficient to produce a renewed interest from the Army.|$|E

50|$|While {{perfect for}} reconnaissance, {{the use of}} a mere radar van for command, track and control limit the combat ability of <b>the</b> <b>drones.</b> <b>The</b> team {{controlling}} <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> was limited to a single, stationary recovery area. In order to improve the range and recoverability of <b>the</b> <b>drones,</b> some C-130As were modified to carry <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> on pylons under the wings and were re-designated as GC-130, MC-130 or DC-130.|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. <b>The</b> <b>drone</b> was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with air sampling equipment. The RP-77D utilised the RPTA tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control. Tip tanks allowed for carriage of additional fuel to extend the aircraft's range, and recovery {{at the end of the}} flight was by parachute.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). <b>The</b> <b>drone</b> was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>drones</b> {{consist of}} {{two pieces of}} wood (three for <b>the</b> larger <b>drone)</b> that {{telescope}} into one another to tune <b>the</b> instrument. <b>The</b> <b>drones</b> have single reeds. The chanter {{is equipped with a}} double reed of reed or plastic.|$|R
50|$|Gareth Liddiard is an Australian {{musician}} and {{founding member of}} <b>The</b> <b>Drones.</b> Liddiard has released one album as a solo artist and seven studio albums with <b>the</b> <b>Drones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Liddiard formed <b>The</b> <b>Drones</b> with Pereira in 1997 {{and then}} {{relocated}} {{with the band}} to Victoria in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>Drones</b> have released six studio albums since 2002 and have toured throughout the world, including music festivals.|$|R
5|$|Maurice Hurley saw {{the episode}} as {{commentary}} {{on the sale of}} F-14 Tomcats to Iran. He intended to have Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) reveal her feelings for Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in this episode, but Gene Roddenberry had it changed. Dan Curry created the model of <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> seen in this episode using a pantyhose container and a shampoo bottle. The opinions of critics were mixed, but singled out the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli for praise.|$|E
5|$|President Obama {{continued}} <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> strikes that President George W. Bush started {{during his}} presidency in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. Obama also ordered drone strikes in Libya in 2011, the Philippines in 2012, and Syria in 2014. Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in Yemen, and 2 US troops in Libya {{at the end}} of his presidency.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{were unaware}} of this and mounted further attacks on the site {{as part of the}} United States Army Air Forces {{experimental}} Operation Aphrodite, involving radio-controlled B-24 Liberators packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.– the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy– was killed when <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end of the bombing campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs had been dropped on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.|$|E

5|$|The D-21 was {{designed}} to carry a single high-resolution photographic camera over a preprogrammed path, then release the camera module into the air for retrieval, after which <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> would self-destruct. Following a fatal accident when launched from an M-21, the D-21 was modified to be launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. Several test flights were made, followed by four unsuccessful operational D-21 flights over the People's Republic of China, and the program was canceled in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with {{maximum speed}} {{in excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched {{from the back of}} a M-21 carrier aircraft, a variant of the Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>drone</b> attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E

5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 {{that had}} {{disappeared}} on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent. <b>The</b> <b>drone</b> had self-destructed over Siberia and the Soviets had recovered the wreckage. The Tupolev design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy, named the Voron (Raven), but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three {{previous}} launches this one was performed straight and level, not in an outside loop {{to assist in the}} separation of <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail after separation, leading to the destruction of both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torick, drowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> {{was created by}} Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose {{container}} and a shampoo bottle. He hand animated the model instead of using motion control photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid. In order to blend into the background, he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen.|$|E
25|$|Mating {{occurs in}} flight, which {{accounts}} for the need of <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> for better vision, which is provided by their large eyes. Should a drone succeed in mating, he soon dies because the penis and associated abdominal tissues are ripped from <b>the</b> <b>drone's</b> body after sexual intercourse.|$|R
50|$|They {{have also}} collaborated {{individually}} with Rhizomatics director Daito Manabe {{to create a}} technology-enhanced show called Drone-Augmented Amazingness, which uses three drones {{as well as a}} projection-mapped backdrop. At first, the dancers direct <b>the</b> <b>drones,</b> but by <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> piece, <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> replace <b>the</b> dancers.|$|R
50|$|SCeris, Hunter, Garren and Merik arrive, {{holding off}} <b>the</b> <b>drones.</b> As Prentice prepares to {{obliterate}} the target area, and every living thing in it, a quick-thinking SCeris uses his combadge {{to provide a}} precise target lock for Intrepids phasers. The generator is destroyed, shutting off the field, and disabling <b>the</b> <b>drones.</b> <b>The</b> Surai vessels retreat, and Prentice opts not to pursue them.|$|R
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. The interplay between these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, two of the crew are trapped on the Romulan drone ship while Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) on the Enterprise attempts to gain the co-operation of the Andorians and Tellarites in tracking down <b>the</b> <b>drone.</b> His plan is complicated when Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) challenges a Tellarite to a duel, causing Archer to step in. After he defeats Shran, the races work together and force the retreat of the Romulan vessel and the missing crewman are recovered.|$|E
