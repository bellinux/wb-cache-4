5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The medical {{expertise}} to treat to complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth has not spared {{girls and women}} in developing countries from dying of such conditions. Developing countries account {{for the bulk of}} the global share of maternal deaths with complications of pregnancy and childbirth being {{the leading cause of death}} in young women aged between 15 and 49. Sub-Saharan Africa is responsible for nearly three-fifths of all global maternal deaths which have saddled it with notoriously high levels of maternal mortality ratios, a concern that has been red-flagged internationally and regionally. Most studies on maternal mortality in Africa have been confined to an examination of factors impinging on maternal mortality from both medical and socioeconomic standpoints for individual country’s based on survey data. Our study differs from others as it employs logistic regression to look at the association between non-medical factors and maternal mortality nationally for all African countries. Whilst the results from the logistic regression suggests that there is no statistically significant relationship between any of the variables and maternal mortality, the odds ratio for Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross National Income per capita (GNI) imply that African countries with low HDI are about <b>three</b> <b>time</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have high maternal mortality compared to high HDI countries. Similarly, African countries with low GNI are about five <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have high maternal mortality compared to high GNI countries...|$|R

Other psychosocial risk factors associated with woman experiencing PGP include higher level of stress, low job satisfaction and poorer relationship with spouse.|$|E
25|$|Earlier sexual activity, {{increased}} {{changing of}} sexual partners, {{higher rate of}} unwanted (teenage) pregnancy, higher rate of sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and alcohol-related damage to the fetus during pregnancy is associated with binge drinking. Female binge drinkers are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be victims of sexual assault; 50 percent of adolescent girls reporting sexual assault were {{under the influence of}} alcohol or another psychotropic substance at the time.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{fraternity}} men are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to commit rape than other men on college campuses. Fraternities {{have often been}} accused of fostering rape-supportive attitudes by promoting male dominance and brotherhood, and fraternity affiliation {{has been found to}} be a significant predictor of sexually predatory behavior in retrospective research. Furthermore, studies show that women in sororities are almost twice as likely to experience rape than other college women.|$|E

In addition, [...] "people with Hepatitis C who develop diabetes probably have susceptible insulin-producing cells, and probably would get it anyway, but much later in life. The extra insulin resistance caused by Hepatitis C apparently brings on diabetes at age 35 or 40, instead of 65 or 70." ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} past, much sports {{medicine}} research {{has centered on}} the disproportionate number of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female athletes. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that females are <b>three</b> to eight <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to suffer non-contact ACL injuries than their male counterparts. Although the exact reason for this discrepancy is not known, many hypotheses exist that propose intrinsic and extrinsic factors which leave females more susceptible to this injury...|$|R
50|$|BMS {{is fairly}} common worldwide, (however, other sources {{describe}} it as rare), and affects up to five individuals per 100,000 general population. People with BMS are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be middle aged or elderly, and females are <b>three</b> to seven <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have BMS than males. Some report a female to male ratio {{of as much as}} 33 to 1. BMS is reported in about 10-40% of women seeking medical treatment for menopausal symptoms, and BMS occurs in about 14% of postmenopausal women. Males and younger individuals of both sexes are sometimes affected.|$|R
25|$|Neutering {{increases}} {{life expectancy}} in cats: {{one study found}} castrated male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Non-neutered cats in the USA are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to require treatment for an animal bite. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine, cervical or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E
25|$|Substantial {{scientific}} {{evidence shows that}} higher cigarette prices result in lower overall cigarette consumption. Most studies indicate that a 10% increase in price will reduce overall cigarette consumption by 3% to 5%. Youth, minorities, and low-income smokers are two to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to quit or smoke less than other smokers in response to price increases. Smoking is often cited {{as an example of}} an inelastic good, however, i.e. a large rise in price will only result in a small decrease in consumption.|$|E
25|$|High risk {{procedures}} {{or medical}} specialties {{are responsible for}} most avoidable adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care. Even though complex procedures entail more risk, adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to {{the severity of the}} condition being treated.). However, USP has reported that medication errors {{during the course of a}} surgical procedure are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care.|$|E

Most candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools (lycée). In case of failure, it is possible to retry once. Yearly success rate depends on the university's current numerus clausus and the number or registered students, ranging from 10 to 30% bearing in mind that second-time participants are <b>three</b> to four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed than students trying for the first time.|$|R
30|$|The disease most {{commonly}} occurs in patients over 65  years of age. men are <b>three</b> to four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be affected}} than women, and lesions are bilateral in 40 – 60 % of patients. Patients present clinically with painless subcutaneous nodules [53]. These nodules may progress slowly to fibrous cords or bands that attach to and cause traction on the underlying flexor tendons, resulting in flexion contractures of the digits. The fourth and fifth digits are {{most commonly}} involved. Patients commonly have related diseases such as plantar fibromatosis (5 – 20 %), Peyronie’s disease, and keloid or knuckle pad fibromatosis.|$|R
40|$|In North America, {{substance}} misuse is {{very common}} among young people involved with the juvenile justice system, {{and even more so}} among American Indian and Canadian First Nations youth. In new research, Kelley J. Sittner examines the relationship between substance use disorder and other mental disorders such as conduct disorder and ADHD among indigenous young people. She finds that the rates of conduct disorder and substance use disorder were almost twice as large among the arrested than non-arrested adolescents, and that those young people with such disorders were <b>three</b> or four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be arrested than those without...|$|R
25|$|Peer-to-peer sexual {{harassment}} is <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than perpetration by teachers or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers {{may also be a}} result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical {{sexual harassment}}. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a direct {{correlation}} between poverty and mental illness. The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished people are actually two to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class. This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in-group demographic differences that they may possess. These families must deal with economic stressors like unemployment and lack of affordable housing, which can lead to mental health disorders. A person's socioeconomic class outlines the psychosocial, environmental, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that are associated with mental health.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} propose using brain imaging to help {{decide which}} soon-to-be-released offenders are {{at greater risk}} for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status. To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region.

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is <b>three</b> to four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of Islamic ex-gay (i.e. people {{claiming}} to have experienced a basic change in sexual orientation from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality) groups aimed at attempting to guide homosexuals towards heterosexuality. A large body of research and global scientific consensus indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful. People who have gone through conversion therapy face 8.9 times the rates of suicide ideation, face depression at 5.9 {{times the rate of}} their peers and are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to use illegal drugs compared to those who did not go through the therapy.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer health {{outcomes}} than men for several reasons ranging from sustaining greater risk to diseases to experiencing higher mortality rates. In the Population Studies Center Research Report by Rachel Snow that compares the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of both male and females, the global DALYs lost to females for sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are more than ten times greater {{than those of the}} males. Moreover, the female DALYs to male DALYs ratio for malnutrition-related diseases such as Iron-Deficiency Anemia are often close to 1.5, suggesting that poor nutrition impacts women at a much higher level than men. Additionally, in terms of mental illnesses, women are also two to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to be diagnosed with depression. With regards to suicidal rates, up to 80% of those who committed suicide or attempted suicide in Iran are women.|$|E

BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws. According {{to a study by}} Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances. Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look. The main causes of male body issues on the other hand, include 25% being teased about their weight, while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness. A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others.|$|E

The main emphasis of our paper is on possible bias in these population-based results due to refusal {{to participate in the}} HIV-test. We use the identity of interviewers to identify the participation effect and correct for unobservables.
