5|$|Most {{thunderstorms}} {{come and}} go fairly uneventfully; however, any <b>thunderstorm</b> can become severe, and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of lightning. <b>Thunderstorm</b> preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a <b>thunderstorm</b> to minimize injury and damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thunderstorm</b> asthma is the {{triggering}} of an asthma {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local <b>thunderstorm.</b> During a <b>thunderstorm,</b> pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.|$|E
5|$|Avoid {{electrical}} appliances, including corded telephones. Cordless {{and wireless}} telephones are {{safe to use}} during a <b>thunderstorm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>thunderstorms</b> can {{sometimes}} produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from <b>thunderstorms</b> {{can result in}} flash flooding. <b>Thunderstorms</b> occur most often during the summer but can occur {{at any time of}} the year.|$|R
50|$|A {{flanking}} line {{is an area}} of cumulus congestus {{or small}} cumulonimbus that mark an area of widespread updrafts in front of strong <b>thunderstorms.</b> These flanking lines generally occur in the vicinity of supercell <b>thunderstorms</b> or large multicell <b>thunderstorms.</b>|$|R
30|$|Many {{parts of}} India {{experience}} <b>thunderstorms</b> during the pre-monsoon season (April to May) and such <b>thunderstorms</b> are generally severe {{in the northeastern}} part of India. Reasons {{for the formation of}} severe <b>thunderstorms</b> in this part are discussed in detail by Koteshwaram and Srinivasan (1958), Raman and Raghavan (1961), and Krishna Rao (1966). In this paper, we report observations made during three short-duration <b>thunderstorms</b> occurred in this region with very high peak flash rates (about 80 flashes per minute). Possible causes of such high lightning flash rates in these <b>thunderstorms</b> are discussed.|$|R
5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a <b>thunderstorm</b> {{approaching}} from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the <b>thunderstorm.</b> The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the <b>thunderstorm.</b> This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by <b>thunderstorm</b> downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the <b>thunderstorm,</b> {{destroying}} its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the <b>thunderstorm,</b> fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Thunderstorms</b> {{are most}} common in {{southern}} and eastern England, and least common {{in the north and}} west. In London, <b>thunderstorms</b> occur on average 1419 days a year, while in most of Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland <b>thunderstorms</b> occur on around 3 days a year. Occasionally, <b>thunderstorms</b> can be severe and produce large hailstones as seen in Ottery St Mary, Devon in October 2008, where drifts reached [...]|$|R
30|$|Surface {{electric}} measurements obtained beneath <b>thunderstorms</b> with almost similar characteristics at a station located {{close to the}} Himalayan foothills in northeastern India have been analyzed. All these <b>thunderstorms</b> had some similar features - occurred after midnight and lasted for a short duration of less than an hour, and an active stage of these <b>thunderstorms</b> lasted for 10 to 25  min. All these <b>thunderstorms</b> exhibited very high peak flash rates ranging from 40 to 80 flashes per minute during the active stage. A lightning jump of about 65 flashes per minute (fpm) was observed during two occurrences of these <b>thunderstorms.</b> Surprisingly, in spite of very high peak lightning flash rates and lightning jumps, no severe weather phenomena were observed at the ground during these <b>thunderstorms.</b> The formation of such small duration <b>thunderstorms</b> with very high lightning flash rates is attributed to the conversion of moisture in the valley during nighttime.|$|R
5000|$|Convective - Issued for {{an area of}} <b>thunderstorms</b> {{affecting}} an area of 3000 sq mi or greater, a line of <b>thunderstorms</b> {{at least}} 60 nmi km long, and/or severe or embedded <b>thunderstorms</b> affecting any area {{that are expected to}} last 30 minutes or longer.|$|R
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the <b>thunderstorm</b> {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the <b>thunderstorm.</b> The downdraft will push down out of the <b>thunderstorm,</b> hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the <b>thunderstorm,</b> the updraft disappears and the <b>thunderstorm</b> will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the <b>thunderstorm</b> which produced the tornado. Although a severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E

30|$|Our {{observations}} of electric field made beneath <b>thunderstorms</b> at Guwahati, known for occurrence of severe <b>thunderstorms</b> during pre-monsoon season - locally known as ‘Nor’wester’, show that high lightning flash rates and lightning jumps {{can happen in}} small <b>thunderstorms</b> without causing any severe weather phenomenon at ground. This study also brings {{out the fact that}} many severe <b>thunderstorms</b> occur over this region during late evening/night hours, which can be attributed to moisture conversions at the foothills due to radiative cooling.|$|R
5|$|The <b>thunderstorm</b> {{that would}} {{eventually}} produce the infamous F3tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe <b>thunderstorm</b> warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through {{the entirety of the}} supercell. At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating <b>thunderstorm</b> while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along Interstate 820. Winds from the downdraft of another small <b>thunderstorm</b> south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further. At 6:10p.m. (00:10UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the Fort Worth a minute later.|$|E
5|$|A back-building <b>thunderstorm,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as a training <b>thunderstorm,</b> is a <b>thunderstorm</b> in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe <b>thunderstorm</b> and tornado warning, as well as the severe <b>thunderstorm</b> and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5000|$|Mesocyclones are localized, {{approximately}} 2 km to 10 km {{in diameter}} within strong <b>thunderstorms.</b> <b>Thunderstorms</b> containing persistent mesocyclones are supercell <b>thunderstorms.</b> Mesocyclones {{occur on the}} [...] "mesoscale" [...] from a few kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. Doppler radar is used to identify mesocyclones. A mesovortex is a similar but typically smaller and weaker rotational feature associated with squall lines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{convective}} scale ensemble forecasting {{is performed}} {{by combining the}} mesoscale non-hydrostatic Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Institute ofAtmospheric Physics (IAP) 3 -D convective cloud model based on the ensemble weather forecast theory and applied to the forecast {{of the characteristics of}} <b>thunderstorms</b> around Nan Jing. The ensemble forecasting of the <b>thunderstorms</b> is verified with the summer Doppler radar data of the <b>thunderstorms</b> in Nan Jing. Results show that the intensity and distribution of <b>thunderstorms</b> over the research area is reasonably predicted one day in advance. It is particularly good to forecast the distribution of the strong <b>thunderstorms</b> with the ensemble forecasting technique. Moreover, the reasonable explanation and application of the convective scale ensemble forecasting is of much importance for the early warning and monitoring of the local <b>thunderstorms</b> and mitigation of the thunder calamity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{six different}} <b>thunderstorms</b> affecting wind {{farms in the}} Basque Country. In this work, single-flash <b>thunderstorms</b> are discussed. The term single-flash is used in order to refer <b>thunderstorms</b> that leave very few or even only one lightning flash. Those flashes affected to the tall structures. The lightning impacts have been detected using different technologies in two separate lightning detection and location networks. Depending on the peak current estimated by the lightning detection sensors, most of the detections can be classified as upward leaders initiated by the wind turbines in presence of a thundercloud. Both cold and warm season <b>thunderstorms</b> are considered. A complete characterization of the <b>thunderstorms</b> using data from lightning detections networks and weather radar is providedPostprint (published version...|$|R
5|$|If the {{quantity}} of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a <b>thunderstorm</b> can be calculated.

Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
50|$|In Area Control Centers, a major weather {{problem is}} <b>thunderstorms,</b> which present {{a variety of}} hazards to aircraft.
