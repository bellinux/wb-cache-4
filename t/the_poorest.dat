5|$|Mississippi was <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> {{state in}} the U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} were some of <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E

5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> {{parts of the country}} where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office.
