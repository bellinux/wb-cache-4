500|$|Solo {{includes}} fifteen tracks, some previously released. Recording sessions {{took place}} from November 8 to 10, 2005, at The Hit Factory and Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. There are four improvised tracks inspired by John Coltrane's Giant Steps: [...] "Paseo Iluminado", [...] "Paseo en Media Luz", [...] "Paseo Azul", and [...] "Paseo Morado". [...] "Iluminado (Improv #1)", according to Roberto R. Calder of PopMatters, has [...] "stock phrasing, but {{a pause in}} concentration before the sublime quality of a one-minute lullaby worth waiting for"; [...] "Media Luz (Improv #2)" [...] "hints at jazz with concert-room sonorities and a striking ending"; [...] "Azul (Improv #3)" [...] "proceeds with more consistent direction than its two predecessors" [...] and becomes a hymn"; and [...] "Morado (Improv #4)" [...] "develops into long linear passages for each hand." [...] "Faro" [...] is a track with [...] "a simple ostinato bass, a <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> and a loud climax." [...] The opening track, [...] "Rezo", is an interlude inspired {{by the work of}} French composer Claude Debussy and American performer Duke Ellington, and is [...] "based on Afro-Cuban melodies sung during Santería rites." [...] "Silencio" [...] is a tribute to Cuban boleros. [...] "Prologo (Prologue to a Fantasy)" [...] features a [...] "congenial intellectual playfulness alternating between something like Spanish piano music of a century ago, and the dance-hall." [...] "Bésame Mucho" [...] was first included on the 1991 album The Blessing, Rubalcaba's first recording to be issued in the United States, and the version was named by Scott Yanow of Allmusic a [...] "highlight" [...] of the album, including accompaniment from Haden on bass guitar and drummer Jack DeJohnette. A reworked version is included on Solo, and is described as having an [...] "intensely meditative character and slow deliberation," [...] and [...] "a more complex higher level of communication" [...] than the original version. [...] "Here's That Rainy Day" [...] is a jazz ballad, recorded earlier for the album Inner Voyage, with an arrangement described as [...] "breathtaking" [...] by Ken Dryden of Allmusic. The first version of [...] "Quasar" [...] can be found on Paseo (2004); and the version included on Solo is described as [...] "seven minutes of drama," [...] by Calder of PopMatters, with [...] "a sprawling, improv-heavy composition that runs Rubalcaba up and down the keyboard." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Bartók's “Continental” 1942 {{recording}} of Improvisations op. 20 {{provides us with}} invaluable insights into his aesthetics and nature. This is a special case study in which Bartók redesign the composition through his performance. In this rendition the simple structure {{of most of the}} eight pieces that construct the composition (alternations between arrangements of the Hungarian peasant songs and <b>transitions</b> <b>section</b> in between them), turn into temperamental micro-drama of associations, flowing without any hesitations from Bartók's mind to his fingers. The folk song arrangements are played in various performing styles, related directly to the written texture, while the <b>transition</b> <b>sections</b> played in more personal style. Here, in these transitional sections, Bartók the romantic, emotional pianist is revealed. These transitions are used by him as improvisatory pauses, used mainly for musical reflections dealing with his performance style of the preceded folk song arrangement or the one that follows. The current article introduces and examines some of the insights evoked by Bartók's {{recording of}} this composition...|$|R

5000|$|A third bus {{used for}} {{compositing}} {{is the key}} bus. A mixer can {{have more than one}} key bus, but often they share only one set of buttons. Here, one signal can be selected for keying over the program (or background) bus. The digital on-screen graphic image that will be seen in the program is called the fill, while the mask used to cut the key's translucence is called the source. This source, e.g. chrominance, luminance, pattern (the internal pattern generator is used) or split (an additional video signal similar to an alpha channel is used) and can be selected in the keying section of the mixer. Note that instead of the key bus, other video sources can be selected for the fill signal, but the key bus is usually the most convenient method for selecting a key fill. Usually, a key is turned on and off the same way a transition is. For this, the <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> can be switched from program mode to key mode. Often, the <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> allows background video and one or more keyers to be transitioned separately or in any combination with one push of the [...] "auto" [...] button.|$|E

This is particularly difficult to perform, due to the technique needed to accurately and quickly execute the running octave patterns. The scherzo then moves into a <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> that leads {{back to the main}} theme. The following, singing style (cantabile) section is in D-flat major. The main theme and its sequences begin with strong chords that hold the melody followed by a downward flutter of notes. There follows a brief section consisting of a series of arpeggios. The elements of this lyrical section repeat themselves a few times and the piece then moves back into the main theme.|$|E

50|$|The overture, in D {{major and}} common time, is in a {{modified}} sonata {{form in which}} the development is but a very short <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> connecting the exposition with the recapitulation. Other conventional hallmarks of the sonata form are apparent: the exposition modulates from the tonic (D major) to the dominant (A major), while the recapitulation is centred on the tonic. The overture concludes with a coda ending in D major chords. These chords, soft and tentative, turn {{out not to be}} a resolution of the overture in the tonic but chords in the dominant of G minor, which is the home key of the scene that immediately follows.|$|E

The <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> from Paynes Landing to Orange Springs consists of flooded standing timber and areas of floating vegetation. The pool section from Orange Springs to Kirkpatrick Dam, including the river channel and the extant Cross Florida Barge Canal, consists of floating and submersed vegetation, dead standing timber and submersed and partially submersed trees and stumps. The discontinued Barge Canal and the existing river channel have water depths up to 30 feet deep. Submersed vegetation (hydrilla, coontail and eel grass) is common in the pool section of the reservoir. Drawdowns are conducted every {{three to four years}} on the reservoir for aquatic plant control and fish and wildlife habitat enhancement.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{main feature}} of a vision mixer is the {{transition}} lever, also called a T-bar or Fader Bar. This lever, similar to an audio fader, {{is used to}} transition between two buses. Note that in a flip-flop mixer, {{the position of the}} main transition lever does not indicate which bus is active, since the program bus is always the active or hot bus. Instead of moving the lever by hand, a button (commonly labeled [...] "mix", [...] "auto" [...] or [...] "auto trans") can be used, which performs the transition over a user-defined period of time. Another button, usually labeled [...] "cut" [...] or [...] "take", swaps the preview signal to the program signal instantaneously.

5000|$|The movement's {{principal}} theme, {{introduced by}} the strings and marked [...] "cantabile", is an almost exact quotation from Agnus Dei from Mozart's Coronation Mass; a resemblance to [...] "God Save the King" [...] has also been noted. The second theme is in the dominant (C major). The exposition is not repeated. Instead there is a <b>transition</b> <b>section</b> into the development. It is in this transition that the quotation from Mozart's Symphony No. 41 ("Jupiter") appears. The recapitulation involves new treatments of the principal theme: on its first reprise, the theme {{is accompanied by a}} passage for solo cello in counterpoint. After the second theme is reprised, the oboes present the first theme again. Six measures {{from the end of the}} movement, the first two measures of the theme are presented for a final time, by an oboe and a bassoon with a chromatic accompaniment from the strings. The movement then fades to a pianissimo conclusion. The chromaticism accompanying the final statement of the theme was omitted from published editions of the symphony until the 1950s, when H. C. Robbins Landon restored Haydn's original score.Haydn went on to quote the Agnus Dei of Mozart's Coronation Mass even more exactly in the Agnus Dei of his own Harmoniemesse, and his scoring reflects that of the Adagio in his Symphony 98.|$|E
