25|$|White <b>turkey</b> <b>meat</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} healthier than dark meat {{because of its}} lower fat content, but the nutritional differences are small.

25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the <b>turkey</b> <b>meat.</b> Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E

500|$|Bernard Matthews {{had been}} {{importing}} 38tons of partly processed <b>turkey</b> <b>meat</b> {{on a weekly}} basis from their Saga Foods company, in Sárvár, Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies [...] from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a company director admitted it was [...] "possible" [...] that some of the meat could have come from the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, Whitehall expressed concern over biosecurity and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain. On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks. On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with EU regulations being cited as the reason why a transport ban could not be imposed.|$|E
2500|$|Wild turkeys, while {{technically}} {{the same}} species as domestic turkeys, {{have a very different}} taste from farm-raised turkeys. In contrast to domestic turkeys, almost all wild <b>turkey</b> <b>meat</b> is [...] "dark" [...] (even the breast) and more intensely flavored. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild <b>turkey</b> <b>meat</b> with a gamier flavor in late summer due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkey that has fed predominantly on grass and grain has a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.|$|E
2500|$|In Aztec times, two {{or three}} corn tortillas would be eaten with each meal, either plain or dipped in mole or a chili pepper and water sauce.

25|$|In {{addition}} to a difference in culinary characteristics, heritage turkeys are often {{considered to be a}} healthier food; {{as a result of the}} diet of pasture-raised <b>turkeys,</b> heritage <b>meat</b> contains far higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent heart disease.|$|R
2500|$|Another program {{executed}} by LDWF involves creating a market of nutria meat for human consumption, {{though it is}} still trying to gain public notice.

40|$|Acid {{solutions}} {{have been}} used as antimicrobials on meat and poultry. FreshFx is a commercially-available surface treatment for the reduction of pathogens and extension of shelf life of raw poultry. Two replicate trials were conducted to determine the effect of FreshFx on numbers of total aerobes and inoculated Salmonella on raw <b>turkey</b> breast <b>meat</b> during 14 d of refrigerated storage. In each trial, three <b>turkey</b> breast <b>meat</b> cutlets, obtained at retail, were inoculated with nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella and cut in half. One half was dipped in FreshFx for 30 s and the other half dipped in water for 30 s as a control, then all cutlet halves were refrigerated at 4 °C and sampled at 0, 1, 2, 7, 10 and 14 d for total aerobic bacteria and Salmonella. No reduction (P> 0. 05) in numbers of total aerobes or Salmonella was observed due to FreshFx. Mean log cfu for total aerobes was 7. 1 on d 0 and 7. 8 on d 14. Mean pooled Salmonella log cfu were 6. 9 on d 0 and 5. 1 on d 14. Total aerobe counts were artificially high on d 0 to 10 due to the large numbers of Salmonella initially inoculated onto the samples. The persistence of Salmonella on samples during refrigerated storage reinforces the concept of reducing or eliminating pathogens prior to packaging and cold storage. In this experiment FreshFx did not improve shelf life as measured by reduction of total aerobes during refrigerated storage, nor reduce numbers of inoculated Salmonella on raw <b>turkey</b> breast <b>meat...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Turkey</b> {{manure and}} <b>meat</b> bone have {{potential}} uses as fuel in conventional power plants. It is commonly agreed that problems can arise from uncommonly high contents of chlorine, sulfur, and alkali metals in <b>turkey</b> manure and <b>meat</b> bone, including corrosion, fouling, and inactivation of catalysts and membranes. Numerous {{studies have focused}} on the reactions of inorganics from combustion and pyrolysis of meat bone, and the thermochemical conversion of turkey manure has been in investigated to a much lesser extent.

In the present study, <b>turkey</b> manure and <b>meat</b> bone are gasified under temperature conditions of entrained flow gasification (1673 K).
