40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern that the}} threat of terrorism in a global environment increasingly reliant on computer networks and information technology is growing and that the very networks and information technology which have been responsible for the dramatic increases in productivity within the world economy may also carry with them even greater capacities to do harm. In this paper we argue that understanding terrorism within the new cyber environment of the twenty-first century is best enhanced by building on what we have learned about terrorists and terrorism in the previous twenty centuries. In short, we believe that the underlying principles of the <b>terrorism</b> <b>behind</b> the threat remain the same. Terrorism is a process that involves acts or threats, emotional reactions and the social effects of the acts or threats and the resultant actions. Terrorism in a cyber setting involves all of the above components within a rapidly changing technological environment which influences terrorist resources and opportunities. These changes directly affect terrorist tactics, targets and weapons and have spawned growing discussion of a new terrorist tactic called “cyber terrorism”...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{the issue}} of leaving <b>terrorism</b> <b>behind</b> is a widely {{discussed}} but poorly understood subject. When compared to the extensive body of literature {{on the process of}} radicalization, research on terrorist desistance is both theoretically and conceptually lagging behind. As a consequence, policy makers and practitioners are currently operating in a theoretical vacuum. This article aims to address the pressing need for {{a better understanding of the}} discontinuance of terrorism by introducing a social identity perspective to the existing field of re-search. Social identity can be understood as the part of an individual’s self-concept that is derived from membership within personally relevant social groups. As such, the concept of social identity is vital to making sense of the identity transformation intrinsic to walking away from terrorism. Exploring the role of social identity in terrorist desistance gives prominence to the intersection between the individual and the social group. Framing terrorist dis-continuance as a process that emanates from the interface between individual and group-level mechanisms corresponds to the interactive nature of rebuilding a life after terrorism. Additionally, the explanatory value of a social identity perspective has already been demonstrated in the field of radicalisation research. Extending this theoretical framework to the subject of terrorist desistance enables us to connect the dots between two processes that are inherently linked, though frequently analysed as isolated entities...|$|E

No buts. It’s just plain wrong” Home Secretary, John Reid 1 October 2006 Terrorist violence {{has a long history}} in Britain, and the legal measures adopted to counter the threat are also long standing, even though in recent years they have been considerably expanded. In the period since 9 / 11 what appeared like archaic debates about state power, civil liberties and discourse and politics of national security are back on the agenda. After the tragic events in New York and Washington 11 September 2001, Britain left the idea of the Terrorism Act 2000 as a single and comprehensive legislation, capable of handling the threat of <b>terrorism,</b> <b>behind,</b> and introduced the controversial Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, enacted a mere 3 months later. Since then two more pieces of legislation has followed. Since 9 / 11 Britain intensified its counter-terrorism efforts on all levels. Some of these measures have been among the most discussed issues in British politics in recent years, especially the derogations of civil liberties. This is an important discussion as the essence of civil liberties, personal and political rights really are the foundation of the liberal democracy we cherish...|$|E
40|$|De-radicalisation {{has become}} {{increasingly}} prevalent in the UK’s counter-terrorism policy as a strategy for tackling the threat of religiously inspired violence/extremism. Recently, British citizens fighting in Middle Eastern conflicts have rekindled the preoccupation of policymakers with the radicalisation of British Muslims. In fact the work of PREVENT post 2011 has primarily been recalibrated towards a greater focus on de-radicalisation interventions, which is delivered by the police through the Channel programme. Channel is perceived by policy-makers {{to be a more}} streamlined and effective way of dealing with radicalised/extremist individuals than the wide remit of PREVENT initiatives between 2006 and 2010. Indeed since becoming placed on a statutory footing in 2015, PREVENT requires public institutions, like schools and universities, to identify ‘vulnerable’ individuals’ at risk of radicalisation. And yet despite the greater attention on de-radicalisation, very little continues to be known about what makes violent individuals leave <b>terrorism</b> <b>behind.</b> De-radicalisation in PREVENT is characterised by the absence of credible research, little or no empirical evidence for policy development, confusion surrounding its conceptual framework, and conflicting policy logics. The following thesis is based on a case-study examination of de-radicalisation with 27 PREVENT practitioners. Through qualitative semi-structured interviews, my investigation seeks to address the problems that arise from the concept and practice of de-radicalisation in PREVENT by ascertaining (a) an ontological understanding of de-radicalisation and (b) the practice of de-radicalisation. The findings of the fieldwork data revealed the existence of multiple conceptions of de-radicalisation and a number of conceptual features unique to the UK context. Despite yielding a more fruitful conceptual and empirical understanding of de-radicalisation, the data in itself nevertheless could not fully explicate the relationship between several critical themes comprehensively within an analytically generative framework. With the inductive method falling short, I draw on Michel Foucault’s concept of the ‘technologies of the self’. Comprising of discursive, disciplinary, and confessional technologies, it is argued that the technologies of the self allows us to reframe the concept beyond the narrow confines of counter-terrorism policy and place it within wider governmental relations. Situated within neo-liberal governmentality, the technologies of the self encourage individuals to work on themselves and regulate their behaviour through a wide range of discursive, practical, and technical interventions. Seen in this way, de-radicalisation is therefore less about the mitigation of violence and more about the making of a particular political and ethical subjectivity. Ultimately, the technology of the self eschews the conceptual problems inherent in the PREVENT conception of de-radicalisation, the limitations evident in the literature, whilst amplifying the salient findings of my fieldwork data. It provides a more robust concept and theory that successfully captures and explains de-radicalisation in the UK context. This thesis thus makes an original contribution to knowledge by (1) being the first study to gather primary data on de-radicalisation in the UK; (2) offering an alternative concept of de-radicalisation; and (3) contributing to theories on the governmentality of radicalisation policies, focusing on the micro-politics of identity in neoliberal governance...|$|E

While a multitude of books have been published on the topic of terrorism, violence, and war, the sociology of terrorism remains a relatively new field and an under-studied area. A sociological analysis of terrorism questions who is a terrorist as well as who decides who is a terrorist. Since terrorist acts are often justified by a perceived notion of social or political oppression, we must recognise the societal structures that create these perceptions, and also the social divides that exist between and within societies-differing political, ideological, cultural, and religious worldviews. As such, it is imperative that we look to the reasons <b>behind</b> <b>terrorism,</b> that we attempt to learn why and how terrorism occurs. 2 nd ed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} how distrust towards an out-group {{believed to be}} an actor of a conspiracy theory moderates the role of Islamic identification, group incompatibility and competitive victimhood in explaining belief in said conspiracy.

More precisely, we found only among Muslim participants with high distrust towards Western people that Islamic identification and group incompatibility positively predicted the perception that Muslims, more than other religious groups, are the victim of the Western people and the belief in a theory that these people have conspired to create terrorism in Indonesia. We also hypothesized and found that competitive victimhood significantly mediated the effects of Islamic identification and group incompatibility on the belief in a conspiracy theory. However, in line with the prediction, these mediation roles of victimhood were obtained only among participants with high distrust. We discussed these findings with reference to theoretical and practical implications...|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalThe thesis {{suggests}} that homeland security personnel lack a uniform method to make sound and defensible ethical decisions. Building on {{a foundation of}} classical ethical thought, it is established that ethics {{are essential to the}} work of homeland security. Philosophical underpinnings include virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, decision-making practices, and values common to the homeland security enterprise. Real-world case studies were examined in an attempt to understand and demonstrate what can happen if ethics are neglected, considered incompletely or incorrectly, or thoughtfully applied. Case studies include the response to Hurricane Katrina, motivation and thought <b>behind</b> <b>terrorism,</b> and the discussion on torture. Examples of good ethics programs were analyzed, including the Canadian Defense Ethics Program and the Wildfire Fire Leadership Development Program. From this research, a conceptual framework for understanding was developed. The DRIVE framework (Duty, Respect, Integrity, Vision, Ends/Expected outcomes) is proposed to give homeland security personnel the tools necessary to evaluate a situation, make a decision, and review it retrospectively. The framework is easy to remember, flexible to allow for individual differences, yet comprehensive enough to encompass classical ethical thought, common values, and decision-making. The thesis recommends developing an ethics-training program for homeland security, using DRIVE as a foundation. Captain, Unified Fire Authority of Greater Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, Uta...|$|R
40|$|This article {{questions}} {{the utility of}} the term ‘radicalization’ as a focus for counter-terrorism response in the UK. It argues that the lack of clarity as to who the radicalized are has helped to facilitate a ‘Prevent’ strand of counterterrorism strategy that has confusingly oscillated between tackling violent extremism, in particular, to promoting community cohesion and ‘shared values’ more broadly. The article suggests that the focus of counterterrorism strategy should be on countering terrorism and not on the broader remit implied by wider conceptions of radical-ization. This is not to diminish the importance of contextual or ‘root cause’ factors <b>behind</b> <b>terrorism,</b> but, if it is terrorism that is to be understood and countered, then such factors should be viewed within the terrorism-counterterrorism discourse and not a radicalization-counter-radicalization one. The article goes on to consider the characterization of those presenting a terrorist threat to the UK as being ‘vulnerable’ to violent extremism. While it argues that the notion of vulnerable individuals and communities also lends itself to a wider ‘Prevent’ remit, it cautions that the impetus towards viewing terrorism as the product of vulnerability should not deflect us from what has generally been agreed in terrorism studies—that terrorism involves the perpetration of rational and calculated acts of violence...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{a major factor in}} {{terrorist}} acts is an appeal to the actor's own community at an emotional and symbolic level, through acts of sacrifice, particularly self-sacrifice. Although other aims also exist, a prime concern is to recall the actor's home audience to the struggle, because the actor regards himself as acting on their behalf. This utilizes the imagery and symbolism of traditional religion, implying a strong communal and non-material impetus to terrorist acts, rather than rational material calculation, that modern Western man finds difficult to comprehend. It also recalls much classical social theory, which emphasized the central role of religion in community. Self-sacrifice tells an emotional story to the actor's community that is comprehensible to them and will have an emotional appeal to maintaining the community. For the Northern Ireland hunger strikes (possibly analogous to suicide bombers) this is reflected in their appeal solely to a Catholic/nationalist community that equates strongly with ideas of a pre-modern society under threat from a modernizing society. All the hunger strikers were very normal for their community, but left non-Catholics completely unmoved. Consequently {{there is a need to}} understand the communal dynamics <b>behind</b> <b>terrorism</b> if one is to effectively counter the threat and that different societies may have different values regarding the individual, community, and life itself. Individual motivations do not provide an adequate explanation for much terrorism and it is a failure to grasp this that severely hinders much counterterrorism...|$|R

The paper also treats the origin of the word ‘terrorism’, back to the French Revolution of 1789 as the label used by the establishment to describe the conduct of revolutionaries. In this paper will be treated the main factors that have affected over the creation and development of terrorism, the content, format and main characteristics of terrorism, the main forms of occurrence of terrorist acts and Albanian legal mechanisms in the fight against terrorism, including the International agreements of which Albania is part of. Special attention will be paid to the moment when terrorist activities started in Albania and which are the most common forms of terror in Albania. The study of terrorism is multi-disciplinary, spanning a number of fields including political science, psychology, criminology, sociologist, history and many others. There are not few criminal norms provided in the Albanian Criminal Code that condemn terrorism. The Albanian Criminal Code expresses in separated articles the punishment of everyone who finances terrorism, hides funds and other assets that finance terrorism, even collects funds for terrorism financing, recruits persons for committing acts of terrorism or for terrorist financing, trains for committing terrorism acts, or makes public calls with terrorist purposes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{different social}} aspects of terrorists and terrorist organizations {{in an effort}} to better deal with terrorism, especially in the long run. The researcher, who also worked as a Police Captain at Turkish National Police Anti-Terrorism Department, seeks solutions to today's global problem by studying both literature and a Delphi examination of a survey of 1070 imprisoned terrorists. The research questions include questions such as "What are the reasons behind terrorism?", "Why does terrorism occur?", "What ideologies provide the framework for terrorist violence?, "Why do some individuals become terrorists and others do not?" and "Under what conditions will terrorists end their violence?" The results of the study presents the complexity of the terrorism problem as a social experience and impossibility of a single solution or remedy for the global problem of terrorism. The researcher through his examination of the findings of the data, presented that terrorism is a social phenomenon with criminal consequences that needs to be dealt by means of two dimensional approaches. The first is the social dimension of terrorism and the second is the criminal dimension of terrorism. Based on this, the researcher constructed a conceptual model which addresses both of these dimensions under the titles of long-term solutions and short-term solutions. The long-term solutions deal with the social aspects of terrorism under the title of Proactive Approach to Terrorism and the short-term solutions deal with the criminal aspects of terrorism under the title of The Immediate Fight against Terrorism. The researcher constructed this model because {{there seems to be a}} tendency of not asking the question of "Why does terrorism occur?" Instead, the focus is usually on dealing with the consequences of terrorism and future terrorist threats. While it is essential that the governments need to provide the finest security measures for their societies, at the same time they need to address the reasons <b>behind</b> <b>terrorism.</b> This research, from stated perspective, offered a conceptual model to address both aspects of terrorism for a more complete fight against today's most painful problem...|$|R
