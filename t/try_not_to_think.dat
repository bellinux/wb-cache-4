500|$|The band {{spoke on}} their Facebook page {{and said they}} started {{recording}} new material on October 20. On January 16, 2012, they revealed track names for the new EP on Facebook. Initially, rumors spread {{about the possibility of}} Down releasing four EPs, instead of an album. However, when asked about it in an interview with Scuzz TV, Anselmo said that [...] "It would be too pretentious, we <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> as far ahead as that, and just go with what we feel at the time." [...] In the summer of 2013, Kirk Windstein quit the band and was replaced by Bobby Landgraf. Down IV– Part II was released on May 13, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, {{said he would like to}} try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
2500|$|Ironic control theory, {{also known}} as [...] "ironic process theory", states that thought {{suppression}} [...] "leads to an increased occurrence of the suppressed content in waking states". The irony {{lies in the fact}} that although people <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about a particular subject, there is a high probability that it will appear in one's dreams regardless. There is a difference for individuals who have a higher tendency of suppression; they are more prone to psychopathological responses such as [...] "intrusive thoughts, including depression, anxiety and obsessional thinking". Due to these individuals having higher instances of thought suppression, they experience dream rebound more often.|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 1998, a {{gathering}} of local people and former American and Vietnamese soldiers stood together at {{the place of the}} My Lai massacre in Vietnam to commemorate its 30th anniversary. American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl {{at the time of the}} massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, [...] "We don't say we forget. We just <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that". Colburn challenged Lieutenant Calley, [...] "...to face the women we faced today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the tears in their eyes and tell them why it happened". No American diplomats nor any other officials attended the meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Fahima Haque of The Washington Post, Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian, and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all {{reiterate}} {{the fact}} that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins's assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans. Adewunmi remarked that [...] "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: {{you may be a}} racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight." [...] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: [...] "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I {{want to thank all of}} my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty." [...] Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying [...] "I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet" [...] and [...] "It's sad... We could now see where society is today. But I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about stuff like that." ...|$|E

He had exhausted the fact before it happened. Since first he had thought of it there had passed four long years, and in that time he had seen it from every aspect, exhausted every possibility. It had become a theoretical possibility, the basis of continually less confident, continually more unsubstantial day dreams.
