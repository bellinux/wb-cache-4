As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads [...] "...

2500|$|There is {{not much}} choice. There is not, because we screwed up. [...] Not a little, a lot. [...] No European country has done {{something}} as boneheaded as we have. [...] Evidently, we lied throughout the last year-and-a-half, two years. [...] It was totally clear {{that what we are}} saying is not true. [...] You cannot quote any significant government measure we can be proud of, other than at the end we managed to bring the government back from the brink. Nothing. If we have to give account to the country about what we did for four years, <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> we say? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> {{you think}} that they meant?" [...] cried De Catinat impatiently. [...] "For heaven's sake, let us come to some conclusion, for every minute is of importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you reckon she did? Why, {{she turned}} on that smirking Spanish fool like a wildcat, and out with a 'navy' and shot him dead in open court!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> you do then?" [...] {{demanded the}} stranger, rising {{from his seat}} with sudden energy, his voice deep, insistent, masterful. [...] "Tell me what you did?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{undoubtedly}} {{you were}} right; {{it must have}} been gratification; it could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger with such a question as that. <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> you do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I little {{know how}} you got into this fix, but I mean to find out," [...] said Marilla. [...] "Come {{right down to the}} kitchen--it's too cold up here--and tell me just <b>what</b> you've <b>done.</b> I've been expecting {{something}} queer for some time. You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due. Now, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> you do to your hair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All {{these things}} I know, I know. [...] And that's why {{my heart is}} breaking!' [...] <b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you gain by pretending so? [...] 'The joy of an old wound waking.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? What {{is such a}} one likely to do? But <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> I do, as it is? It {{is the sort of}} life you would like,--if you were a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{can manage}} that, sooner or later. The main thing is, we must watch our chances and strike {{as soon as}} the right moment arrives. Now <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you say, Shepley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did {{you come}} riding over here for, <b>then?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> you take all this risk for? Why did you rush over here to share my disgrace--for YOU are as much mixed up with this now as I am--if you didn't {{calculate}} to share EVERYTHING ELSE with me? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> you come here for, then, if not for ME?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said just}} what you said when you were {{speaking}} of Missouri a while ago, that {{he was afraid of}} guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly over. I signed 'em.

6000|$|... "Neither {{did your}} father, {{or he would}} not have been so foolish as to sell {{everything}} he had for money. By the way, it's lucky for you he did not sell this bedstead. Now, <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And all {{the time}} that he was pouring forth those supplications, his eyes searched and searched her face. But there only came from her: [...] "I don't know--I can't tell--if only I knew!"

40|$|Venture philanthropy {{combines}} {{the principles of}} venture capital investment with traditional grant making.

6000|$|... "And I {{had to go}} {{over the}} whole {{proposal}} twice, and word it as plainly as A B C, before she would fully take it in. And <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> she do?

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> {{you think}} St. Nicholas did? In his hand {{he held a}} little plug of wood, and no sooner had Ill-Luck entered the nut than he stuck the plug in the hole, and there was man's enemy as tight as fly in a bottle.|$|E
60|$|By and by Johnny Chuck {{really did}} find some clover--just the sweetest clover that {{grew in the}} Green Meadows. Johnny Chuck ate and ate and ate and <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think he did? Why, he curled right up in the nice sweet clover and went fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrade Jarvis," [...] he said, [...] "I {{fear that}} as a smoking-concert {{this is not going}} to be a success. I understand, however. Comrade Repetto and his colleagues have come here on business, and nothing will make them forget it.

You just show me what you've wrote about me.

That ain't proper writing. I can't read that.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he has {{the wish}} but not the strength, <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> we fear?"

6000|$|... “And <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think? That Stafford {{begins to}} tear his hair. Just so. Tugs {{at it with}} both hands without saying anything.
