25|$|Opponents of {{free trade}} charge that Friedman does not {{consider}} the purchasing power of domestic labor as a key driver in economic output.

He theorizes {{that as long as}} those whose jobs are outsourced continue to further their education and specialize in their field, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> better-paying and higher-skilled jobs.|$|E

25|$|In {{optimization}} problems, heuristic algorithms {{can be used}} to find {{a solution}} close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting {{closer and closer to the}} optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.|$|E

In the days that follow, while looking at the {{underside}} of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> a way to move on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping in the backseat, Edward stops the car at an intersection. Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station, implying he is about to leave their car and turn himself in.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic {{reaction}} towards magic did not condemn {{magic in}} general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and possession, and sorcery. Magic is therefore a special gift from God, while the latter is achieved through help of Jinn and devils. Ibn al-Nadim hold, Exorcists gain their power by their obedience to God, while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobidience and sacrifices and they in return do him a favor. Being pious and strictly follow {{the teachings of the}} Quran can increase the probability to perform magic or miracles. According to Ibn Arabi Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yusuf al-Shubarbuli was due to his piety able to walk on water. Based on the Quran, regarding islamic legends of Solomon, magic was taught by devils to the humans. Solomon took the writings of the sorcerer away and hid them under his throne. After his death, Iblis, unable to get close to Solomons court, told the people, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> a treasure under the throne and thus lead them to sorcery. Another account hold, sorcery came with the fallen angels Harut and Marut to mankind.|$|E

25|$|The {{police also}} have stop and search powers {{which they can}} use if they have {{reasonable}} grounds to believe that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> stolen or prohibited articles or controlled drugs. Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, a senior police officer can authorise police officers in a locality to stop and search any pedestrian or vehicle where the officer has grounds for believing that the individual is carrying an offensive weapon or dangerous instrument. In 1998 this legislation was extended to allow the officer to require the person to remove clothing worn {{for the purpose of}} concealing his identity, and to confiscate that article of clothing. Special extended powers also apply in the case of terrorist suspects. A person may be detained without charge for up to 24 hours, which can be extended for a further 12 hours by a senior officer {{in the case of a}} serious arrestable offence and further extended by a magistrates' court up to a total of 60 hours in respect of indictable offences. Suspected terrorists may be detained for up to 48 hours without charge and immigrants and asylum-seekers may be detained for examination by immigration officers for an unlimited period.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced.

He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E
