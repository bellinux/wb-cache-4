Using "survival analysis" technique, we observed that when the State Governor requesting the loan and the Senator reporting on the matter belong to the same party coalition that helped elect the Governor, loans are approved in less time. On the other hand, approval takes longer if the partisan relationship is broken during the loan review process. Finally, we observed that the more loan applications from a single State in the previous six months, the longer the approval time for a new request.

40|$|The {{judgments}} on the actions respectively brought by Spain against EU Regulation 1257 / 2012 and EU Regulation 1260 / 2012 give {{a green light}} to an unprecedented legislative technique of the EU Institutions, which is labelled here as “empty shell” (taking inspiration from the language of <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>State</b> {{in one of the}} rulings) or “outsourcing EU law”. Specifically EU Regulation 1257 / 2012 is the “empty shell” filled with content taken from domestic legislation and some international agreements.

40|$|The EU {{is assumed}} {{to have a strong}} {{top-down}} transformative power over the states applying for membership. But despite intensive research on the EU membership conditionality, the transformative power of the EU in itself has been left curiously understudied. This thesis seeks to change that, and suggests a model based on relational power to analyse and understand how the transformative power is seemingly weaker in the Western Balkans than in Central and Eastern Europe. This thesis shows that the transformative power of the EU is not static but changes over time, based on the relationship between the EU and <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states,</b> rather than on power resources. This relationship is affected by a number of factors derived from both the EU itself and on factors in <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states.</b> As <b>the</b> relationship changes over time, countries and even issues, the transformative power changes with it. The EU is caught in a path dependent like pattern, defined by both previous commitments and the built up foreign policy role as a normative power, and {{on the nature of the}} decision making procedures. This path dependent pattern prevents the EU from actively using its strongest tools when trying to influence and steer <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> regarding reforms and norm transfer, effectively weakening the transformative power. Evidence from elections in Albania and Macedonia show how the domestic electoral stakeholders actively can resist, and even prune, important norms and laws, on best electoral practice, a key feature for the democratic structures required for EU membership. It is also apparent how there are few domestic change agent strong enough to actively promote normative changes, leaving much of the work for the EU. The clientelistic structures of these countries are a key aspect in shaping interests and actions of the political elite. The result is that layers of old and new institutions are created, producing the mixed pattern of reforms observed all over the Western Balkans. By combining the findings at both the EU level and in <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states,</b> this thesis makes both important empirical and theoretical contributions, challenging some core aspects of the Europeanisation literature. ...|$|R

All ten signed association ‘Europe’ {{agreements with the}} EU and all were participants in the EU’s pre-accession strategy to help them prepare for eventual membership. Enlargement was conditional on <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>state</b> meeting certain political and economic conditions set out at the 1992 Copenhagen European Council. These included three political criteria: stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; adherence to the objective of political union; and maintaining the momentum of integration. The economic criteria are similarly divided into three: {{the existence of a}} functioning market economy; capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU; and adherence to the aim of economic and monetary union. There was much debate on the appropriate speed of the enlargement process. It was evident that not all applicant countries would meet the conditions at the same time. It was therefore assumed that enlargement would take place in ‘waves’, with some countries proceeding faster than others. The book aims at addressing the question of how, when, and with whom enlargement should proceed. This involves identifying criteria to be used, which could help in deciding whether countries are ready to join. The book assesses the consequences of enlargement in stages for the EU budget, trade, agricultural trade, firms in countries left out of the enlargement process, foreign direct investment, growth, the location of industry, labour markets and foreign relations.

40|$|Turkey's {{interest}} {{to be part}} of the political and economic union of Europe dates back to the 1950 s, when the idea of European Union (EU) was born. Almost forty years after the first agreement between the two parties, Turkey is still knocking on the EU' s door to become a full member. The EU has stepped into the twenty-first century with the most comprehensive enlargement of its history in process. The process of enlargement of the EU constitutes the most important step in Turkey's relations with the European Union. In order to become a full member in the European Union, <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>state</b> has to fulfill the EU's Copenhagen Criteria, which in the case of Turkey requires major improvements in its economic and political conditions. However, even if Turkey could meet the Copenhagen Criteria, its full membership would probably not be granted due to Turkey's significant cultural and religious differences from the rest of the member states. Turkey's full membership in the European Union would offer enormous advantages for both parties. Turkey's strategic position, which is at the crossroads of Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East, has great significance for the European Union. EU membership for Turkey, on the other hand, would mean an end to its identity problem of where it belongs - in Europe or Asia. Turkey's official candidacy status constitutes a turning point for Turkey's historic dream of being part of Europe economically, politically and socially. Turkey's EU candidacy leaves Turkey important domestic and external challenges. The ability of Turkey to overcome these challenges will determine the prospects for full membership of Turkey in the European Union. Given the changes required for Turkey to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, and the length of time accession negotiations would take once these criteria were met, it IS unlikely Turkey will be admitted to the European Union before 2020.

40|$|From the Introduction]. Enlarging the European Union (EU) is a multi-faceted process, {{marked by}} the {{milestones}} of the application for membership by a state, issuance of {{the opinion of the}} European Commission on that application, a decision by the Council on whether or not to open accession negotiations, conducting those negotiations, and ultimately the entry of the state into the Union. While these are impressive tasks in any situation, the magnitude of the current challenge is reflected in the fact that thirteen states have applications for EU membership pending. The size of this group of <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> has intensified <b>the</b> debate over how to enlarge, and what level of preparedness is required before a state can join the EU.

40|$|Capital {{markets have}} {{undergone}} massive {{changes in the}} past decade; in Western Europe but of course more fundamentally in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). The euro has fostered the transformation of financial systems toward a more market based approach. Its impact in Eastern Europe will be even stronger. To ensure the success of EMU an active and open-market stance is required. The euro increases the cost of failure and thus provides a strong incentive to comply. Repercussion to current members will be stronger, hence, they will not allow any substantial deviation from the consensus economic policy. A common currency fosters capital market integration, liberalisation, deregulation, and consolidation of financial services throughout the currency area. Competition increases and will lead to higher efficiency. More efficient financial markets improve the allocation of capital and hence contribute to long-term growth and prosperity. The main vehicle is more and better investments.

Harvard University has not accepted any transfer students {{in the last few}} years; Columbia accepted only 8% in 2007, and the University of Pennsylvania accepted only 16% in 2008.

40|$|From the Introduction]. Following the {{political}} agreement at Maastricht in December 1991 on {{the contents of}} the Treaty on European Union, there was considerable optimism in the early months of 1992 on the future prospects for Community integration. The Treaty had not wholly resolved the many differences which exist in the Community about the preferred nature and pace of integration but it certainly had seemed to clear much of the ground. It had done so by, on the one hand, specifying the next steps in the process of deepening integration and, on the other hand, opening the way for progress to be made on widening integration. Regarding the deepening, there was the (largely) symbolic creation of the Union, and an array of specific provisions designed to promote both institutional deepening - via measures to enhance the efficiency and democratic nature of the Community/Union - and policy deepening - via extensions and consolidations of the policy responsibilities of the Community/Union. Regarding the widening, it was decided at Maastricht that with the deepening question 'resolved', at least for a while, attention could be turned to <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> and to this end the Commission was asked to present a report to the June 1992 Lisbon Summit on the implications of enlargement for the Community/Union's future development...|$|R

40|$|The largest {{enlargement}} in the EU’s {{history has}} now been completed {{with the addition of}} ten new member states. Admission of the new members was conditional on their achieving the criteria for membership set out at the 1993 Copenhagen European Council for membership. These criteria involved demonstrating broad political and economic fitness for membership. In addition to this, negotiations involved either adopting or promising to adopt the cumulative body of EU law; the acquis communautaire. This paper reflects upon this process {{and the way in which}} it delivers its outcome. The enlargement process is designed to test the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> for EU membership, consequently, <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> are normally very concerned to minimise problems they may have encountered during membership negotiations. However, issues believed to have been resolved can re-emerge, once the goal of membership has been secured. Compliance with membership conditions is often superficial and national interests can, for a period of time, be minimised. In the run up to enlargement, <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> were considered to be responsible for dealing with ethnic complexities within their own borders, but were expected to deliver reforms with respect to protecting the rights of these groups. This paper argues that some of the progress that new members made in response to the conditions laid down by the EU, may be clawed back once enlargement is achieved. Certainly there are indications that, in areas normally outside the EU’s competence such as the treatment of ethnic minorities, progress has come to a halt now accession has been secured. Despite the continued relevance of constructivist internationalist theories for the Eastern enlargement process, these disappointing developments post accession can best be explained by rationalist internationalist theories. Now that the goal of enlargement has been secured and we move into a period of policy implementation, for CEE states some of the material consequences of enlargement have become more evident, at the same time that the EU’s influence over domestic policy in these states via political conditionality has diminished. As such, policy reform reversals in particular areas can be anticipated...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. Integrating {{into the}} European Union {{is a process}} of {{institutional}} choices and subsequent changes in domestic political, economic and legal structures. This has indeed been the case for the new member states that joined the EU in 2004. Firstly, the Copenhague criteria established by the European Council in 1993 set out the obligations on <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states.</b> 1 <b>The</b> political obligations were the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, the respect of human rights and protection of minorities, whereas the economic requirements consisted of a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU. Last, but not least, <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>states</b> had to manifest an ability to incorporate the aquis or “to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union”. 2 The process of translating the acquis communitaire into the domestic legislation and the building up of political and administrative routines for influencing and implementing EU-policies have resulted in an unprecedented and far-reaching re-structuration of political, economic and administrative institutions and norms. For eight of the new EU member states of 2004 that either had been independent or parts of one-party communist states (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Slovenia) or republics in the Soviet Union (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) EU accession ran in tandem with processes of state- and nation building. The rapprochement to the EU and the NATO were parallel to the post communist transformation from authoritarian to democratic rule and rule of law as well as the development from state-controlled to market economies. As a matter of fact, the strong commitment to membership in the EU was motivated by the belief that full integration with the EU would secure progress in the construction of modern liberal democracies and market economies. A high prevalence of organisational change has consequently characterised these states due to both state and nation-building as well as European integration in the 1990 s and 2000 s. Whereas the drawing up of new democratic constitutions in the 1990 s predominantly has been conceived of as domestically driven processes, the integration into the European Union has been portrayed as mainly conditioned from outside. 3 It has more or less been taken as a given that the “EU has, or at least could have, a pervasive influence on the domestic policies of the CEES”, but “only a few analysts have made an effort to ascertain whether the influence of the EU is so ubiquitous as assumed”. 4 Moreover, the domestic insularity of constitution designing has also been questioned since various international organisations exert pressure on how states formulate the basic rules of the political game. 5 This study is situated within this broader academic debate since it aims at analysing how external and internal factors interact in how national parliaments adapt to European integration...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. The {{signing of}} the Joint Declaration on the Establishment of Official Relations between the EEC and COMECON, in June 1988, {{permitted}} the opening up of bilateral relations between the EEC and the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs). Trade and Co-operation Agreements were signed with the CEECs, in fairly rapid succession, shortly thereafter. However, developments continued to be fast-paced and far-reaching – dramatically embodied {{by the collapse of}} the Berlin Wall in 1989 – and many of these agreements were superseded, even before coming into force, by the Europe Agreements, which followed. The European Community, and now the European Union, has struggled to keep up with these developments, and to respond {{in a way that would}} foster the transitions taking place and further the process of European integration, while keeping in mind concerns of the Union and its Member States. In the less than ten years which followed the opening up of relations, all ten CEECs have submitted applications for EU membership. On 15 July 1997 the Commission issued Agenda 2000, which included its opinions on these applications, as well as its view on the impact of enlargement on such areas as the EU budget, economic and social cohesion, and agricultural policy.

"LAMBETH--Shortly {{before the}} closing of the court, Mr. Septimus Luker, the {{well-known}} dealer in ancient gems, carvings, intagli, &c., &c., applied to the sitting magistrate for advice. <b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> <b>stated</b> that he had been annoyed, at intervals throughout the day, by the proceedings of some of those strolling Indians who infest the streets. The persons complained of were three in number. After having been sent away by the police, they had returned again and again, and had attempted to enter the house on pretence of asking for charity. Warned off in the front, they had been discovered again {{at the back of the}} premises. Besides the annoyance complained of, Mr. Luker expressed himself as being under some apprehension that robbery might be contemplated. His collection contained many unique gems, both classical and Oriental, of the highest value. He had only the day before been compelled to dismiss a skilled workman in ivory carving from his employment (a native of India, as we understood), on suspicion of attempted theft; and he felt by no means sure that this man and the street jugglers of whom he complained, might not be acting in concert. It might be their object to collect a crowd, and create a disturbance in the street, and, in the confusion thus caused, to obtain access to the house. In reply to the magistrate, Mr. Luker admitted that he had no evidence to produce of any attempt at robbery being in contemplation. He could speak positively to the annoyance and interruption caused by the Indians, but not to anything else. The magistrate remarked that, if the annoyance were repeated, <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> could summon <b>the</b> Indians to that court, where they might easily be dealt with under the Act. As to the valuables in Mr. Luker's possession, Mr. Luker himself must take the best measures for their safe custody.

50|$|In March 2015, {{one of the}} Mars One finalists, Joseph Roche, stated {{to media}} outlets that he {{believes}} the mission to be a scam. Roche holds doctorate degrees in physics and astrophysics, and shared many of his concerns and criticisms of the mission. These claims include that the organization lied about <b>the</b> number of <b>applicants,</b> <b>stating</b> that 200,000 individuals applied versus Roche's claim of 2,761, and that many of <b>the</b> <b>applicants</b> had paid {{to be put on}} the list. Furthermore, Roche claimed that Mars One is asking finalists for donations from any money earned from guest appearances (which would amount to a minimal portion of the estimated $6 billion required for the mission). Finally, despite being one of 100 finalists, Roche himself has never spoken to any Mars One employee or representative in person, and instead of psychological or psychometric testing as is normal for astronaut candidates (especially for a lengthy, one-way mission), his interview process consisted of a 10-minute Skype conversation.|$|R
