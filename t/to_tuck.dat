25|$|In {{front of}} a record-setting American {{television}} audience, Tuck had a spectacular game in Super Bowl XLII by repeatedly pressuring New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and recording two sacks and a forced fumble. According <b>to</b> <b>Tuck,</b> he and Brady exchanged playful trash talk during especially physical plays. Due to the game's low score, opinions were heavily waged that Tuck was more deserving of the MVP award than quarterback Eli Manning.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able <b>to</b> <b>tuck</b> this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E

The offer was ultimately turned down, {{and the band}} signed a five-album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According <b>to</b> <b>Tuck,</b> they chose Sony because, [...] "We thought that a lot more doors {{would be open to}} us." [...] A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, [...] "4 Words (To Choke Upon)." [...] Daniel Lukes of Decibel Magazine reviewed the EP by stating, [...] "The worst part is that the music itself isn’t all that bad, for the genre." [...] He went on to comment that the band should be [...] "embarrassed" [...] about the release. Zeromag's Josh Joyce complimented the band on [...] "how technical they can get without confusing the kids." ...|$|E

500|$|At the Masters, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Robert Milkins 6–1 in {{the first}} round, before he whitewashed Ricky Walden 6–0 in the quarter-finals, a match that lasted just 57 minutes and 48 seconds. During the match he scored 556 points without reply, a new record in a professional event, beating the previous record of 495 points set by Ding Junhui at the 2007 Premier League Snooker. He defeated Stephen Maguire 6–2 in the semi-finals to reach a record tenth Masters final, surpassing the nine appearances by Stephen Hendry. Facing defending champion Mark Selby in the final, he took a 7–1 lead {{in the first}} session, before going on to a 10–4 victory for his fifth Masters title. On 22 January 2014, the Disciplinary Committee of the WPBSA issued a statement that O'Sullivan {{had been found in}} breach of the association's Members Rules. It fined him £6,000 and ordered him to pay £1,000 in costs over three posts on his personal Twitter account, made in September and October 2013, that it deemed damaging to the image of the sport. The first post related to match-fixing allegations, the second to a suggestion that he had used performance-enhancing drugs, and the third to a tweet that was described as [...] "offensive". The committee fined him an additional £1,000 for making [...] "abusive, insulting and disrespectful" [...] comments to referee Jan Verhaas during the December 2013 qualifying round for the German Masters. The incident arose after Verhaas asked O'Sullivan <b>to</b> <b>tuck</b> his shirt in during the match. O'Sullivan apologised for his conduct with the referee, stating that he felt unwell on the day and that the venue was overly warm.|$|E

Hoods are never tucked into the neck seal as they would be tucked into a wetsuit, as this would compromise the watertight integrity of the seal. Some suits are designed with a second (non-watertight) [...] "warm neck collar" [...] around the neck seal, which allows the flange of a standard wetsuit hood <b>to</b> <b>tuck</b> in around the outside of the seal. This can keep the neck significantly warmer, since the seal itself provides little insulation.|$|E

2500|$|In Brady's {{first playoff}} game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders {{and led the}} Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal. A {{controversial}} play occurred in that game. Trailing by three points in the fourth quarter, Brady {{lost control of the}} ball after being hit by Raiders' cornerback Charles Woodson. Oakland initially recovered the ball, but, citing the [...] "tuck rule," [...] which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting <b>to</b> <b>tuck</b> it back toward his body, referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay, ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble.|$|E

When he was himself double-crossed and captured and handed to an earlier Evelyn Necker to be dissected, he sent a failsafe signal <b>to</b> <b>Tuck</b> to hire the earlier Death's Head—this one human-sized, rather than the Transformer-sized version in contemporary settings - and come to his rescue. ("Hrm. That's me? Bio-organic? Droopy horns? No cape?! You're right -- I really do need saving!") After a brief fight, the two of them tore through an army of Death's Head 3.0's but were defeated and the original Death's Head was captured [...] to be used to create a portal to Hell. Both Death's Heads and Tuck fought against Mephisto's armies, gunning down the demonic Killpower. Afterwards, they departed to discuss the future.|$|E
2500|$|In the AFC, the Patriots {{defeated}} the Oakland Raiders 16–13 {{in the final}} game at Foxboro Stadium played in a driving New England snowstorm. The signature moment of the game was a controversial ruling by referee Walt Coleman {{in the fourth quarter}} that would cause this game to commonly be known as the [...] "tuck rule game." [...] While the Patriots possessed the ball, trailing the Raiders 13–10 with under two minutes left in regulation and no time outs, Brady was sacked by defensive back Charles Woodson, and appeared to fumble the ball. The fumble was recovered by Raiders linebacker Greg Biekert, presumably ending the game with a Raiders victory. After reviewing the play using instant replay, Coleman reversed the call on the field pursuant to the [...] "tuck rule", where a loose ball is ruled an incomplete pass if lost while [...] "tucking" [...] the ball. Most of the controversy centered on whether Brady was still trying <b>to</b> <b>tuck</b> the ball away when he lost control. Brady then led his team to the Raiders 27-yard line, where kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 45-yard field goal which barely cleared the crossbar to send the game into overtime. The Patriots won the toss in overtime and would win on another Vinatieri field goal from 23 yards. Oakland's offense never regained possession.|$|E

Dawson saves the young man, but is killed when Crazy Ted shoots him in the head. At the same time, Amanda's son has been in an accident and needs a heart transplant.
