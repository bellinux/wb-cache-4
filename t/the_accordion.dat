5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes {{and another}} {{observer}} {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. <b>The</b> <b>accordion</b> was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|Researcher Ronald Pearsall in {{his book}} The Table-Rappers (1972) {{suggested}} that a loop of catgut was attached to <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> so Home could turn it round.

25|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{instruments}} that are called <b>accordion.</b> <b>The</b> different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format.

Another type of <b>accordion</b> is <b>the</b> button <b>accordion,</b> which is used in several musical traditions, including Cajun, Conjunto and Tejano music, Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, Argentinian tango music and many other folk genres.|$|R
5|$|The {{claim that}} <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> feat was {{performed}} by Home using a small harmonica was originally suggested by J. M. Robertson in 1891. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR did not record {{the presence of the}} mouth organs, and Lamont speculates that it is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or not made them public. <b>The</b> <b>accordion</b> in the SPR collection is not the actual one Home used. They display a duplicate.|$|E
5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> experiment with Crookes, Home had performed <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E
5|$|The psychical {{researcher}} Hereward Carrington and spiritualist Herbert Thurston {{have claimed}} <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> experiment {{was not the}} result of deliberate fraud.

5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until the experiment is repeated, however, he suggested that <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} have suspected that a secret accomplice was involved. The magician Carlos Mar√≠a de Heredia {{claimed to have}} replicated <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> feat of Home and suggested it was a trick performed by an accomplice playing a hidden accordion. Ruth Brandon considered {{the possibility of an}} accomplice playing a concertina, or Home playing a hidden music box. However, Brandon dismissed the accomplice hypothesis as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Skeptic James Randi {{stated that}} Home was caught {{cheating}} {{on a few}} occasions, but the episodes were never made public, and that <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> feat was a one-octave mouth organ that Home concealed under his large moustache. Randi writes that one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death. According to Randi 'around 1960' William Lindsay Gresham told Randi he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research.|$|E

40|$|Algae are a {{prolific}} source of biochemicals with economic importance, including nutraceuticals, biofuels, animal feed, etc. The general {{aim of this}} study was to establish how the hydrodynamic conditions generated within specific types or designs of photobioreactors determine their respective algae growth. The specific objectives of this study were: (1) To determine and compare key hydrodynamic parameters in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> photobioreactor and <b>the</b> conventional bubble column, including Residence Time, Vessel Dispersion Number, Bodenstein Number, Mixing Time and oxygen liquid mass transfer coefficient (kla); and, (2) To test how differences in the hydrodynamic conditions would result in significant difference in growths of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquuus between the photobioreactors. The results of the study showed that: (1) The Residence Time of 566 s for <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> significantly exceeded by 28 % that of 444 s for the bubble column, signifying greater liquid mixing in the Air Accordion; (2) The Vessel Dispersion Number for <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> of 0. 168 significantly exceeded that for the bubble column of 0. 166, indicating greater degree of mixing in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> than in <b>the</b> bubble column; (3) The Mixing Time in both <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> and <b>the</b> bubble column declined as the air flow rate increased, indicating that the tracer ions in both photobioreactors mixed more quickly. For each of the flow rates tested, however, the mixing time for the bubble column significantly exceeded that for <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion,</b> indicating that liquid mixing in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> occured significantly quicker than in the bubble column. At 1. 0 LPM, the bubble column's Mixing Time of 10 s exceeded by 25 % that of <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> of 8 s; (4) The oxygen liquid mass transfer coefficients in both photobioreactors increased as the air flow rate increased, indicating that the transfer of oxygen from the air bubbles into the liquid within the photobioreactors gained efficiency. For each of the air flow rates tested, however, the oxygen liquid mass transfer coefficient for <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> significantly exceeded that for the bubble column, indicating a significantly more efficient oxygenation of the liquid in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> occurring than in the bubble column. At 1. 0 LPM, the Air Accordion's oxygen liquid mass transfer coefficient of 0. 00138 s‚Åª¬π exceeded by 48 % that of the bubble column of 0. 000931 s‚Åª¬π; and (5) The growth of Scenedesmus obliquus in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> significantly exceeded that in the bubble column for both 0. 1 LPM and 1. 0 LPM. The final algae density of 0. 25 g DW/L in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> significantly exceeded by 31 % that of 0. 18 g DW/L in the bubble column at 0. 1 LPM. Similarly, the final algae density of 0. 37 g DW/L in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> significantly exceeded by 19 % that of 0. 31 g DW/L in the bubble column at 1. 0 LPM. Thus, the growth of Scenedesmus obliquus in <b>the</b> Air <b>Accordion</b> photobioreactor [...] with significanlty more favorable hydrodynamic characteristics in terms of Residence Time, Vessel Dispersion Number, Mixing Time and oxygen liquid mass transfer coefficient [...] significantly exceeded algae growth in the bubble column of the same volume and under the same environmetal conditons...|$|R
5|$|Spain and {{subsequently}} Mexico controlled {{much of what}} is now the western United States until the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, including the entire state of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on <b>the</b> <b>accordion.</b> Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture.|$|E
5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E

5|$|The two-octave {{diatonic}} accordion (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for the performance of electrified salegy music. This accordion style was also integrated into the performance of tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of <b>the</b> <b>accordion</b> is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. R√©gis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.|$|E
