5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>that</b> the {{government}} would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for Medicare were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes {{that would result in}} rationing.|$|E

25|$|Anthropologists {{are divided}} into two schools {{on the origins of}} kissing, one believing that it is instinctual and {{intuitive}} and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>that</b> it evolved from what is known as kiss feeding, a process used by mothers to feed their infants by passing chewed food to their babies' mouths. Cesare Lombroso, Italian criminologist, physician and founder of the Italian School of Positivist Criminology, supported this idea.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is accomplished by}} the transfer of a spermatophore from the male to the female; scorpions possess a complex courtship and mating ritual to effect this transfer.

As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus.

25|$|The Late Middle Ages saw {{the clash}} between the Dominican and Franciscan schools of thought, which was also a {{conflict}} between two different mystical theologies: {{on the one hand}} that of Dominic de Guzmán and on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>that</b> of Francis of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, Bonaventure, and Angela of Foligno.

25|$|In 728, Leo sent to Italy a new exarch, Eutychius, {{to try to}} {{retrieve}} the situation. Eutychius sent an emissary to Rome, with instructions to kill Gregory and the chief nobility in the city, but the plot was uncovered and foiled. Next, he attempted to turn the Lombard king and dukes against the pope, but they retained their ambivalent stance, not committing one way or <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>That</b> same year Gregory wrote to Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople, giving the patriarch his support, and when Germanus abdicated, Gregory refused to acknowledge the new patriarch, Anastasius, nor the iconoclast rulings of a council summoned by Leo.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} shared {{parenting}} {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, {{and that it is}} the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>that</b> results in increased parental conflict. He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support {{is at the same time}} an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.|$|E
