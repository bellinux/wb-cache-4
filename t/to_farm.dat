40|$|This {{research}} was objected to describe farmer's response <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> credit (KUT), <b>to</b> determine <b>farming</b> productivity level, and to analyze correlation between farmer's response <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> credit (KUT) with farming productivity level and productivity level with Farming Income. The result shows that total farmers response <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> credit (KUT) are 58, 33 percent belongs to high criteria and 41, 67 percent belongs <b>to</b> medium criteria. <b>Farming</b> productivity of farmers are between 3. 700 kg until 5. 600 kg per hectare per planting season with average productivity 4. 633 kg per hectare per planting season. Analyzed with Spearman Correlation Rangking Test {{showed that there}} ia a positive correlation (rs = 0, 96) between farmers response <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> credit (KUT) with farming productivity. That means the farmer who have more higher response <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> credit (KUT) they have more higher farming productivity that can be achieved.

5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval potsherds {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease <b>to</b> <b>farm</b> the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had <b>to</b> <b>farm</b> the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92.

5|$|As {{the college}} {{prepared}} for independence in 1953, Madgwick {{and his staff}} discussed establishing a farm-related degree program distinctive from the veterinary science degree offered at the University of Sydney. Madgwick journeyed to England and the United States to consult with agriculturalists, veterinarians, and specialists in animal husbandry. While Madgwick was gone, his deputy warden, James Belshaw, read a letter in the Australian Veterinary Journal from Gordon McClymont, a researcher in animal nutrition for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which advocated {{the establishment of a}} multi-disciplinary approach <b>to</b> <b>farm</b> science combining animal husbandry and agronomy.|$|E

5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued <b>to</b> <b>farm.</b> During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 to get as far as possible from the Spanish influence.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the widespread migration <b>to</b> <b>farms</b> in the U. S. during the Great Depression. We {{show that the}} option <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>farms</b> serves as informal insurance during times of economic crisis, and that modernization in the agricultural sector reduces {{the ability of the}} land to provide this insurance function. The movement <b>to</b> <b>farms</b> also has spillovers on the broader economy, facilitating a decline in market-based expenditure and a shift into home production. At the same time, by absorbing surplus labor, the subsistence farm sector puts upward pressure on nonfarm wages and thus provides a countervailing force against deflation. We also provide evidence that the introduction of formal unemployment compensation reduces the movement <b>to</b> <b>farms</b> later in the decade. Our results bring attention to a less-studied effect by which formal insurance stabilizes the economy during deep crises: it increases market demand by diverting consumption away from home production and towards market-based expenditure...|$|R
