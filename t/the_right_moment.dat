5|$|On 23 May 1948, the Indian Army {{captured}} Tithwal from Pakistani troops, but the Pakistanis quickly {{launched a}} counter-attack {{to recapture the}} area. The Indian troops, unable to withstand the attack, withdrew from their positions to the Tithwal ridge, preparing to regain their positions at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann {{jumped out of}} the back of the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E
25|$|At <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> the attacking rook {{abandons}} the pawn {{and joins}} {{in the attack}} on the kingside pawns.|$|E
50|$|Sailing {{vessels are}} {{designed}} to operate with {{a higher degree of}} heel than motorized vessels and <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> at extreme angles is of high importance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weight of}} the entire boat is 1180 kilograms, {{including}} the hull and standing rigging. The design concentrates <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> of <b>the</b> keel in a 770 kilogram torpedo-shaped bulb {{at the end of}} an airfoil shaped fin. The ballast to displacement ratio is 0.61 which provides an exceptionally [...] "stiff" [...] platform. <b>The</b> high <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> allows <b>the</b> design to carry a larger than normal sail area which increases power and consequently speed through the water.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Roberson {{writes on}} NYTheatre.com on March 19, 2010, [...] "Ryan Knowles is perfect. Made up as a Jagger-Hedwig hybrid, Knowles moves between his songs and speeches with ease, hitting all <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments.</b> We are enthalled..with him, and always interested." ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1928 U.S. presidential campaign, he {{supported}} Al Smith, the Democratic Governor of New York, {{who would go}} on to lose to Republican Herbert Hoover. Byrd himself was an early favorite for the 1932 presidential nomination but he opted to endorse Franklin D. Roosevelt at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> and became an official in Roosevelt's successful campaign.|$|E
25|$|Ram taeng Kae This {{is another}} {{elaborate}} Nora dance that requires great interpretative gifts. On the stage the protagonist launches a harpoon at the crocodile, whose back, lit by candles, {{is made from}} {{the trunk of a}} banyan tree. The female dancer moves around the writhing crocodile, poised to pierce its head at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Noten {{commented on}} Cartier's iconic Love Bracelet, {{that can only}} be {{unlocked}} by the partner, by producing The Real Love Bracelet, a silver bracelet attached to a blown glass bubble with a pair of rings inside. That way the wearer always has a pair of rings handy and only needs to break the bubble when <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> has arrived.|$|E
50|$|Filming {{critical}} {{moments in}} the life of a herd of elephants necessitated the expertise of Cynthia Moss, who had devoted 25 years to researching the animals in Kenya. She was able to advise the production team on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments</b> to film specific events.|$|R
5000|$|Where RM is <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment,</b> GZ is <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> arm and [...] is the {{displacement}}. Because {{the vessel}} displacement is constant, common practice {{is to simply}} graph <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> arm vs <b>the</b> angle of heel. <b>The</b> <b>righting</b> arm (known also as GZ — see diagram): the horizontal distance between the lines of buoyancy and gravity.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a test of}} Patrick's musical recall, House wheels a piano {{into his}} room and plays the opening bars of [...] "I Don't Like Mondays" [...] by the Boomtown Rats. Patrick plays them back note for note as House adds the hand-claps at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
25|$|Zizka, {{throughout}} the rest of December, launched numerous counter-offensives and raids on the Germans' lines. He also introduced the use of small firearms for large bodies of infantry, eventually equipping a third of his infantry. His normal tactic was to mount raids that would draw his opponent into attacking his wagon fort, then, at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> sortie out of the fort with his cavalry, bowmen, and pikemen to ravage the enemy forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circadian {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick of the wrist.|$|E
5000|$|The {{metacentric}} height is an approximation for the vessel stability {{at a small}} angle (0-15 degrees) of heel. Beyond that range, {{the stability of the}} vessel is dominated by what is known as a <b>righting</b> <b>moment.</b> Depending on <b>the</b> geometry of the hull, Naval Architects must iteratively calculate the center of buoyancy at increasing angles of heel. They then calculate <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> at this angle, which is determined using the equation: ...|$|R
500|$|His {{realistic}} approach, designing dances {{that were}} inspired by the way ordinary people behaved, led one critic to observe that [...] "Kidd is, in a way, the originator of the fantasy that if only your life shaped up and offered you <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments,</b> you too {{would be able to}} dance like a Hollywood star".|$|R
50|$|The Buzz {{is similar}} to the ISO racing dinghy, it is scaled down version of the larger boat, being 10 kg lighter and with a smaller sail area of 12.85m², {{compared}} to the ISO's 14.74m². However, unlike the ISO the Buzz does not have the option of wings to assist <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> for shorter or lighter crews.|$|R
25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans {{as the best}} {{people in the world}} not only because of their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in these issues and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E
25|$|In an Engine Management System (EMS), {{electronics}} control {{fuel delivery}} and ignition timing. Primary sensors {{on the system}} are crankshaft angle (crankshaft or Top Dead Center (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to burn it. Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with}} the changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E
25|$|Selena {{was sure}} {{her father would}} leave them alone if they were married, {{and they could be}} {{together}} openly. They planned to keep the elopement a secret until she found <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to reveal her marriage, but the media announced their elopement over the radio within hours of the marriage ceremony. Selena's family tried to track her down. Abraham did not take the news well, and alienated himself for a time. Selena and Pérez moved into an apartment in Corpus Christi. until Abraham approached them, apologized, accepted the marriage and Chris back into the band.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the second}} album, Jim Burn on folkalley.com wrote, “Harvey {{has once again}} sparked {{conversation}} with these arrangements, but pulls them off with such class that any suggestion of novelty instantly disappears once you listen. He adds vocal harmony (The Settles Connection) and strings at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments,</b> but mostly lets his cast of stars deliver.” ...|$|R
50|$|Initial guesses of {{parameters}} including boat speed (Vs), {{heel angle}} (Φ), number of reefs and sail flatness are {{input into the}} boat model. Using these input parameters the solution algorithm calculates the different between the propulsive force of the sails and the resistive force of the hull. It also calculates <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> created by <b>the</b> hull and the operational heel angle.|$|R
50|$|The B&R 23 {{sports a}} 5 ft {{rotating}} bowsprit {{which allows the}} Asymmetrical spinnaker being rotated laterally 30 degrees to windward, to avoid blanketing behind the jib when sailing deeper angles. It also features a system with two trapezes to maximize <b>the</b> <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> that <b>the</b> crew can assert on the boat to keep it level. The retractable keel is operated with a tackle attached to the mast.|$|R
25|$|While Coligny was {{engaging}} the enemy infantry, Bouillon, who kept his cavalry {{hidden behind the}} heights, was awaiting for a signal from his squire Domerville, whom he had left in a hill nearby, to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to charge against the French Royal forces. Half an hour {{from the beginning of}} the battle, Domerville made the signal, and then Bouillon charged upon Coligny's right flank. The French cavalry was thrown in disarray over the French infantry, which was broken and driven from the field in disorder. The malcontents and the Habsburg forces took 4,000 prisoners, including 400 officers, all the artillery and the baggage of Coligny's Royal army, many flags and a cash of 400,000 livres.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers {{have said that}} even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b> In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 316 BC, Seleucus and Peithon joined Antigonus, who was {{following}} Eumenes to Susa. From Susa Antigonus went to Media, from where he could threaten the eastern provinces. He left Seleucus with {{a small number of}} troops to prevent Eumenes from reaching the Mediterranean. Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, saw the situation as hopeless and returned to his own province. The armies of Eumenes and his allies were at breaking point. Antigonus and Eumenes had two encounters during 316 BC, in the battles of Paraitacene and Gabiene. Eumenes was defeated and executed. The events of the Second War of the Diadochi revealed Seleucus' ability to wait for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b> Blazing into battle was not his style.|$|E
50|$|Birmingham wasted a two-goal lead at Ewood Park against Blackburn Rovers. Matt Jansen {{gave the}} hosts an early lead with an incisive finish but Anderton {{equalised}} 12 minutes later. Robbie Savage put Birmingham ahead on 38 minutes after Melchiot's marauding run down <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Moments</b> before half-time Dunn netted against his old side to give Birmingham a commanding 3-1 lead at the interval. But Steven Reid and Paul Gallagher's {{goals in the}} second period rescued Rovers an unlikely point.|$|R
50|$|The {{handsome}} school president. He assists the Twin Angels as a Tuxedo Mask-inspired hero. His main {{weapons are}} blue roses he apparently cuts from folded paper. Haruka has {{a crush on}} him. He often acts as a Deus Ex Machina either working off-screen to happily resolve a conflict or rendering assistance at exactly <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments.</b> He is apparently from a rich family yet {{much of his time}} is spent doing odd and occasionally humiliating part-time jobs.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, Bud Scoppa {{wrote in}} Rolling Stone {{in his review}} of the Eagles' debut album that [...] "Take it Easy" [...] was [...] "simply the best {{sounding}} rock single to come out so far this year. The first time through, you could tell it had everything: danceable rhythm, catchy, winding melody, intelligent, affirmative lyrics, a progressively powerful arrangement mixing electric guitar and banjo, and a crisp vocal, with vibrant four-part harmony at just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments</b> for maximum dramatic effect." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{music was}} {{performed}} by a choir of 430, a 65 piece orchestra and 10 State Trumpeters. At the 1838 coronation, the organist had attempted to play the instrument and conduct at the same time, {{with the result that}} neither function was satisfactory. Bridge not only delegated the organ to Walter Alcock, but also used two sub-conductors, and furthermore alternated with Parratt in conducting {{from the top of the}} organ screen. The only real musical error was that Bridge misjudged the timing of I Was Glad and had finished the anthem before the King had arrived, having to repeat it when <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> came. Bridge was saved by the organist, who improvised in the interim.|$|E
25|$|Kali {{traveled}} to Nala’s kingdom of Nishadhas and waited twelve long years for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to strike. Because Nala had rendered himself impure by not washing his feet before his prayers, Kali {{was able to}} bewitch his soul. Kali then appeared before Pushkara and invited him {{to play a game}} of dice with his brother, guaranteeing Nala’s downfall. Dwapara took the form of the Vrisha die that would be used in the fixed game. Kali forced Nala to lose and, each time, he would raise the stakes higher despite the protest of his advisors and wife. Finally, Nala lost his kingdom to Pushkara. Both he and Damayanti were exiled to the forest.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of June 23, 1941, the rebels raided a Soviet armory in Šančiai, Panemunė, and Vilijampolė. Now armed, Lithuanians spread {{throughout}} the city. The Vilijampolė Bridge across the Neris River received special attention from the rebels as they expected the Germans to enter the city using this bridge. When the Lithuanians got to the bridge, it was already wired with explosives. 40 Soviet troops and three armored vehicles protected the bridge and waited for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to detonate. When the Soviets retreated a bit after facing Lithuanian fire, Juozas Savulionis ran {{to the middle of}} the bridge, cut the wires, and thus saved it from destruction. On his way back Savulionis was shot and killed by Soviet fire, becoming one of the first victims of the uprising.|$|E
