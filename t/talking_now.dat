25|$|In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in Look Who's Talking, which grossed $297,000,000, {{making it}} his most {{successful}} film since Grease. Travolta continued {{to the two}} sequels Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and Look Who's <b>Talking</b> <b>Now</b> (1993). But {{it was not until}} he played Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino's hit Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career revived. The movie shifted him back onto the A-list, and he was inundated with offers. Notable roles following Pulp Fiction include a movie-buff loan shark in Get Shorty (1995), an FBI agent and terrorist in Face/Off (1997), a desperate attorney in A Civil Action (1998), a Bill Clinton-esque presidential candidate in Primary Colors (1998), and a military investigator in The General's Daughter (1999).|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and after}} the {{production}} of Cheers had ended, the cast [...] had {{moved on to other}} stages in their careers. Shelley Long appeared on the CBS show Good Advice before this episode, and resumed her work there. Ted Danson appeared in Made in America, which opened in theatres soon after the episode aired. Kirstie Alley participated in the film Look Who's <b>Talking</b> <b>Now.</b>|$|E
50|$|Motion {{felt that}} Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> {{would have a}} chance at winning an Eclipse Award if he won another Grade I race, {{especially}} as he had beaten the eventual champion turf horse Kitten's Joy head-to-head. Accordingly, he entered Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> in the Hollywood Turf Cup on December 4. However, the pace was slow and Dominguez had trouble settling the horse. On the final turn, Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> became rank and pulled his way to the lead while racing extremely wide, then tired in the stretch to finish sixth.|$|R

2500|$|In her June 2013 {{address to}} the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, Palin {{declared}} her opposition to American involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war: [...] "Militarily, where is our Commander-in-Chief? We’re <b>talking</b> <b>now</b> more new interventions. I say, until we know what we’re doing, {{until we have a}} Commander-in-Chief who knows what he’s doing, well, Chief, in these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, ‘Allah Akbar,’ I say, until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say, let Allah sort it out!" [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] is usually translated [...] "God is Great" [...] and used in various contexts by Muslims; [...] "Allah" [...] is the Arabic word for God.|$|E
2500|$|The British Army also {{continued}} firing CS gas. Local politicians and priests {{who were on}} the streets [...] "complained that every time they got a bad situation cooled down more gas had been plunged in". Slingshots were used to launch heavy CS gas canisters into the area and some went through the roofs of houses. According to the Central Citizens' Defence Committee, even streets where there had been no disorder [...] "received salvo after salvo". The soldiers fired 1,600 canisters and cartridges of CS gas during the operation, which was considered to be excessive in such a small area. Some householders set buckets filled with a mixture of water and vinegar outside their front doors [...] "so that those involved in clashes could wet rags to protect them against the stinging gas". Journalist Peter Taylor described the effect of the CS gas on the densely populated area:The clouds of choking and suffocating gas drifted up the narrow alleyways and back streets of the warren that is the Lower Falls. The gas got everywhere, in through windows, under doors and into the residents' eyes, noses, throats and lungs. A soldier later interviewed by Taylor recalled: [...] "The place was still saturated with CS gas. Children were coughing, I remember. I'm <b>talking</b> <b>now</b> about the toddlers, kids of three, four, five. It affected everyone but children especially". There were allegations that some soldiers fired CS gas canisters through the windows of houses while residents were still inside. Hundreds of women and children, along with the sick and elderly, began to leave the area.|$|E

5000|$|Over a {{yielding}} turf course, Star Over the Bay went to {{the early}} lead with Kitten's Joy tracking in third and Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> near {{the back of the}} pack. With a half mile remaining, Powerscourt made his move while Star Over the Bay started to tire, eventually finishing last. Looking for racing room {{at the top of the}} stretch, Kitten's Joy swung out just as Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> was starting his run on the outside of the field. Kitten's Joy checked sharply due to a lack of racing room and his jockey later claimed foul, saying contact between the two horses caused Kitten's Joy to lose momentum. Regardless, Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> continued with a powerful run down the stretch, then started to drift in, brushing with Powerscourt as he moved to the lead. Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> won by [...] lengths over a late-finishing Kitten's Joy, with Powerscourt in third.|$|R

5000|$|After a fourth-place {{finish in}} the Dixie Stakes, Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> next raced in the Grade I United Nations Stakes on July 2. Motion also entered Shake the Bank as a [...] "rabbit" [...] to ensure a fast pace. Shake the Bank led until mid-stretch when he was caught by Silverfoot. Meanwhile, Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> was trapped behind a wall of horses until a gap opened up on the rail. Better <b>Talk</b> <b>Now</b> {{accelerated}} through and pulled away to win by three-quarters of a length over Silverfoot. [...] "I was thrilled that it really worked out," [...] said Motion. [...] "I got a little nervous at the quarter-pole {{when it looked like}} the rabbit would keep going. But our plan couldn't have worked out any better. Ramon rode a great race." ...|$|R
