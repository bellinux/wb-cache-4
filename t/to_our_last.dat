500|$|Following Britain's {{declaration}} of war on Germany on 4 August 1914, Australia {{and the other members}} of the British Empire became automatically involved, with Prime Minister Joseph Cook stating on 5 August 1914 that [...] "...when the Empire is at war, so also is Australia." [...] Given the predominantly British heritage of most Australians at the time, there was considerable support from all corners of the country and large numbers of young Australian men reported to recruiting centres around the country to enlist in the following months. When Prime Minister Andrew Fisher's Labor Party came to power in September 1914, he reiterated Cook's statement saying, [...] "Should the worst happen...", Australia would [...] "...rally to the Mother Country... to help and defend her <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> man and our last shilling." ...|$|E

[...] Rowling also praised the National Health Service (NHS).|$|E
2500|$|Opposing O'Brien's {{proposals}} and initiatives, the Redmond-Dillon-Devlin (IPP-UIL-AOH) hardline alliance remained uncompromising with their standpoint – [...] "no concessions for Ulster". In the Commons on 25 May O'Brien stated that [...] "we {{are ready for}} almost any conceivable concession to Ulster that will {{have the effect of}} uniting Ireland, but we will struggle <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> breath against a proposal which will divide her, and divide her eternally, if Ireland's own representatives are once consenting parties [...] [...] [...]" [...] after which he and his followers holding true to their pledge, abstained from the final vote passing the Home Rule Act 1914, denouncing the bill as a [...] "ghastly farce" [...] ultimately as a [...] "partition deal" [...] after Sir Edward Carson leader of the Ulster Unionist Party forced through an amendment mandating the partition of Ireland, the Irish Nationalists' confrontation course with Ulster ending in fiasco.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Wanton held any important office in the colony prior to his election as governor in May 1769. [...] Once elected, his first act was to send a letter to Lord Hillsborough, the Colonial Secretary of State, with whom his predecessor, Josias Lyndon, had corresponded. [...] In the letter he boldly stated that it was not possible for him as governor to obey the instructions of the crown [...] "without acting diametrically opposite to the constitution of the colony...; we cannot but humbly express our opinion that the power exercised by the Parliament of Great Britain (in which we are not represented), of raising monies upon us without our consent (which it is possible under a bad administration, may be extended <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> penny), is a real grievance; we are not without hopes that his Majesty's rejecting our petition, is entirely owing to the false information he hath received from America, of the state and temper of his subjects here." ...|$|E

60|$|That {{morning we}} again {{attended}} in the Throne Hall, and I {{could not help}} smiling to myself when I compared the visit <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last,</b> and reflecting that, if walls could speak, they would have strange tales to tell.|$|E
40|$|This is a note showing that, {{contrary}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>lasting</b> belief, the nonadditivity X(1 + 2) =X(1) +X(2) +α X(1) X(2) {{is not a}} true physical property. α in this expression {{cannot be}} unique for a given system. It unavoidably depends on how one mathematically divides the system and cannot be used to characterize nonadditivity. As a matter of fact, its use is mathematically inconsistent...|$|R

6000|$|... (III.) Thus far, then, of the nature, {{thus far}} of the teaching, of woman, and thus of her {{household}} office, and queenliness. We now come <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last,</b> our widest question.--What is her queenly office {{with respect to}} the state? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, {{looking at}} a spot where his finger rested, [...] "my mother was Margaret Beaton; she {{died when she was}} forty-seven,--hers wasn't a {{long-lived}} family; we're our mother's children, Gritty and me are,--we shall go <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> bed before long." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Men do that," [...] Becky {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "Women {{are not so}} bad as you. Last year, when we {{were reduced}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> guinea, she gave us everything.

60|$|It was a {{cover for}} his book-table that I {{happened}} to be ornamenting. It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never resumed.
