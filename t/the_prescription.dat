5|$|President Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female {{contraception}} {{was added to}} a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover <b>the</b> <b>prescription</b> contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.|$|E
5|$|Belle and Aden grow close again, {{and begin}} seeing {{one another in}} secret, as Belle is still dating Angelo. Aden's {{relationship}} with her deteriorates when Belle develops post-traumatic stress disorder after being attacked. She later refuses to leave hospital after being injured in a fire, and becomes addicted to <b>the</b> <b>prescription</b> medication that she takes for anxiety. Aden's feelings for Nicole are reignited, and they have sex several times before being caught together by Belle. Roman throws Aden out for sleeping with his daughter. Drug addict Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) deepens the rift between Aden and Belle, but they eventually reconcile and become engaged. In order {{to pay for a}} wedding ring, Aden takes a loan from corrupt bookmaker Clint, and loses several football matches on Clint's instruction. He refuses to ruin Geoff's career by injuring him, however, so Clint has Aden beaten up. Belle learns that she has terminal cancer and pushes the wedding forward, but does not tell Aden. He is devastated to learn of her condition the day before the ceremony, but is convinced {{to go ahead with the}} wedding by Roman. He and Belle spend four weeks together as husband and wife before she dies. Following her death, Aden becomes reclusive. He eventually returns to work, and is saved by Geoff when he almost drowns in an accident, which results in them becoming friends.|$|E

40|$|Drug {{interaction}} {{represents a}} major problem in day- to- day practice. The incidence of adverse reactions increases almost exponentially as the number of drugs co prescribed rises, and this is in part due to interaction. Critically ill, chronically ill and elderly patients are particularly at risk of drug interactions due to polypharmacy as well as impaired homeostatic mechanisms. The study was aimed to assess polypharmacy and drug interaction in <b>the</b> <b>prescriptions.</b> <b>The</b> study was carried out by taking 200 prescriptions from different departments of our hospital and assessed the drug interaction through Micromedex and Drugs update. Polypharmacy was assessed using Prescribing indicators in WHO drug use indicators. Polypharmacy was observed in 85 % of <b>the</b> <b>prescriptions</b> and drug interaction was observed in 58. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>prescriptions.</b> INTRODUCTION: Drug interactions and side effects are the negative but real consequences of pharmacological therapy.

25|$|There is a {{small group}} of List II drugs for which doctors have to write the {{prescriptions}} according to the same, tougher guidelines as those for List I drugs (writing <b>the</b> <b>prescription</b> in full in letters, listing the patients name, and have to contain the name and initials, address, city and telephone number of the licensed prescriber issuing the prescriptions, as well as the name and initials, address and city of the person <b>the</b> <b>prescription</b> is issued to).

40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} impact of {{introducing}} an electronic prescription system with no copayments on <b>the</b> number of <b>prescriptions,</b> <b>the</b> size of <b>prescriptions,</b> and <b>the</b> number of visits and phone calls to primary physicians. Methods: Fixed regression models using monthly data on per capita prescriptions claims and consultations between 2009 and 2013 at the municipality level, before and after the introduction of <b>the</b> electronic <b>prescription</b> system. Results: <b>The</b> electronic <b>prescription</b> system with no copayment increased <b>the</b> number of <b>prescriptions</b> by between 6. 0 and 8. 1 %. It decreased the average size of each prescription, but it did not decrease the number of consultations. Conclusion: The reduced direct and indirect costs of obtaining <b>prescriptions</b> after <b>the</b> introduction of <b>the</b> electronic <b>prescription</b> system changed <b>the</b> financial incentives facing the patients and physicians. This led to significant changes in the level and size of <b>prescriptions</b> and illustrates <b>the</b> importance of financial incentives...|$|R
