5|$|Given Hasbro's {{framework}} for Littlest Pet Shop, the developers Cahills pitched their {{adaptation of the}} property. Hasbro originally felt discouraged over having the show set at the pet store, finding the exchange of animals they thought would come from that disconcerting. The Cahills saw the studio's definition of such stores as antiquated, convincing them that most modern locations provide grooming and day care services as opposed <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> selling pets. Production followed quickly, much to their surprise.|$|E
5|$|Mubarak {{initially}} gave concessions, {{including the}} dissolution of parliament, agreeing to oversee a process of reform, and promising not to run for reelection in September2011. The protesters, however, were not satisfied and by February8 there were widespread calls for Mubarak's resignation. On the night of 10February, Mubarak gave a speech {{in which it was}} expected he would step down. Anger erupted when he stated plans <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> delegate some of his power. By the next day, 11 February 2011, he had resigned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{bank of the}} Markham River lay Markham Point, where the Japanese {{maintained}} a force of about 200 men on commanding ground. Part of the 24th Infantry Battalion was ordered to capture the position. The attack {{on the morning of}} 4 September went wrong from the start, with two scouts being wounded by a land mine. The force fought its way into the Japanese position but took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw. Twelve Australians were killed and six were wounded in the attack. It was then decided <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> contain the Japanese force at Markham Point, which was subjected to mortar fire and an airstrike.|$|E

Ashikaga Yoshihisa was enraged by the rebellion and ordered Rennyo to excommunicate his followers in Kaga. However, Hosokawa Katsumoto, a personal friend and ally of Rennyo, brokered a deal which allowed Rennyo <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> reprimand the Kaga ikki.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of standard gauge, Flekkefjord went from being an important hub for transport along the south coast, <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> being a branch station. However, the number of daily trains to Sira and Moi had increased to twelve, operated with Class 86 and Class 87 multiple units. The Class 87 was used until 1956, when Class 86 came into service. In 1966, Class 87 was reintroduced. Important cargo customers {{at the time were}} Draco (who made boats) and Halvorsens Kjelfabrikk (who made boilers). From 1981, the Class 89 came into use, remaining until the station was closed in 1990.|$|E

A full-size tapestry copy of Pablo Picasso's Guernica, by , {{on the wall of the}} United Nations building at the entrance to the Security Council room. In 1952, two Léger murals were installed in the General Assembly Hall. The works are meant <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> be decorative with no symbolism.

5|$|The {{border between}} the Reich and Yugoslavia was {{unsuitable}} for motorised operations. Due to the short notice of the invasion, {{the elements of the}} invading German 2nd Army that would make up LI Infantry Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps had to be transported from Germany, German-occupied France and the Nazi puppet Slovak Republic, and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas. In the interim, the Germans formed a special force under the code name Feuerzauber (Magic Fire). This force was initially intended <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> reinforce the 538th Frontier Guard Division, who were manning the border. On the evening of 5 April, one of the aggressive Feuerzauber detachment commanders, Hauptmann Palten, led his Kampfgruppe Palten across the Mura from Spielfeld and, having secured the bridge, began attacking bunkers and other Yugoslav positions on the high ground, and sent patrols deep into the Yugoslav border fortification system. Due to a lack of Yugoslav counter-attacks, many of these positions remained in German hands into 6 April.|$|E
5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands {{to know how to}} restore Mulder to his own body. Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call and set up a meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a game to include stealth gameplay, the {{knowledge}} of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world. The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies' reactions to the effects of the player's actions, such as turning off the lights, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI's movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries. Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player. Examples of hybrid stealth/horror games include , Outlast, and the Penumbra video game series.|$|E

5|$|The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited <b>to</b> <b>merely</b> transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
