5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work {{that had previously been}} done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E

25|$|On an {{ordinary}} day the police {{might not have}} taken his report seriously, but this time a strong force was sent to investigate, accompanied by a plain-clothes officer.

25|$|The {{case was}} one of 11 {{decisions}} of the High Court referred to by the Attorney-General, Billy Hughes, as cutting down the Commonwealth's powers until they were futile and justifying the changes proposed in the 1913 referendum.

25|$|There is no rule stating a team {{must play}} a wicket-keeper. On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast {{game between the}} Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. Their keeper, Ben Cox, became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled. The umpires {{consulted}} {{with each other and}} agreed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the rules to prevent it from happening.|$|E
25|$|In , four of {{the sixteen}} {{countries}} taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among {{most of the other}} participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.|$|E

25|$|Davis {{disagreed}} with the majority's view that Congress had consented to {{the transfer of the}} two counties when it debated the proposed West Virginia constitution. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the debates to ever suggest that, he wrote. What Congress agreed to was that the two counties should be offered the chance to join West Virginia {{by the time of the}} new state's admission to union with the United States. These conditions had not been met by the time of admission, and thus no transfer could be constitutionally made. Congress had not agreed to additional legislative acts of transfer, and thus they could not be made without Virginia's assent (which was now withdrawn).|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, Wintzingerode with 8,000 cavalry and 40 guns arrived near Vitry-le-François while Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov with Wintzingerode's {{infantry}} plus Langeron and Sacken {{were coming}} up behind. Yorck and Kleist reached Château-Thierry. After a captured French message indicated that Napoleon was at Saint-Dizier, the Allies decided to merge their two armies and go after Napoleon with 200,000 troops. With the French emperor already blocking their supply line to Germany, the Allies determined {{to establish a new}} line from the Netherlands to Laon. At Bar-sur-Aube, Emperor Francis I of Austria was warned to leave for Dijon. Francis fled to safety with the Austrian Army of the South a few hours ahead of the French cavalry. On the evening of 23 March, a message from Napoleon's Chief of Police Anne Jean Marie René Savary was intercepted by Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn's Cossacks. It stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the arsenals and treasury at Paris and that the city's increasingly restive population was demanding peace. More information arrived from Napoleon's enemies in Paris.|$|E
500|$|In 1886 the High Court of Justice in London {{ruled in}} the Parks case—Jenks v. Turpin—that baccarat {{was a game}} of chance rather than skill, and was {{therefore}} illegal when gambling was involved. In reporting the case, The Times described baccarat as [...] "a new game, partly of chance, at which £1,000 may be lost in 20 minutes". After a solicitor asked the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, to clarify the position regarding baccarat in social clubs and private houses, the Home Office civil servant Godfrey Lushington stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the court's judgment that made baccarat illegal if not played for money.|$|E

I'd get {{home from school and}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|The Observer (The Guardians sister paper) {{published}} {{an image of}} Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met Paul Lewis, a Guardian reporter who had worked on The Observer story. Tomlinson's wife said this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death. The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper {{to say he was}} [...] "extremely unhappy" [...] that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had to stay away from them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of [...] "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." [...] On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police. During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.|$|E
500|$|The SFPA {{deferred}} to the Magnuson–Stevens Act for its {{definition of a}} fishing vessel. According to that statute, a fishing vessel was one that either engaged in fishing, or [...] "aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea {{in the performance of}} any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing." [...] Moskowitz rejected NOAA's argument that the KD II was engaged in fishing and therefore a fishing vessel because, under its previous ownership, it had been equipped with longline equipment and held a federal permit. That had lapsed shortly after Tran and Yu bought the ship and was no longer valid, so neither was the argument based on paper. [...] "Whether the KD II is in fact a fishing vessel under [...] depends on its configuration and how it was outfitted {{at the time of the}} seizure," [...] he wrote. Since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the record about that, he declined to decide the question on that grounds.|$|E

500|$|Fleder {{also asked}} for stylistic {{touches on the}} episode which were {{inconsistent}} with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red scrim lighting {{to reflect on the}} subway car to add an artistic visual touch, even though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> particular in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying [...] "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." [...] Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning {{back and forth between the}} two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on Homicide: Life on the Street are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot through the windshield again.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Harlem, Sims began performing {{on the street}} {{as he had done}} in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: [...] "I knew people who danced on dinner plates... There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on." [...] He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the [...] "Amateur Night" [...] stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.When big name dancers played The Apollo, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the audience but dancers with their shoes," [...] said Sandman Sims. [...] "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the reason a guy would want to dance at The Apollo.By the mid-1950s, he had been hired as the Apollo's stage manager, and soon began his role as the Apollo's famed [...] "executioner", chasing Amateur Night contestants the crowd disapproved of off the stage with a shepherd's crook (known since vaudeville times as [...] "the hook") a broom, or other props, while dressed in a variety of wacky costumes, whether long underwear, a clown suit, or even a diaper. Backstage, however, he would console defeated contestants with the story of his having been booed off ten times before he finally got to finish his own act. Sims would play [...] "executioner" [...] until shortly after Time Warner took over the Apollo in 1999.|$|E
500|$|Following the members' poll, Yorkshire sent a {{telegram}} to Sutcliffe in South Africa, {{asking him to}} withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy. Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it. When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December, they appointed William Worsley, who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments. In the words of Wisden, [...] "Happily the trouble was eventually settled {{to the satisfaction of}} all concerned. Sutcliffe declined the honour and, an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley, that gentleman stepped into the breach." [...] Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for [...] "your loyalty to the club". The Yorkshire Post also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself, noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable, it was [...] "carried to unreasonable lengths". Commenting on the affair, The Times expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game, but that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> principle to prevent a professional from performing the role. Of Sutcliffe, it said, [...] "One would have liked to see him lead the side, and his general popularity, combined with his skill as a batsman, makes it probable that {{he would have been a}} success. However, half the value of a captain is gone if, before he takes up his duties, people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position, and Sutcliffe has been well-advised to recognise this fact." [...] The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose a skipper from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role; it added that Rhodes might have found it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders.|$|E
