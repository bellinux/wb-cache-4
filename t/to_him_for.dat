He has a habit of disobeying his master's strict rules, sometimes causing tension between them, but the Beast often turns <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> advice. He is depicted as flirtatious, as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle. A running gag throughout the movie is Lumière burning Cogsworth. Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumière.|$|E

5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA {{was ready to}} step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E

IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E

5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Beata {{reveals that}} {{they are aware of}} four male {{survivors}} of the Odin who have caused disruption in their society, and are considered fugitives. Beata requests Riker stay with her (and later requests that he order Troi, Data, and Yar to track down the survivors' camp and their leader Ramsey (Sam Hennings), while staying and dining with her). After some back and forth, Data concludes Ramsey and the survivors of the Odin would have platinum with them, and Angel One is naturally devoid of platinum, allowing the Enterprise to easily detect them. Meanwhile, Riker dresses in the garb given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his dinner with Beata, Troi and Yar taunt him for dressing in clothes that sexualize him and in some ways demean him, and he is only doing it to win favor with Beata. He responds by saying he is honoring the local customs, and acknowledges Beata's beauty, and that the garb is rather comfortable.|$|E

5|$|Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film {{directed}} and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. The film {{is based on}} the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so experienced that the FBI eventually turned <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> help in catching other checking forgers. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye in supporting roles.|$|E

He used the Citizen Genet affair to convince the Washington administration to make {{an agreement with the}} Spanish for free trade on the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{plagued by}} {{political}} missteps and personal scandals, {{the administration of}} Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable, and many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election. Prominent party figures– {{as well as the}} White House– wanted Romney to run for governor and the opportunity appealed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> reasons including its national visibility. A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50percentage points. On March 19, 2002, Swift announced she would not seek her party's nomination, and hours later Romney declared his candidacy, for which he would face no opposition in the primary. In June 2002, the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney's eligibility to run for governor, noting that state law required seven years' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000. In response, the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was, therefore, an eligible candidate.|$|E
5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily, which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed {{to catch up with}} the expedition before it sailed for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> help, but he did nothing.|$|E
