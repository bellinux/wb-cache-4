5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{only way to get}} back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard.

5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last time, but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E

Several planned stations in the New York City Subway may possibly feature platform screen doors, possibly including future stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway.

I-244/US-412 continue east, with exit ramps to local streets, as well as SH-11 and US-169. I-244 ends at I-44/SH-66; US-412 forms a concurrency with the latter two routes as they continue east into Rogers County.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E

However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last time she can help him.|$|E

5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient {{feature of the}} first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat {{in the style of}} variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
