At the same time, Mark also became involved in a police corruption storyline, after he reported Constable Wes Holland (Daniel Hamill), for taking bribes. McGregor told an Inside Soap writer, [...] "Mark's life has been turned upside down since he blew the whistle on Constable Holland", adding that he was now being treated like he did the wrong thing. When Mark went to Charlie's to escape his troubles at the police station, he met up with Jade. <b>They</b> <b>kissed</b> as Jade became [...] "the perfect distraction" [...] for him.

500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how <b>they</b> <b>kissed</b> each other and gazed at one another. Such a thing had never before been witnessed in this country, as one tribe was nearly always waging war against another." ...|$|E
500|$|Perennially [...] "unlucky in love", Donna {{fits the}} tart {{with a heart}} stereotype. Her {{numerous}} romances during her tenure earned her the nickname [...] "Nurse 'Action' Jackson". In 2004, she had a lesbian liaison with Mickie. The scene in which <b>they</b> <b>kissed</b> was edited to half its original length after being deemed too explicit for pre-watershed broadcast. Later that year, Jacobs stated that her ideal storyline would be for Donna {{to find a good}} man and gain a promotion, hoping she would find someone who would treat her well and help her give up her recreational drug habit. Her love interests included physiotherapist Justin Fuller, registrars Ed Keating (Rocky Marshall) and Mubbs Hussein (Ian Aspinall), manager Bradley Hume, senior house officer Sean Thompson (Chinna Wodu), and a love triangle with married consultant Michael Spence and his cardiothoracic colleague Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Although Michael did not initially disclose to Donna that he was married, Jacobs stated that her character was aware of this [...] "deep down", but was unfortunately unperturbed. He treated her badly, to the point that he would only have sex with her in a toilet stall; nonetheless Jacobs assessed that Donna was in love with him, believing him to be [...] "the one" [...] and different from her previous lovers, branding her deluded in this respect.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{significant}} restoration {{was carried out}} in 1550 by the painters Lancelot Blondeel and Jan van Scorel, following the earlier and poorly executed cleaning by Jan van Scorel, that led to damage to the predella. The 1550 undertaking was performed with a care and reverence that a contemporary account writes of [...] "such love that <b>they</b> <b>kissed</b> that skilful work in art in many places". The predella was destroyed by fire in the 16th century. Comprising a strip of small square panels and executed in water based paints, it showed hell or limbo with Christ arriving to redeem those about to be saved. During the Protestant Reformation the piece was moved out of the chapel to prevent damage in the Beeldenstorm, first to the attic and later to the town hall, where it remained for two decades. In 1662 the Ghent painter Antoon van den Heuvel was commissioned to clean the Ghent Altarpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Hashizume and Ida begin {{searching for}} a place to live together, but no one wants to rent an {{apartment}} to two unrelated men, saying they would be messy and less reliable for payments and renewing. Kobayashi wonders if it's an excuse to avoid renting to a gay couple. Ida suggests one of them adopt the other, which would be the equivalent of gay marriage. This would also allow them to say that they are brothers for the purposes of renting. Hashizume initially rejects the idea, causing Ida to think he does not love him. They have an argument in which Ida accuses Hashizume of having never said [...] "I love you" [...] and Hashizume ends up slapping Ida and running off.

2500|$|It later emerges that Zoe {{is in fact}} Kat's daughter, {{born after}} Kat was raped by her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick), and was adopted by Kat's parents, Charlie and Viv.

[...] Phillipps liked that Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle as it was [...] "quite relatable" [...] for everyone. He thought the reaction to it had been mixed, but there had been support for Amber and Daniel. A few weeks later, Josh walked in on Amber and Daniel kissing. Bonner told an Inside Soap reporter that Josh was devastated by the scene {{and did not want to}} hear Amber's apology. Josh eventually went to the penthouse to speak with Daniel and came close to hitting him.

We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now.
