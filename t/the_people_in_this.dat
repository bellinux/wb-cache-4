25|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{among the}} Ghilji reveal strong links between tribal affiliation and {{membership in the}} larger ummah (Islamic community). Afghan historians believe that most Pashtuns are descendants of Qais Abdur Rashid, who is purported {{to have been an}} early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the early Pashtun population. The legend says that after Qais heard of the new religion of Islam, he travelled to meet Muhammad in Medina and returned to Afghanistan as a Muslim. He purportedly had four children: Sarban, Batan, Ghourghusht and Karlan. Before the Islamization of their territory, the Pashtuns likely followed various religions. Some may have been Buddhists while others Zoroastians, worshippers of the sun, or worshippers of Nana, with some probably being animists, shamanists and Jews. However, there is no conclusive evidence to these theories {{other than the fact that}} these were the religions practiced by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century.|$|E
25|$|Under these circumstances, {{later that}} year, Marius was triumphantly elected consul for 107 BC. He was campaigning against Metellus's {{apparent}} lack of swift action against Jugurtha. Because of the repeated military debacles from 113 BC to 109 BC and the accusations that the oligarchy was open to flagrant bribery, it became easier for the virtuous new man {{who had worked with}} difficulty up the ladder of offices to be elected {{as an alternative to the}} inept or corrupt nobility. The Senate had a trick up its sleeve, however. In accordance with the provisions of the Lex Sempronia on Consular provinces, which dictated that the Senate in a given year was to determine the Consular provinces for the next year at the end of year before the elections, the Senate decided not to make the war against Jugurtha one of the provinces and to prorogue Metellus in Numidia. Marius got around this through a ploy that had been used in 131 BC. In that year there was a dispute as to who should command the war against Aristonicus in Asia, and a tribune had passed a law authorizing an election to select the commander (there was precedent for this procedure from the Second Punic War). A similar law was passed in 108 BC and Marius was voted the command by <b>the</b> <b>People</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> special election. Metellus shed bitter tears when he learned of the decision. Upon returning home, he avoided meeting Marius, and was granted a Triumph and the agnomen Numidicus (conqueror of Numidia).|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{this well}} {{plays a major}} role in joining <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> part of the country, {{breaking}} the caste based discrimination preveals among them. Before and during the period of Lord Vaikundar, this part of the subcontinent was under the grip of feudalism, casteism and untouchability. There were separate wells and tanks for each caste, and people from the other caste were not allowed to draw out water from those wells. As in the Vinchai, since the social aim of 'uplifting the lowely treated people in the society' occupies a major part in the spiritual mission of Vaikundar which is projected towards the ideal Dharma Yukam, he wanted to stop this evil practice. So as the first step to reach this aim, this well is established at Swamithoppe. Apart from religious sacredness this well was also a historical icon since it was the first well in this part of the country where people could use water freely irrespective of their caste.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the speech}} Bannon invoked the Christian {{concept of the}} Church Militant.

[...] Bannon {{went on to say}} [...] "I believe we've come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years." [...] Bannon maintained that [...] "the West" [...] was successful due to a capitalism based on [...] "the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief." [...] Which was under threat from [...] "state-sponsored capitalism... you see in China and Russia.", from [...] "Ayn Rand or Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism", and from [...] "immense secularization of the West... the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration [...]" [...] Bannon held that the undermining of [...] "enlightened capitalism", and the loss of [...] "Judeo-Christian belief" [...] he held it was based on, were in dangerous decline right as [...] "we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism" [...] which includes Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram [...] "and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war". Bannon called on Christian capitalists to examine the purpose of their wealth and if divine providence was calling on them [...] "to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth...and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things... bind together as partners with others in other countries" [...] which would better prepare the West at these [...] "the very beginning stages of a global conflict".|$|E
