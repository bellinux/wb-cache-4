25|$|The entire {{decision-making}} process surrounding the stadium, including its design and cost, was heavily criticised, both by supporters, {{media and the}} political opposition in Gothenburg. Points of criticism included the big mystery making and hastiness around the decision, the lack of visions including the tight budget, and the involvement of too much politics in the process. Some of the criticism was addressed: the budget was increased slightly to allow closed corners, but several issues were never discussed. One such issue was having Brøndby Stadion as an inspiration for the stadium, since <b>this</b> <b>arena</b> later {{had to go through}} an overhaul since the commercial areas were deemed insufficient.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin and Melisende {{agreed to}} put the {{decision}} to the Haute Cour. The Haute Cour decided that Baldwin would rule {{the north of the}} kingdom and Melisende the richer Judea and Samaria, and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus for her to do so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility in <b>this</b> <b>arena.</b> The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria.|$|E
