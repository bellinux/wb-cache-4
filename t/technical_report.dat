40|$|The I- 5 Columbia River Crossing (CRC) Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) {{presents}} information summarized {{from numerous}} technical documents. Most {{of these documents}} are discipline-specific <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> (e. g., archeology, noise and vibration, navigation, etc.). These reports include a detailed explanation of the data gathering and analytical methods used by each discipline team. The methodologies were reviewed by federal, state and local agencies before analysis began. The <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> are longer and more detailed than the DEIS and should be referred to for information beyond that which {{is presented in the}} DEIS. For example, findings summarized in the DEIS are supported by analysis in the <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and their appendices. The DEIS organizes the range of alternatives differently than the <b>technical</b> <b>reports.</b> Although the information contained in the DEIS was derived from the analyses documented in the <b>technical</b> <b>reports,</b> this information is organized differently in the DEIS than in the reports. The following explains these differences. The following details the significant differences between how alternatives are described, terminology, and how impacts are organized in the DEIS and in most <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> so that readers of the DEIS can understand where to look for information in the <b>technical</b> <b>reports.</b> Some <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> do not exhibit all these differences from the DEIS.

40|$|Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) has {{conducted}} surveys {{on the science}} and technology grey literature since 1962. According to a survey in 2006, <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and conference proceedings are becoming the most important grey literature for the researchers in Korea because most research results are stored in <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and presented at conferences. Despite their importance, these grey literatures have been in difficulty for access and acquisition. As a national science and technology information center, KISTI has put effort into acquisition and distribution of <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and conference proceedings on science and technology for easy access. KISTI has transformed the grey literature into the white literature to support R&D researchers. This paper examines the acquisition and distribution status and analyzes the usage statistics for <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and conference proceedings in Korea. Both of the printed and electronic grey literatures are included in this study. For examination of the electronic grey literature status, records in National Discovery for Science Leaders (NDSL) and Science and Technology Society Village are used and for the printed grey literature KISTI collections are used. KISTI has acquired and distributed domestic and foreign <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and conference proceedings. KISTI provides metadata and the full-text of R&D <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> (131, 324 titles) produced by government funded projects and conference proceedings (457 titles) through NDSL. The conference proceedings can also be accessed through Science and Technology Society Village in which researchers make online communities. For analysis of usage statistics for <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> and conference proceedings, frequency of full-text download and document delivery service are used. The KISTI statistics system so called Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) shows that conference proceedings and <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> are being used 1, 661, 100 times and 448, 514 times respectively from March 2010 to February 2011. These statistics indicate that open access for conference proceedings and <b>technical</b> <b>reports</b> is in heavy use by the researchers in Korea.

25|$|However, an {{unfavourable}} <b>technical</b> <b>report</b> of {{the prototype}} was also {{produced by the}} Directorate of Aeronautical Construction of the Air Ministry. Amongst its findings, it judged the placing of the integral fuel tanks within the wings to be highly vulnerable and prone to leaks, as well as posing some difficulty to manufacture. The negative conclusions of the <b>technical</b> <b>report</b> directly led to an initial for 12 pre-production aircraft, which had been drafted towards {{the latter half of}} the flight test programme, to be cancelled, along with the instruction to proceed given to Reggiane to prepare the tooling necessary for a wider production run of 188 aircraft. While some consideration was made at Reggiane towards the adoption of a more conventional three-spar wing with normal fuel tanks instead, only a prototype conforming to this configuration was authorised (this subsequently became the basis for the Reggiane Re.2002 ground attack aircraft).|$|E

It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC <b>technical</b> <b>report</b> in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994. It was approved as a draft <b>technical</b> <b>report</b> (DTR/DIS) in November 1994, finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998. The reference software in C language was later published as a freely available ISO standard. Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems, it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding (DSP based) of compressed audio. Some other real time implementation of MPEG Audio encoders and decoders were available for the purpose of digital broadcasting (radio DAB, television DVB) towards consumer receivers and set top boxes.|$|E
