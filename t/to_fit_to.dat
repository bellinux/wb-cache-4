5|$|When Oblivion did open, {{the area}} was re-themed {{to look like a}} {{sinister}} government facility, unlike Fantasy World's fairground theme, and renamed X-Sector. The only surviving ride from Fantasy World, the Black Hole roller coaster, was also changed; the large tent that it was situated in was repainted to blue and silver instead of green and yellow stripes. To make the new X-Sector a major ride area, Alton Towers added two old rides {{from other parts of the}} park: Energizer and Enterprise (both from Festival Park, now Dark Forest). Both rides were repainted <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> the new theme.|$|E

25|$|In 2010 Kilkenny {{defeated}} Galway in an eagerly-anticipated {{but ultimately}} disappointing provincial decider. A 1-19 to 1-12 victory gave Shefflin an eleventh Leinster medal. In the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final defeat of Cork, Shefflin {{had to be}} substituted after he severed his cruciate ligament. While it was feared that this would rule {{him out of the}} All-Ireland decider against Tipperary on 5 September, he made a remarkable recovery and was deemed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> start that game. After scoring an early free in the final, his knee again gave out and he was replaced after twelve minutes. Tipperary's Lar Corbett subsequently ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals as Kilkenny fell to a 4-17 to 1-18 defeat.|$|E

[...] Shiban argued that the concept also worked because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season.

40|$|Orientation: The {{influence}} of the fit components of job embeddedness (<b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community) on job performance has not been extensively researched and the relationship is largely unknown. Research purpose: This study investigated the {{influence of}} the fit components of job embeddedness (employee <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community) on employees’ job performance. Motivation for the study: There is a dearth of studies on the fit components of job embeddedness and the relationship with job performance in developing countries especially in Southern Africa. Research design, approach and method: This cross-sectional study made use of a quantitative survey design. The target population comprised employees working in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sector (n = 452). Main findings: The results revealed that employee <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community positively influences employees’ job performance. Practical/managerial implications: The findings have implications for human resource managers in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sector, who are encouraged <b>to</b> consider the three <b>fit</b> factors of job embeddedness during the job applicants interviewing process as they have a significant potential to influence job performance. Contribution/value-addition: The research is one of the primary research papers to investigate the direct effects of the fit components of job embeddedness on employee job performance within the Zimbabwean context. It provides a rich platform for further studies and replication in other industry sectors especially within the African context...|$|R

2500|$|Clément is {{reported}} to have begun manufacture of Clément Tyres in 1878 <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> the early cycles, but the French identity was lost with the overwhelming success of his Dunlop pneumatics. After World War I, Clément Pneumatics was established in Italy and was a leading supplier of Clément Pneumatici bicycle tyres throughout much of the 20th century. A leading international manufacturer during the 1950s,1960s and 1970s, it was associated with racing cyclists such as Eddy Merckx, Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, and Ole Ritter. It was purchased by Pirelli in the 1980s and manufacturing was moved to Thailand until 1995 when Pirelli vacated the bicycle tyre market. [...] Various licensing arrangements were of little consequence until, in 2010 the name was licensed to Donnelly Sports and the American, Don Kellogg, who recommenced manufacture in Thailand.|$|E

2500|$|The {{external}} {{diameter of the}} globe itself was [...] The frame was formed by 32 large wooden trusses which were in turn supported by a brick enclosure rendered externally in cement. Between the trusses were smaller horizontal ribs from which zinc bands supported plaster casts {{of the features of}} the earth created from clay originals. There were about 6,000 of these plaster casts, each about [...] square and [...] thick. These castings had proved particularly problematic– not only did they have to butt together perfectly but they also had to have a tiny curvature <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> the concave interior of the shell– Wyld had needed three attempts to perfect the design. The production procedure was also time-consuming: the appropriate scale section of the Earth's surface would first be traced out on paper, then transferred to clay modelled with the appropriate topography, from which a mould would be taken; the mould was then tried and any corrections made before a final cast was produced and passed to the painters for decoration.|$|E
