It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much.|$|E

When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied [...] "Well, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much, we appreciate that...asshole." [...] This became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness, with slogans such as [...] "Ask Why, Asshole", a variation on Enron's official slogan [...] "Ask why".
