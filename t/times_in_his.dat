5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1798 a British {{fleet of}} 13 ships {{of the line}} and one fourth rate ship under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{discovered}} a French fleet of 13 ships {{of the line and}} four frigates at anchor in Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Nelson had been in pursuit of the French for three months, crossing the Mediterranean three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> efforts to locate the fleet and a convoy under its protection which carried the French army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte intended for the invasion of Egypt. The convoy successfully eluded Nelson and the army landed at Alexandria on 31 June, capturing the city and advancing inland. The fleet was too large to anchor in Alexandria harbour and instead Bonaparte ordered its commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers to take up station in Aboukir Bay.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{struck out}} ten or more batters eleven <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, and {{achieved}} his career high of 12 strikeouts four times; {{but due to}} characteristically low run support, he won only one of those four games, a 5–0 three-hit shutout of Kansas City on September 25, 1955 in which he recorded his 1,000th career strikeout. He also recorded 12 strikeouts in a 4–2, 12-inning loss to the Philadelphia Athletics on July 24, 1953, in a 10-inning scoreless tie against the Tigers on May 9, 1954, and in a 3–1 loss at Baltimore on May 23, 1961 in which he pitched only six innings.
