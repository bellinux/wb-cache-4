25|$|Evolutionary {{biologists}} {{are skeptical}} of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome. However, many researchers claim {{that the ability to}} acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Non-biologists also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> our ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the evolutionary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires speech production skills and abilities as well as multisensory integration of sensory processing abilities.|$|E

25|$|Many Orthodox Jews {{view the}} Written and Oral Torah {{as the same}} as Moses taught, for all {{practical}} purposes. Conservative Jews <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> much of the Oral law is divinely inspired, while Reform and Reconstructionist Jews tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. Traditionally, the Reform movement held that Jews were obliged to obey the ethical but not the ritual commandments of Scripture, although today many Reform Jews have adopted many traditional ritual practices. Karaite Jews traditionally consider the Written Torah to be authoritative, viewing the Oral Law as only one possible interpretation of the Written Torah.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} microsociology aims {{to focus on}} {{individual}} behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, Erving Goffman, claims that humans <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.|$|E
25|$|Much {{recent work}} has been done to {{identify}} the underlying causes of conversion and related disorders and to better understand why conversion and hysteria appear more commonly in women. Current theoreticians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there is no single cause for these disorders. Instead, the emphasis tends to be on the individual understanding of the patient and a variety of therapeutic techniques. In some cases, the onset of conversion disorder correlates to a traumatic or stressful event. There are also certain populations that are considered at risk for conversion disorder, including people suffering from a medical illness or condition, people with personality disorder, and individuals with dissociative identity disorder. However, no biomarkers have yet been found to support the idea that conversion disorder is caused by a psychiatric condition.|$|E

50|$|The {{determinants}} {{and consequent}} {{stability of the}} velocity of money are a subject of controversy across and within schools of economic thought. Those favoring a quantity theory of money have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> {{in the absence of}} inflationary or deflationary expectations, velocity will be technologically determined and stable, and that such expectations will not generally arise without a signal that overall prices have changed or will change.|$|R
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Universal Pictures {{near the end of}} their horror film period. According to legend, as the result of its pending merger with International Pictures, Universal Pictures adopted a policy against releasing any more B movies, so sold The Brute Man [...] for $125,000 to poverty row's Producers Releasing Corporation, which distributed the film without any mention of Universal's involvement in publicity or credits. [...] In fact, Universal released at least one B-western following the merger, and still had numerous other titles in active circulation from the preceding few years, {{at the time of the}} merger. [...] Most experts <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Universal simply found the exploitation of the deceased Hatton and his deformity for the third time, in his last film (in which evidence of his impending demise may be foreshadowed in his acting), and of a poorly-developed story, to be detrimental to its corporate image but did not want to take a financial loss by simply shelving the film permanently.|$|E
500|$|Strang's disciples {{today are}} divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding High Priest, who does not claim to have the {{authority}} or priesthood office possessed by Joseph Smith or James Strang. [...] The other claims that the first faction is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang's organization. [...] This second group claims {{that it is the}} sole true remnant of James Strang's church. [...] Missionary work is no longer emphasized among the Strangites (unlike the LDS and many other Latter Day Saint sects), as they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> after three murdered prophets (Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and James Strang) God closed His dispensation to the [...] "gentiles" [...] of the West. Consequently, Strang's church has continued to dwindle until the present day. [...] Current membership figures vary between 50 and 300 persons, depending upon the source consulted.|$|E
50|$|Often {{viewed in}} the Italy of the time as a god-like figure, Mazzini was {{nonetheless}} denounced by many of his compatriots as a traitor. Contemporary historians <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he ceased <b>to</b> contribute anything productive or useful after 1849, but modern ones take a more favorable opinion of him. The antifascist Mazzini Society, founded in the United States in 1939 by Italian political refugees, took his name; they, like him, served Italy from exile.|$|R
50|$|Until , many anthropologists {{had doubts}} that the canoe-legends {{described}} a deliberate migration, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the migration occurred accidentally when seafarers became lost and drifted to uninhabited shores. In 1947 Thor Heyerdahl sailed the Kon-Tiki, a balsa-wood raft, from South America into the Pacific {{in an attempt}} to show that humans could have settled Polynesia from the eastern shores of the Pacific Ocean, with sailors using the prevailing winds and simple construction techniques.|$|R

The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of [...] "Blue Moon", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto {{as though it were a}} heroic anthem. City supporters <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results [...] "typical City". Events that fans regard as [...] "typical City" [...] include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58), or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 2004–05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who believe}} in the idea that ageing is an {{unavoidable}} side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma theories) logically <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> attempts to delay ageing would result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions. Altering ageing is therefore [...] "impossible", and study of ageing mechanisms is of only academic interest.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, some popular, nonacademic sources {{claim that}} spirituals and other songs, such as [...] "Steal Away" [...] or [...] "Follow the Drinking Gourd", {{contained}} coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad.

50|$|Many {{questions}} arise about the living conditions that man imposes {{on the domestic}} horse. They are frequently distanced {{from the life of}} the species in the wild. The horse is a naturally sociable animal, which does not react well to isolation. It can even become depressed and stop eating if its need for contact is not met. However, the horse can also experience unintentional suffering, in many cases resulting from ignorance or neglect. Man also <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the horse should be permanently available. A deficit in the living conditions offered to horses often creates problems in the human-horse relationship.|$|R

50|$|The courts became quickly unpopular. This was {{not only}} because of the express {{prohibition}} of jury trials or the fact <b>that</b> vice-admiralty judges <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> common law courts did not have superior status. It was also because a whole range of technical issues confused the legal system. It was often not clear whether vice-admiralty courts had jurisdiction over creeks or bays, or whether the governor could create vice-admiralty courts through vice-regal powers, or whether or not there was a clear method of separating the jurisdictions and procedures of vice-admiralty and common law jurisdiction. As a consequence of this, vice-admiralty courts became ineffective and, as many colonists perceived, unjust.|$|R
2500|$|Some contemporaries, such as Stefano Landi, {{mentioned}} that Kapsberger {{was not as}} meticulous a composer as he was as a performer.

Prominent among these critics is lutenist Rolf Lislevand: in his words, [...] "Kapsberger was as bad a composer as he was a fine instrumentalist [...] The ideas are often badly developed, and are freely associated with one another; no real musical discourse is built up [...] the rhythmeven after serious efforts at fathoming itwavers between inspired cleverness and total confusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally, Christians {{believe that}} the promised New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper {{as part of the}} Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John {{includes}} the New Commandment. Based on the Bible teaching that, [...] "For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. [...] For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth," [...] Protestants <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the New Covenant only came into force with the death of Christ. The commentary to the Roman Catholic New American Bible also affirms that [...] Christ is the [...] "testator whose death puts his will into effect." [...] Christians thus believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and that the Blood of Christ shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of Hume's epistemology {{is the problem}} of induction. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go [...] "beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory". Hume argues that we <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is [...] "consistent and conceivable" [...] that nature might stop being regular. Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because {{it has been in the}} past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on Bob Zajonc’s views on {{unconscious}} emotion, especially {{in the context of}} the debates about the independence of affect and cognition. Historically, Bob was always interested in the “mere”—basic, fundamental processes. His empirical demonstrations of precognitive and preconscious emotional processes, combined with his elegant expositions of them, sharply contrasted with cold and complex cognitive models. Interestingly, Bob <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> whereas the causes of emotion can be unconscious, the emotional state itself <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be conscious. However, he reconsidered this assumption and in his later work showed that subjects in affective priming experiments do not experience conscious affect, but instead act on basic preferences. Today, Bob’s insights continue to inspire research on “unconscious emotion. ...|$|R
