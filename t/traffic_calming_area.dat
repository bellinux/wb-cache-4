40|$|PURPOSES: This study aims {{to suggest}} the optimal spacing between speed humps which is placed at <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>areas</b> {{including}} pedestrian priority zones, school zones, and residential areas. METHODS: The study measured the operating speed of vehicles passing through two successive humps by using laser gun in 0. 2 seconds interval, and analysed the basic statistical characteristics of speeds data to have an insight {{on the relationship between}} spacing and speed. Assumption was made to derive the maximum spacing within which two successive humps influence each other. RESULTS: The statistically significant model explaining the relationship between spacing and 85 th percentile speed of vehicles was derived as well as the maximum spacing maintained in order to take the benefits of successive installation of humps.

However, their effect {{on the development of}} child pedestrian skills is unknown. This project reviewed relevant literature and re-examined existing data on child pedestrian exposure in <b>calmed</b> and uncalmed <b>areas.</b> This was followed by an empirical study which compared the pedestrian skills and exposure of children growing up in a <b>traffic</b> <b>calmed</b> <b>area</b> to those in a nearby 'untreated' control area. Pupils in schools local to each area were tested, and their parents/guardians interviewed. The study found little difference in the total exposure of children to traffic on local roads in <b>calmed</b> and control <b>areas,</b> although the patterns of exposure changed to some extent. Samples of 7 - 9 year old children from schools within the <b>calmed</b> <b>area</b> and the un-calmed control area were given both PC based and roadside tests of visual timing and gap selection, and a safe crossing location test. Although small differences were detected, none of the results showed any major difference in scores between children from the two areas, although scores did improve with age. It is possible that individual differences in pupils' road safety skills is due more to factors such as the attitudes of parents towards road safety, and differences between schools (overall academic ability) than to whether they live in a calmed or un-calmed environment...|$|R

The results reveal that speed humps are effective in reducing speed and that tandem speed humps are more effective than single speed humps in speed reduction.

In this study, therefore, the experiences of more than 20 design measures were gathered and analysed in order to judge which measures fit a `sustainably safe' approach. The measures analysed were, among other things: separation of driving directions, construction of cycle lanes (non-compulsory or of a different colour), complete reconstruction of a road and a junction, and various other measures usually meant to lower speeds. The measures were grouped as much as possible and analysed as a type of measure. The possibility of drawing well-founded conclusions was limited, because some types were rare and some of the relevant information was missing. Clearly positive results were achieved by the separation of driving directions, such as the double axis marking on rural roads. These were preferably complemented by extra provisions between the two stripes. Also scoring well were reconstructions in which at least the speed on junctions was lowered...|$|R
