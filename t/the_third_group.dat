5|$|Nedvěd scored {{his first}} senior {{international}} goal in his nation's Group C match against Italy, putting the Czech Republic {{in the lead}} 1–0 after four minutes.

Nedvěd played in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match, against Russia, receiving his second yellow card of the tournament as the Czechs tied 3–3 {{to advance to the}} knockout stage.|$|E
5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>group,</b> four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E

He replaced Radek Bejbl in the second group match, against France, coming on after 49 minutes in the 2–1 loss. Lokvenc appeared in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match against Denmark, although due to both teams having lost both of their previous matches, neither team could advance to {{the next round of}} the competition. He came on after 79 minutes, replacing Vladimír Šmicer in a 2–0 win for his nation.|$|E
5|$|Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd {{was unable}} to train {{normally}} due to an ankle injury. The Czechs' first match (against the Netherlands) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite two shots on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. He played in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match, against Denmark; despite the Czechs' 2–0 victory, the team was eliminated from the tournament. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided {{to put an end to}} the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|In August 1962, Chaffee {{confided in}} his family that he had {{submitted}} an application for the NASA astronaut training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a test pilot for astronaut status. In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of NASA astronauts. After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered {{him the opportunity to}} continue work on his master's degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, to work on his Master of Science degree in Reliability Engineering.|$|E
5|$|The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>group,</b> who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{assignments}} for Gemini8 {{were announced}} on September 20, 1965, with Armstrong as Command Pilot and David Scott as Pilot. Scott {{was the first}} member of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of astronauts to receive a prime crew assignment. The mission launched on March 16, 1966; it was to be the most complex yet, with a rendezvous and docking with the unmanned Agena target vehicle, the second American extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10a.m. EST, the Titan II carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02am EST, putting them into an orbit from where they would chase the Agena.|$|E
5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his {{plan of attack}} against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished to use his squadron's frigates in {{the assault on the}} city, the seas were too rough to ensure their safety close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions under the command of Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of boats would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>group</b> {{are those}} churches {{established}} as new cathedrals since the Reformation. They include five great medieval abbey churches established as new cathedrals under Henry VIII: Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and Peterborough. Five further large churches later became cathedrals: St Albans and Southwark, which were of monastic foundation, and Manchester, Ripon, and Southwell, which were collegiate churches (and {{all of which}} consequently combine the functions of cathedral and parish church). Westminster Abbey was a Benedictine monastery that became a cathedral after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but only for ten years.|$|E
