5|$|Aloin, a {{compound}} {{found in the}} exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) laxative products in the United States until 2002 when <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it failed to provide the necessary safety data. Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically. Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce side effects.|$|E

It is effective at relieving pain associated with back aches, and is registered with <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration as a physical medicine device under the classification therapeutic electric massager.

5000|$|Other Acts and Regulations also specify {{inspection}} {{requirements and}} for certain trade requirements, {{the need to}} register with CFIA to conduct business. Such companies are termed [...] "registered establishments" [...] {{as opposed to those}} [...] "non-federally registered establishments" [...] that fall solely under <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drugs</b> Act. While <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drugs</b> Act provide for core food safety standards, many companies opt to use third party standards such as HACCP or ISO in order to meet client specified standards. These standards are closely adhered to due to the potential loss of business.|$|R
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals is {{banned in the}} member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was {{the first state to}} enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. Toothpaste with fluoride {{is very important}} to the restoration of dental health. Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs that increase the amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Lilly was an {{advocate}} of federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, {{and many of his}} suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting in the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into {{one of the largest and}} most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration under the name Enovid.

5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. Bush administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E

He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work.

Boisselier said that <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E
