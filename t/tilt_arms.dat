We investigated {{the effects of}} upper-limb tilting on radial augmentation index (rAIx) and related central measures [aortic augmentation index (aAIx) ]. Methods: In 45 volunteers (age 49 ± 19 years), supine brachial BP and radial artery waveforms were obtained by applanation tonometry with the dominant arm stretched and gently supported in three different positions: at the heart level, with the BP cuff 15 cm above heart level (approximately + 30 °), and 15 cm below heart level (- 30 °). Results: Brachial SBP/DBP was 120 / 68 ± 17 / 8 mmHg. Mean arterial pressure changed predictably with <b>arm</b> <b>tilting</b> (99 ± 12 mmHg at - 30 °, 88 ± 10 mmHg at 0 °, 77 ± 11 mmHg at + 30 °, all P < 0. 001). rAIx decreased at - 30 ° (69 ± 22 %), and increased at + 30 ° (93 ± 20 %) compared with 0 ° (82 ± 20 %, all P less than 0. 001). Changes in rAIx (value at + 30 ° minus value at - 30 °) showed an inverse relationship with age (r = - 0. 32, P = 0. 03). Heart rate, BP and rAIx did not change in the contralateral arm, which {{was held at the}} heart level during the examination. aAIx followed the same pattern as rAIx (123 ± 27 % at - 30 °, 144 ± 33 % at + 30 °, 136 ± 31 % at 0 °, all P less than 0. 001); changes in rAIx and aAIx were strongly related each other (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Acute gravitational upper-limb BP changes generate opposite, profound changes in rAIx, and major artifactual changes in aAIx. These findings provide a rationale for recommending to keep the upper limb at the heart level during radial waveform assessment. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Scapular motion during arm {{elevation}} {{is frequently}} evaluated {{in patients with}} shoulder disorders because it provides clinically useful information. With the development of measurement devices and improvement in accuracy, comparisons under various conditions have recently been reported. However, {{in most of these}} reports, the subjects examined were limited to males, or a mixed population of males and females. Only a few reports have described sex differences. In the current study, we performed three-dimensional dynamic analysis of arm elevation and investigated whether there is a sex difference in scapular motion. 				 					Methods: Subjects included 18 healthy adult males (18 shoulders) and 19 healthy adult females (19 shoulders). Thirty-seven shoulders were on the dominant side. The age range was 20. 5  ±  0. 03 years. Subjects performed scapular plane arm elevation, and kinematic data were recorded using an electromagnetic tracking device. Scapular upward rotation and internal rotation angles and the posterior <b>tilt</b> angle accompanying <b>arm</b> elevation were calculated from recorded data. Changes in each angle during scapular motion were recorded according to sex. 				 					Results: There were sex differences in scapular upward rotation and internal rotation angles. The upward rotation angle was significantly greater in males, whereas the internal rotation angle was significantly greater in females. No sex differences were noted in the scapular posterior tilt angle. 				 					Discussion: Findings of this study may serve as basic data for scapular motion during scapular plane elevation in healthy males and females. In addition, it is necessary to evaluate and treat the shoulder while taking sex differences in scapular movement into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Contraction of {{skeletal}} and cardiac {{muscle is}} regulated by Ca 2 +-dependent structural changes in troponin {{that control the}} interaction between myosin and actin. We measured the orientations of troponin domains in skeletal muscle fibers using polarized fluorescence from bifunctional rhodamine probes on the C and E helices of troponin C. The C helix, in the regulatory head domain, tilts by ≈ 30 ° when muscle is activated in physiological conditions, with a Ca 2 +-sensitivity {{similar to that of}} active force. Complete inhibition of active force did not affect C-helix orientation, and binding of rigor myosin heads did not affect its orientation at saturating [Ca 2 +]. The E helix, in the IT <b>arm</b> of troponin, <b>tilted</b> by ≈ 10 ° on activation, and this was reduced to only 3 ° when active force was inhibited. Binding of rigor myosin heads produced a larger tilt of the E helix. Thus, in situ, the regulatory head acts as a pure Ca 2 +-sensor, whereas the IT arm is primarily sensitive to myosin head binding. The polarized fluorescence data from active muscle are consistent with an in vitro structure of the troponin core complex in which the D and E helices of troponin C are collinear. The present data were used to orient this structure in the fiber and suggest that the IT arm is at ≈ 30 ° to the filament axis in active muscle. In relaxed muscle, the IT <b>arm</b> <b>tilts</b> to ≈ 40 ° but the D/E helix linker melts, allowing the regulatory head to tilt through a larger angle...|$|R
40|$|Despite > 50 {{years of}} {{research}} work since the discovery of sliding filament mechanism in muscle contraction, structural details of the coupling of cyclic cross-bridge movement to ATP hydrolysis are not yet fully understood. An example would be whether lever <b>arm</b> <b>tilting</b> on the myosin filament backbone will occur {{in the absence of}} actin. The most direct way to elucidate such movement is to record ATP-induced cross-bridge movement in hydrated thick filaments. Using the hydration chamber, with which biological specimens can be kept in an aqueous environment in an electron microscope, we have succeeded in recording ATP-induced cross-bridge movement in hydrated thick filaments consisting of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, with gold position markers attached to the cross-bridges. The position of individual cross-bridges did not change appreciably with time in the absence of ATP, indicating stability of time-averaged cross-bridge mean position. On application of ATP, individual cross-bridges moved nearly parallel to the filament long axis. The amplitude of the ATP-induced cross-bridge movement showed a peak at 5 – 7. 5 nm. At both sides of the filament bare region, across which the cross-bridge polarity was reversed, the cross-bridges were found to move away from, but not toward, the bare region. Application of ADP produced no appreciable cross-bridge movement. Because ATP reacts rapidly with the cross-bridges (M) to form complex (M·ADP·Pi) with an average lifetime > 10 s, the observed cross-bridge movement is associated with reaction, M + ATP → M·ADP·Pi. The cross-bridges were observed to return to their initial position after exhaustion of ATP. These results constitute direct demonstration of the cross-bridge recovery stroke...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} market for online grocery {{shopping}} requires improvement of operations and remaining {{ahead of the}} competition. The online supermarket {{is a relatively new}} market and has other challenges than regular warehouses due to order sizes and the products it handles; both fresh and preserved, but also fragile products. This influences several processes in the warehouse, of which order picking is the most expensive part of the operation. Therefore, ways to improve the order picking performance have been examined, resulting in the following research question: How can the overall manual picking performance, from a human perspective, in a warehouse be measured and improved? There are six decision factors for order picking in a warehouse that influence the performance: layout design, storage assignment, zoning, batching, routing and technical equipment selection. Next, the following three types of human factors play a large role in the order picking performance: physical, cognitive and organizational factors. All these factors have been researched individually, but seldom in combination with each other. Therefore, the focus of this research is on the influence of technical equipment on the physical and cognitive factors. In the warehouse of Picnic, the picking process is a manual procedure, where order pickers walk around with (mainly) pick carts with totes on it. They receive order lines on the scanner which is attached to their wrist. There are significant differences in picking speed between different order pickers. The picking speed depends on experience, but also on the ease of performing a certain action like scanning a product or grabbing a product. The biggest challenges for Picnic are the reduction of the most time-consuming components of the pick process. The duration of each of these components can be measured with a time and motion study. A Predetermine Time and Motion Study is used to carry out the time and motion study. Order pickers walked their order pick rounds with an action camera attached to their heads to make recordings of the pick process. This footage is analysed by labelling the actions an order picker performs when picking an order line: looking at the scanner, grabbing the product, scanning the product, putting the product in the tote, scanning the tote, walking with the pick cart, walking without the pick cart, walking with the product, inputting the quantity into the scanner, searching for the product, making a mistake, talking to other pickers. The analysed footage is used to determine the times spent on each of the actions. After determination of the times spent per action, they were compared to the Methods Time Measurement (MTM- 1) required times to determine the points of improvement. The relationship between the human factors and the actions of an order pick round have been determined. The order pickers can be divided into three groups; slow, medium and fast. The slow pickers take more time per action, they take more time walking, reading their scanner and picking the product. Fast pickers tend to combine more actions and therewith reduce time. The study also showed that there is more variance within the groups of the slow and medium pickers. The faster pickers are more experienced pickers. The most time-consuming actions when picking an order pick line are looking at the scanner (± 15 %) and walking (± 25 %). Looking at the scanner takes slow pickers almost twice as much time as medium or fast pickers. The slow pickers also spend more of their time walking with their pick cart than the medium and fast pickers. Next, the slow pickers walk slower than faster pickers. This results in more walking time for the slow pickers. Five alternatives to decrease the time spent on looking at the scanner and walking have been determined: 1. Change the scanner interface, in the current interface the letters are too small and there is too much information displayed 2. Optical head-mounted display, the removal of the action to lift and <b>tilt</b> the <b>arm</b> {{to be able to read}} the scanner will decrease the time to read the scanner 3. More totes per pick cart, an increase in pick cart size results in shorter distances between consecutive picks and therewith reducing the total time spent on walking 4. Automated pick carts, when pickers do not have to pull the pick carts anymore, they can walk faster 5. Batching, batching products to totes and totes to pick carts based on location in the pick circuit, makes it possible to make short-cuts and thus reducing the time spent on walking The interest of both pickers and Picnic are taken into account to determine the best alternative. The human factors of the pickers, like physical inconvenience and learning curve, should be as low as possible. These are determined by comparing the alternatives to the current situation. The costs of implementing the alternative should also be as low as possible. The order lines per hour should increase as much as possible; the number of order lines per hour is determined by using a discrete event simulation model. The interest of the picker and of Picnic is determined for each of the alternatives. Trade-offs have been made between the human factors, costs and order lines per hour, resulting in quick-wins and long-term alternatives. The quick-wins are the improvement of the scanner interface and the increase of the number of totes per pick cart. The long-term alternatives are the optical head-mounted display and the use of automated pick carts. The two quick-wins have been implemented in the warehouse and the first results are promising, the increase of the number of totes per pick cart size seems to lead to a decrease in time per order line of 18 %. However, this is based on a single pick round so no conclusions can be drawn yet. Also, the implementation of the improved scanner interface seems to work out well, the first reactions of the order pickers are that they can more easily read the scanners. However, also no conclusions can be drawn here since this has not been researched extensively. The picking performance is measured by determining the time spent on each element of an order line for an order picker. The most promising alternatives improve the picking performance in a warehouse where the operation is not completely automated. The future solutions are the use of automated pick carts and the use of optical head-mounted displays. Transport, Infrastructure and Logistic...|$|R
40|$| {{than the}} impact of trunk {{impairment}}. In a 10 m sprint, {{the impact of}} trunk impairment was limited compared {{to the impact of}} arm impairment. Also, trunk impairment did not {{have a major impact on}} a 20 m sprint with a turn. With the use of the wheelchair and strappings as permitted in wheelchair rugby, the velocity of the turn only depends on the linear velocity. In the relatively long sprint that was used in the turn test, trunk impairment had limited impact on linear velocity. However, it can be expected that in a turn made shortly after accelerating from standstill, trunk impairment does have an impact on turning velocity, caused by the impact of trunk on acceleration and thus linear velocity in the first meters. The effectiveness of a hit is determined by the position to make a legal hit and by the power of a hit. The position of the chairs is determined by acceleration, which is relevant because the rules in wheelchair rugby only allow a legal hit in front of the axle of the large wheel. In a game situation, athletes with TIC scores 0. 5 - 1. 5 will reach a position in which a legal hit by an athlete with TIC score 0 can no longer be made. In addition to that, athletes with TIC score 1. 5 will push themselves in a position where a legal hit cannot be made by athletes with TIC score 0. 5 The second determinant of effectiveness is the power of a hit. The power of a hit was defined as sprint momentum equivalent to the product of mass and maximum velocity. Athletes with TIC score 1. 0 and 1. 5 had a higher sprint momentum than athletes with TIC score 0. In conclusion, athletes with TIC scores 1. 0 and 1. 5 have the ability to push their chair into a position in which they legally can hit other athletes, and at the same time they cannot be hit by athletes with TIC scores 0 (and 0. 5). Furthermore, athletes with TIC scores 1. 5 and 1. 0 can produce a higher power of a hit than athletes with TIC score 0. This make the athletes with TIC score 1. 0 and 1. 5 much more proficient in hitting than athletes with TIC score 0. The final aspect that plays a role in proficiency in wheelchair rugby is the ability of the athlete to get out of a pick. The athlete can get out of this trapped position by manoeuvring the chair with sufficient power, which depends on sprint momentum. Or, a second option to get out of the trapped position is to tilt the wheelchair. A tilting height of at least 5 cm is necessary for an effective tilt. Athletes who could reach sufficient height in the tilt test had TIC scores of 1. 0 and 1. 5. Hence, athletes with TIC scores 1. 0 - 1. 5 are more proficient in getting out of a pick because they can tilt their chair with sufficient height and have a higher sprint momentum. The athletes in this study were allowed to use their own equipment during all tests to reflect sport specific performance, with the exception of the tilt test. The disadvantage of using personalised equipment is that findings are limited to the current game rules on allowed equipment, and generalisation of the findings to other wheelchair sports depends on the equipment permitted per sport. Furthermore, it is important to emphasise that changes in sport rules and equipment cannot be made without considering the related effects on classification systems. V The purpose of the fifth study was two-fold: 1) to determine if there is a relationship between objective, ratio scaled measures of trunk impairment and wheelchair activities that determine proficiency in Wheelchair Rugby and 2) to determine if “natural classes” can be identified in this relation. In the IPC Position Stand, it was stated that “natural classes may be indicated where the data indicate a clear cut-point in a continuous variable”. However, it was not defined what the difference in performance between two natural classes should be. In this fifth study, the relation was assessed for trunk muscle strength as the measure for impairment; the wheelchair activities assessed were those with the strongest relation with the TIC score (tilting the chair, power of a hit and acceleration in the first meter). Power of a hit was defined as the sprint momentum (mass of the athlete and the chair multiplied by the maximum velocity). For the present study, cluster analysis for trunk strength was performed. It was defined that a “natural class” exists if three criteria were met, 1) there was a significant difference between clusters of trunk muscle strength, 2) the median performance of the activity showed a better performance per cluster with increasing trunk muscle strength, 3) post hoc testing showed significant differences between clusters. We found a relation between trunk muscle strength in the forward direction and all measured activities. The relation was strongest for forward trunk muscle strength and sprint momentum (explained variance in performance 46 %) and tilting the chair (explained variance in performance 42 %). Only for the tilt test, two “natural classes” in the relation with trunk muscle strength were found. For the relation between trunk muscle strength and acceleration and sprint momentum the three defined criteria for “natural classes” were not met. The relation between trunk strength and acceleration and sprint momentum may have been affected by three limitations in the study. 1) As opposed to the <b>tilt</b> test, <b>arm</b> impairment does play a role in acceleration and sprint momentum. 2) Furthermore, tests for acceleration could not be performed without the use of personalised equipment. However, the use of equipment partially compensates for trunk impairment. Both arm impairment and the use of equipment may have obfuscated the relation between trunk muscle strength and acceleration and sprint momentum. 3) The complexity of classification research of a team sport like wheelchair rugby, may have effect on our outcome in two ways. a) To enable athletes with multiple impairment types and severity to compete in one team, all impairment types and severity must be summarized in one score that works for all. This combination of impairments is much more complex than classification in individual sports like athletics, where only athletes with the same impairment type compete in most races. b) In a team sport like wheelchair rugby, proficiency is determined by multiple activities. The weighing of these activities is unknown, and in addition to that, the activities an athlete performs is dependent on the athlete’s role in the team and not on what activities the athlete may be capable of doing. The model used in the current research, in which we assessed the relation of one impairment type out of all eligible impairment types with one activity as a fraction of all activities, is most likely too simple to detect “natural classes” in team sports. In conclusion, obtaining EBC in team sports is quite complex and not yet possible in accordance with all guidelines of the IPC Position Stand. First of all, the concept of “natural classes” needs a more precise definition. To determine if the concept of “natural classes” exists, the relation between impairment and activity limitation should first be assessed in individual sports that include one impairment type per competition and for which proficiency is determined by one or a few activities. At this moment, however team sports can start the development towards EBC by supporting the reliability and the validity of their classification systems in relation to objective measures for impairment by scientific research. In addition they can start research to identify the activities that determine performance in team sport. The results of the relation between impairment and activity limitation from individual sports may then be used for determining classes in team sports that have athletes with varied impairments grouped together into sport classes.
