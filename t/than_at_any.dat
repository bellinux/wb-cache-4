5|$|Although athletes {{representing}} Jamaica had won {{medals at}} every Olympic games since 1948 with the exceptions of the 1956 and 1964 games, the nation's {{delegation to the}} Beijing Olympics marked its most successful performance to that date <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other Olympic games. More athletes (50 in total, including more female athletes than ever before) competed for Jamaica in Beijing <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> previous Games, more gold medals were won (6 in Beijing alone, almost doubling the number of gold medals won in Jamaica's Olympic history) and more medals were won overall (11 medals, besting Jamaica's showing at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where 9 medals were won).|$|E

5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other time in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time since the advent of Humanism. Work by those with {{scientific}} as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E

5|$|That night American {{reinforcements}} arrived {{under the}} command of General Alexander Posey, who chose not to pursue the attackers and instead reported the situation to Colonel Zachary Taylor. Black Hawk asserted later that had Posey chose to attack him and his warriors that the blow dealt Black Hawk's band would have been decisive and war-ending. In fact, Dement's opinion was that there were more Native Americans at Kellogg's Grove <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other engagement during the war. The next day more reinforcements arrived when Captain Jacob Early's detachment reached the grove.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The {{truth is}} that Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited directly from the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other time before or since.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{estimates}} {{of the total number}} of people killed at Treblinka; most scholarly estimates range from 700,000 to 900,000, meaning that more Jews died at Treblinka <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz. The Treblinka museum in Poland states that at least 800,000 people died at Treblinka; Yad Vashem, which is Israel's Holocaust museum, puts the number killed at 870,000; and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gives a range of 870,000 to 925,000.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory in}} the ACC Championship Game had {{far-reaching}} sporting consequences for the 20072008 college football bowl season {{and in the future}} site of the ACC Championship Game. The 2007game injected approximately $10million into the Jacksonville economy. Thousands of hotel rooms were filled by fans traveling to the game, and the impact they created was larger than that of the previous year's game, which featured teams that had shorter distances to travel and whose fans had generated less demand for overnight accommodation. Despite the fact that fans spent more in 2007 <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> previous ACC Championship Game, poor ticket sales at the box office necessitated a move.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers during the last decade of his life <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
5|$|Crime {{continued}} to be a problem at the Anacostia Station late into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E
5|$|For Haiti, the 2008 Beijing Olympics marked its fourteenth {{appearance}} at any Olympic games and its seventh consecutive appearance since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Between that and its debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, Haitian teams competed at the Olympics {{that took place}} during 1924 (Paris), 1928 (Amsterdam), 1932 (Los Angeles), 1960 (Rome), 1972 (Munich, West Germany), and 1976 (Montreál, Canada). As of 2008, Haiti had not participated at a Winter Olympics. The delegation that Haiti sent to Beijing included seven athletes across three sports. With four female athletes, more women participated for Haiti in Beijing <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> single Olympic games before. Prior to Beijing, athletes from Haiti had won one silver medal (by Silvio Cator in 1928) and one bronze medal (by five athletes in 1924). Between then and including the 2008 Olympics, Haitian athletes had not won medals in any event. Moise Joseph, an athlete of the University of Florida, was destined to participate for Haiti in Beijing, but did not compete.|$|E

Its participation in Beijing marked its seventh consecutive appearance at the summer Olympics and its fourteenth appearance overall, with its first being at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. The Haitian Olympic team included seven athletes (three men and four women) participating in track and field (Barbara Pierre, Ginou Etienne, Nadine Faustin-Parker, and Dudley Dorival), boxing (Azea Austinama), and judo (Joel Brutus and Ange Jean Baptiste). More women participated for Haiti in 2008 <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> single Olympic games prior. Although Pierre and Dorival advanced to quarterfinals in their events, there were no Haitian medalists in Beijing. Brutus carried his country's flag at the ceremonies.|$|E

A rockumentary film made during the tour, entitled Lord Don't Slow Me Down directed by Dick Carruthers was released in October 2007. A second DVD included live footage from an Oasis gig in Manchester from 2 July 2005.|$|E

United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea, and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander, General Douglas MacArthur. After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian {{military was}} mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> other time.|$|E
