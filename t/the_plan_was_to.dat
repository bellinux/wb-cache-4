5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> scrap {{eleven of}} the vessels and keep only five {{to make the}} return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had been spent {{on the construction of}} Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls. As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build the castle's northern facade last.|$|E
5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} {{gained an}} order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, but <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> arm the production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and a battery of folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E

5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{introduce}} Cricket {{in schools}} and help youngsters understand and play the game.|$|R
50|$|Flanders {{took over}} as CEO of eHealth, Inc. after serving {{as a member of}} eHealth's board for eight years. Upon taking the reins at eHealth, Flanders {{developed}} a three-point plan to drive substantial growth that <b>was</b> announced <b>to</b> shareholders on October 27, 2016. The first point in <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> accelerate growth in eHealth's Medicare Advantage membership and significantly increase its market share in the Medicare supplement market. The second point in <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> significantly expand eHealth's market share in the small business insurance market. The third point in <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> drive higher sales volume in adjacent markets while expanding sales activities with existing and new eHealth members.|$|R
50|$|The Östhammar {{facility}} will have space for 6,000 capsules and <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> deposit 200 capsules into storage annually.|$|R
5|$|In {{memory of}} Henry II, Catherine decided {{to add a}} new chapel to the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood {{in the context of}} its planned setting. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> rent a {{house across the}} street from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2014, Modi {{launched}} the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ("Clean India") campaign. The stated {{goals of the}} campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> acquire further wagons {{to make up}} two rakes of wagons - one vacuum-braked and one air-braked set.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} version of the text library that uses termcap info, and the {{graphical}} library under X11.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> Smartlink buses {{priority}} over other traffic and passengers improved waiting environments with real time travel information.|$|R
5|$|On August 21, 1989, the 1/ weekday skip-stop service started. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have skip-stop service begin {{north of}} 116th Street–Columbia University, {{but due to}} objections, most notably that riders did not want 125th Street to be a skip-stop station, skip-stop service was only {{implemented}} north of 137th Street–City College between the hours of 6:30am and 7:00pm. All 1 trains skipped Marble Hill–225th, 207th, 191st and 145th Streets, while all 9 trains skipped 238th, 215th, Dyckman and 157th Streets. On September 4, 1994, midday skip-stop service was discontinued, and 191st Street {{was no longer a}} skip-stop station.|$|E
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be equipped with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{begin again}} in 1976, and seed typhoons by {{flying out of}} Guam. However, {{political}} issues blocked the plan. The People's Republic of China {{announced that it would}} not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E
50|$|On February 22, 2017, it was {{reported}} that the ship has <b>been</b> made upright. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> ship operational by April 2018.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> attract regular {{charters}} {{to bring}} tourists to Revelstoke and eventually develop {{the airport to}} implement regular commercial flights from other cities.|$|R
25|$|At formation, {{the size}} of the force was around 5000 soldiers; however, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> build a force {{the size of}} two to three brigades.|$|R
5|$|Another {{link between}} Europe and the Mongols was {{attempted}} in 1290, when the Genoese endeavored {{to assist the}} Mongols with naval operations. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> construct and man two galleys to attack Mamluk ships in the Red Sea, and operate a blockade of Egypt's trade with India. As the Genoese were traditional supporters of the Mamluks, this was {{a major shift in}} policy, apparently motivated by the attack of the Egyptian Sultan Qalawun on the Cilician Armenians in 1285. To build and man the fleet, a squadron of 800 Genoese carpenters, sailors and crossbowmen went to Baghdad, working on the Tigris. However, due to a feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Genoese soon degenerated into internal bickering, and killed each other in Basra, putting an end to the project. Genoa finally cancelled the agreement and signed a new treaty with the Mamluks instead.|$|E
5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, the festival of St James, when many officers would be away. The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> then seize control of a Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir to independence leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E
5|$|Charles's force {{consisted}} of 3,500 horse, organised into four brigades, the largest grouping being the 1,200 {{soldiers of the}} Northern Horse under Sir Marmaduke Langdale. In addition, there was Gerard's brigade, consisting of 800 men who had served under him in South Wales, Sir William Vaughan's 1,000-strong brigade, and the 200 members of the Life Guards, Charles's personal bodyguard, under Lord Bernard Stewart. Although experienced, the troops were depleted in number, and had low morale due to the recent string of defeats. Charles and Gerard evaded the loose Parliamentarian siege around the city, taking 600 men into Chester, while the approximately 3,000 remaining cavalry under Langdale crossed the River Dee at Holt and bivouacked at Hatton Heath, five {{miles to the south}} of Chester itself. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> trap the besiegers between the two forces, destroying them or forcing them to retreat; as they numbered only 500 cavalry and 1,500 foot, this was considered to be relatively simple.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{reintroduce}} a pride {{or two of}} wild, free-ranging Asiatic lions from Gir Forest in {{the neighboring}} Indian state of Gujarat to start with.|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} rail traffic volumes, revenue and productivity, modernise assets and separate out the commercial {{elements of the}} business from the non-commercial.|$|R
50|$|Water depths {{are not yet}} covered, {{because the}} {{database}} is not designed for three-dimensional coordinates. However, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> eventually integrate a bathymetric model to describe the seabed.|$|R
5|$|Created in {{the early}} 1930s, the salon {{was taken over by}} SS general Reinhard Heydrich and his {{subordinate}} Walter Schellenberg in 1939. The brothel was managed by original owner Kitty Schmidt throughout its entire existence. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> seduce top German dignitaries, foreign visitors as well as diplomats with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi-related topics and individuals. Notable guests included Heydrich himself, Joseph Dietrich, Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels. The building housing the salon was destroyed in an air raid in 1942 and the project quickly lost its importance. Salon Kitty has been the inspiration or subject to many brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{shifting}} front line, the 2nd Battalion's first major engagement of 1917 {{did not come}} until 9 April when, {{on the periphery of}} the Arras offensive, they took part in an attack on Hermies, one of the outpost villages of the Hindenburg Line. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Milligan, who had taken over on 17 March, the battalion had departed Haplincourt at 7:30pm the previous evening and marched to their form-up point. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attack with the battalion's four companies advancing side-by-side from the north-east to attack from behind the German defences, sweeping down on the village like a fan with the left-most company providing flank protection and establishing a series of posts to stop the garrison from escaping while the two centre and the right-most companies took the village. At the same time, two companies from the 3rd Battalion would attack the German main defensive position from the south-west.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Courtauld, {{wife of the}} {{industrialist}} and art collector Samuel Courtauld, {{promoted a}} popular series of subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel's advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor, with guest conductors as eminent as Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and Stravinsky. The Courtauld-Sargent concerts, as they became known, were aimed at people who had not previously attended concerts. They attracted large audiences bringing Sargent's name before another section of the public. In addition to the core repertory, Sargent introduced new works by Bliss, Honegger, Kodály, Martinů, Prokofiev, Szymanowski and Walton, among others. At first, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> engage the London Symphony Orchestra for these concerts, but the orchestra, a self-governing co-operative, refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub-standard. As a result, in conjunction with Beecham, Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra, the London Philharmonic.|$|E
50|$|When {{the media}} {{settlement}} {{was presented in}} June 2006, <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> launch a combined channel with children's programmes in the daytime and history programmes in the evening.|$|R
25|$|A {{military}} {{restructuring plan}} announced in July 2008 <b>was</b> <b>to</b> close BA 128 in 2011. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> base {{and place it}} in reserve status (Base Interarmes).|$|R
5000|$|It is {{all very}} well to aim for a more ‘abstract’ and a ‘cleaner’ {{approach}} tosemantics, but if <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any good, the operational aspects cannotbe completely ignored. (Scott70) ...|$|R
