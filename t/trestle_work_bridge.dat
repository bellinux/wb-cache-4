50|$|Eastern Ohio {{proved a}} {{difficult}} location for a railroad. Obstacles included the Muskingum River at Zanesville, 700 ft of excavation through the hard sandstone of the Blackhand Gorge along the Licking River between Zanesville and Newark, and {{large quantities of}} fill and <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> along the Big Walnut Creek. A tunnel in Cambridge had rockfalls and a cut near Barnesville had landslides.|$|R
5|$|The masonry for {{a bridge}} over the Plattekill Creek between Gardiner and New Paltz was {{completed}} by late June 1870, and <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> was done by July.

50|$|Multispan plate-girder bridges {{may be an}} {{economical}} way to span gaps {{longer than}} can be spanned by a single girder. Spacing of piers between the Abutments {{is dependent on the}} capacity of the selected plate girders. Separate plate girder bridges span between each pair of abutments in order to allow for expansion joints between the spans. Concrete is commonly used for low piers, while steel <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> may be used for high bridges.|$|R
50|$|Mågelibanen was a {{funicular}} {{with double}} track line arranged on a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> in Skjeggedal in Odda, Hordaland, Norway. From the station close to the Ringedals Dam and the lake Vetlavatn, the funicular ascended 430 m to the top station Mågelitopp, 860 m above sea level. The Mågelibanen {{was part of an}} industrial landscape connected to the listed hydroelectric power station in Tyssedal and the industry in the city of Odda.|$|R

Hear the clatter as we pass the semaphores and switch lights! We must be close in now! ...|$|R

500|$|Shortly after {{entering}} New Paltz, the trail crosses a bridge over Plattekill Creek. The masonry for {{the bridge was}} completed by late June 1870, and <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> was done by July. Originally made of wood, the bridge was accidentally set on fire in 1880 by ashes or sparks from a passing train. This prompted the railroad to coat its rail ties with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone. The bridge's original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate. It was rebuilt in 1912, and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of [...] The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Gitt also {{recommended}} a bridge crossing for the Monocacy river 30 feet above its bed, requiring a truss bridge with two spans of 150 feet each connecting to wooden <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> {{on the west}} shore of about 300 feet in length, and 15 feet high with masonry foundations up to the [...] "high water" [...] mark.(Gitt, page 43) Gitt also noted {{that some of the}} ravine crossings would be replaced with embankments within ten to twelve years. Bridge spans were required for Big Pipe Creek (100 feet), Little Pipe Creek and Antietam required spans of 80-90 feet and 60 feet for Owings Creek.(Gitt, page 44) ...|$|R

5000|$|Bracut (formerly, Brainard) is an unincorporated {{community}} in Humboldt County, California. It {{is located on}} the Northwestern Pacific Railroad 3 mi south of Arcata, at an elevation of 16 feet (5 m). The name originated as a contraction of the railway cut through Brainard hill in the Humboldt Bay salt marsh. Railway <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> originally connected the hill south to Eureka and north to Arcata. Much of the hill was subsequently excavated to provide fill to replace the original trestle work; and the railway fill prism became a dike encouraging conversion of the inland salt marsh to pasture land. [...] The leveled hill is now the site of several large structures remaining from previous lumber operations, a District 1 CalTrans yard, and a KOA campground.|$|R
5000|$|The new station, {{which opened}} on 31 October 1938 (the earlier station closing {{permanently}} the previous night), {{was designed to}} be completely subterranean, providing a much-needed pedestrian underpass for the road above. However, in order to accommodate the space needed for this, and the platforms below, the existing track required lowering by more than seven feet. To achieve this task whilst still keeping the track open during the day, the bed underneath the track was excavated, and the track held up by a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>work.</b> Then, once excavation was complete and the new station constructed around the site, an army of over 900 workmen lowered the whole track simultaneously in one night, using overhead hooks to suspend the track when necessary. The hooks [...]|$|R
50|$|The Hurricane Canal is a hand-excavated {{irrigation}} canal that diverted {{water from the}} Virgin River to the vicinity of Hurricane, Utah. The 7.5 mi canal was built starting in 1891 and completed in 1904. The work included a diversion dam on the Virgin River, the 12 ft wide canal grade with an 8 ft wide by 4 ft deep channel, {{and a series of}} flumes and <b>trestles.</b> <b>Work</b> was done by local men, mainly between November and May. The work was paid for by the canal's shareholders, whose lands on the Hurricane Bench were to be irrigated by the canal. Allotments were limited to 20 acre for shareholder. The 2000 acre of new agricultural lands allowed the settlement of Hurricane after 1906.|$|R
