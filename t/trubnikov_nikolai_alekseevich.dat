5000|$|Although {{the younger}} {{members of the}} family rarely {{attended}} Divine Liturgy, the Abrikosovs regarded themselves as pillars of the Russian Orthodox Church. Anna's parents died early: her mother while giving birth to her, and her father ten days later, of tuberculosis. Anna and her four brothers were raised in the house and provincial estate of her uncle, <b>Nikolai</b> <b>Alekseevich</b> Abrikosov.|$|R
50|$|Sergei {{is perhaps}} best known for a series of {{photographs}} of famous artists, writers and public figures (included among these notable figures were Nikolai Nekrasov, Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov, Vladimir Sollogub, Fedor Tyutchev, Peter Vyazemsky, Alexander Strugovshchikov, Vasily Botkin, Ivan Panaev, Pavel Annenkov, Dmitry Grigorovich, Alexander Herzen, Sergey Volkonsky, and Leo Tolstoy). It is perhaps this association that led <b>Nikolai</b> <b>Alekseevich</b> Nekrasov (1821-1878) to purchase a painting by Rafail Levitsky that hangs {{in the living room of}} the N.A. Nekrasov Apartment Museum to this day.|$|R

Pushkin is {{particularly}} important, as his short story [...] "The Queen of Spades" [...] (1833) was adapted into operas and movies by both Russian and foreign artists. Some parts of Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov's [...] "A Hero of Our Time" [...] (1840) are also considered to {{belong in the}} gothic genre, but they lack the supernatural elements of the other Russian gothic stories.|$|R
50|$|First {{described}} by <b>Nikolai</b> <b>Alekseevich</b> Severtzov in 1850, the Levant sparrowhawk {{is a small}} bird of prey in the genus Accipiter. It is sometimes {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the shikra, though it differs in measurements, proportions and plumage, and breeds contiguously with the latter (typically considered a reliable indicator of speciation) over at least part of its range. Along with the shikra, the Chinese sparrowhawk and the Nicobar sparrowhawk, it makes up a complex species group. It is known to have hybridised with the shikra and the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Despite its extensive range, it has no subspecies.|$|R
