5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|The National is a Scottish daily {{newspaper}} owned by Newsquest that began publication on 24 November 2014, {{and the first}} {{daily newspaper}} in Scotland to support Scottish independence. Launched as a response <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> from Newsquest's readership for a pro-independence paper {{in the wake of}} the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, it is a sister paper of The Herald and the Sunday Herald, and is edited by Callum Baird. Initially published on weekdays, a Saturday edition was added in May 2015. The National is printed in tabloid format, and is also available via online subscription.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims {{and the way in which}} they were presented.|$|E
5|$|The team's first {{exhibition}} game, a 7-0 {{defeat for}} the Flyers against the McGill Redmen, led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for the squad being scrapped {{and replaced with}} collegiate players.

5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|C. c. perplexus, {{the western}} subspecies, occurs {{from the head}} of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its {{northern}} limits are Shark Bay and the mulga-eucalypt boundary line. It is less specialised in its habitat, as it does not share its distribution with the little raven, and does not appear to correlate with the range of sheep. The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies, with similarities <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise no difference in plumage. Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Despite U.S. {{declarations}} of neutrality and German accountability for its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program {{over three years}} for 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more important, {{because they had to}} handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the war}} 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the city}} gained {{autonomy}} from county council control as a unitary authority area, but {{it continues to}} form part of Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes. Policing in the city remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The police authority comprises 17 members, including nine councillors, of which seven are nominated by Cambridgeshire county council and two are nominated by Peterborough city council. Firefighting remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service. The joint fire authority comprises 17 elected councillors, 13 from Cambridgeshire county council and four from Peterborough city council. Nowadays the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, one of few of its kind, effectively functions as a retained fire station, responding <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> as directed by Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service.|$|E

5|$|In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped {{organize}} a relief effort for the Texas town {{of the same}} name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> {{for action}} from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing {{that they would not}} accept the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Mora's death, the {{organization}} he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including {{a statement from the}} United Nations and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> for him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball.
