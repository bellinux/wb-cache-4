5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of {{traditional}} Japanese instruments in his music, and even took up playing the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting <b>these</b> <b>instruments</b> from such different musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable notational system for <b>these</b> <b>instruments,</b> which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of scientific instruments configured as wireless miniature robots capable of {{operations at the}} atomic scale may provide a solution for high throughput mechanosynthesis processes in nanotechnology. To this end, a nanofactory based on the coordinated work of a fleet of approximately 100 of <b>these</b> <b>instrumented</b> robots is being built. To achieve a high density of instruments and to increase both the throughput and {{the flexibility of the}} platform, the size of these high power robots has been decreased below the minimum size required to dissipate the heat when known heat dissipation methods are used. To deal with such a problem, this paper presents the design and implementation of a special fully integrated cooling chamber developed to cool a fleet of approximately 100 of <b>these</b> <b>instrumented</b> robots without increasing their overall size while minimizing thermal drifts on the sensitive instruments through the use of an Helium atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} two main instruments of economic diplomacy - regional integration and commercial diplomacy - on export flows among African states. We test whether there is any evidence of a trade-off or complementary interaction between <b>these</b> two <b>instruments</b> in trade facilitation. We compare the effects of <b>these</b> two <b>instruments</b> of economic diplomacy on bilateral trade by employing a gravity model for 45 African states over the period 1980 - 2005. The results show that bilateral diplomatic exchange is a relatively more significant determinant of bilateral exports among African states compared to regional integration. We also find a nuanced interaction between <b>these</b> two <b>instruments</b> of economic diplomacy: the trade-stimulating effect of diplomatic exchange is less pronounced among African countries that shared membership of the same regional bloc. Generally, this could mean that there exists a trade-off between regional integration and commercial diplomacy in facilitating exports {{or a lack of}} complementarity between <b>these</b> two <b>instruments</b> of economic diplomacy...|$|R

5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. <b>These</b> <b>instruments</b> eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus the harp for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, {{and it was so}} used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. <b>These</b> <b>instruments</b> were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and whips.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to <b>these</b> <b>instruments</b> is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E

5|$|The musicians at the {{sessions}} were recruited by Shambhu Das, who had assisted in Harrison's sitar tuition on his previous visit to Bombay, in 1966, and Vijay Dubey, {{the head of}} A for HMV Records in India. The line-up on the track was Aashish Khan (sarod), Mahapurush Misra (pakhavaj), Hanuman Jadev (shehnai), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri) and Rijram Desad (harmonium). In Lavezzoli's estimation, although <b>these</b> <b>instruments</b> are more commonly associated with the Hindustani discipline, the performers play them in a South Indian style, which adds to the Carnatic identity of the song. The recording features tabla tarang over the quiet, vocal interludes. Author Simon Leng refutes {{the presence of the}} oboe-like shehnai, however, saying that this part was played on an esraj, a bow-played string instrument. As with the Wonderwall selections recorded at HMV, Harrison directed the musicians but did not perform on the instrumental track.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of <b>these</b> <b>instruments</b> were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. <b>These</b> <b>instruments,</b> developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} {{modalities}} for making broadband phase-sensitive measurements at terahertz (THz) frequencies are vector network analyzers (VNA) and time-domain spectrometers (TDS). <b>These</b> measuring <b>instruments</b> have separate and fundamentally different operating principles and methodologies, and they serve very different application spaces.

5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud <b>these</b> <b>instruments</b> were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E
