Deficiency parts appear in binary images through extraction process because of noises in CLSM images. It is needed manual operation to compensate it.

Using this method, <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single neuron is represented by smooth curves, and it is reduced that the burden of manual extraction processes.

5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} context {{sensitive}} attacks, is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs {{a sequence of}} actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist.

While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars.
