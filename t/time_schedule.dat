Both series were {{produced}} and developed by William Asher and his partner Harry Ackerman for Ashmont Productions and Screen Gems, which had scored a major success for the network with Bewitched, a fantasy sitcom that first aired in 1964 starring Asher's wife, Elizabeth Montgomery. Asher and Screen Gems made a deal with ABC to cancel Bewitched a year earlier than contracts stipulated, thereby allowing them the opportunity to develop the two new sitcoms. Ackerman served as executive producer and Asher as producer.|$|E

25|$|When it {{came time}} for CBS to {{broadcast}} Game 6 of the 1980 Finals (on Friday, May 16), the network gave its affiliates the option of either airing the game live or on tape delay (in fact, WAGA-TV in Atlanta did not carry the NBA on CBS for numerous years). If the affiliate chose to air the game later that night, then the prime <b>time</b> <b>schedule</b> would consist of reruns of The Incredible Hulk, The Dukes of Hazzard and Dallas (CBS, NBC and ABC ended the 1979–80 seasons in late March and early April in anticipation of a strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which came to fruition in July 1980). The clinching Game 6 of the 1980 Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers was most notably, aired live in the Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle markets; CBS stations in the latter three markets were able to air the game live and still show most of the CBS prime <b>time</b> <b>schedule</b> since the game tipped at 6:00p.m. Pacific Time.

40|$|International audienceIn {{perspectives}} {{offered by}} multi-channel SDR set, digital signal processors (DSP) need to simultaneously execute several radio physical layer (PHY) components.

Designers of such DSP applications have resort to ad hoc methods and perform pre-runtime real <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> by hand. Since the complexity, due to the different combinatorial of waveforms, keeps growing, ad hoc and manual methods will prone to errors, time consuming and will often fail to find feasible schedule even when one exists.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of virtual <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> to the request admission mechanism used in the IEEE 802. 14 MAC protocol. For each contention minislot, arrivals within a certain interval are allowed to contend for transmission.

The virtual time is based on a mapping involving the unused contention minislots, and the frame length. It is shown through simulation that virtual <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> enhances the system performance and results in a close to FCFS strategy. In addition, through the differential handling of virtual clocks of the different user classes, virtual <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> can be used to implement prioritized access.

25|$|In 1970, ABC debuted Monday Night Football {{as part of}} its Monday {{prime time}} schedule; the program became a hit for the network and served as the National Football League (NFL)'s premier game of the week until 2006, when Sunday Night Football, which moved to NBC that year as part of a {{broadcast}} deal that in turn saw MNF move to ESPN, took over as the league's marquee game. According to Goldenson, Monday Night Football helped earn ABC regularly score an audience share of 15%–16%; ABC Sports managed the budget for the Monday night time slot to reallocate the weekly budget for ABC's prime <b>time</b> <b>schedule</b> to just six days, as opposed to seven on competing networks. 1970 also saw the premieres of several soap operas including the long-running All My Children, which ran on the network for 41 years.|$|E

Some programs (notably the defunct long-running erotic anthology Decisiones ("Decisions"), which the network now airs only in reruns), only include English captions in certain episodes, depending on when they were produced. Programs that use English captions are primarily consist of telenovelas, though a few shows outside the genre (such as the prime time court show Caso Cerrado: Edición Especial) are also transcribed in both languages. Availability of English subtitles is limited to the technical capacity of the local station, cable or satellite provider, or other outlet to disseminate them over the network feed.|$|E

We have arguments that it is not possible. Therefore we study UCTP with the assumption that each room belongs to exactly one type of room. A type of room is a set of rooms, which have similar properties. We prove that in this case UCTP is polynomially reducible to <b>time</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Hence we solve UCTP with the following method: at first we solve <b>time</b> <b>scheduling</b> and subsequently we solve space scheduling with a polynomial O(n 3) algorithm. In this way we obtain a radical (exponential) speed-up of algorithms for UCTP. The method was applied at P. J. Šafárik University...|$|R

The results indicate that while the use of work <b>time</b> <b>schedules</b> with moderate flexibility is positively related to technical efficiency, highly flexible work time arrangements seem to be negatively correlated with an efficient organization of the work flow.

25|$|KTVU officially joined Fox {{seven months}} later on October 9, 1986, when the fledgling network inaugurated {{programming}} with the debut of the late night talk show The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Similar to other Fox stations during the network's early years, KTVU was programmed as a de facto independent station, even after Fox expanded its programming into prime time on weekend evenings in April 1987. Until Fox completed the expansion of its prime <b>time</b> <b>schedule</b> (which began with the launch of a Saturday night lineup in July 1987, and was gradually rolled out to additional nights {{over the next seven}} years) and began offering programming on a nightly basis in September 1993, KTVU continued to air a movie at 8:00p.m. on nights when the network did not offer any programming. However, the station also decreased its reliance on movies during this period, due to the growing difficulty of broadcast stations in acquiring film content as the number of cable television networks increased. The strong ratings that KTVU had as an independent station carried over into its tenure with Fox, turning it into one of the network's strongest affiliates; despite having its programming occasionally being pre-empted by San Francisco Giants game telecasts, Fox was very satisfied with KTVU because of its ratings performance.|$|E
