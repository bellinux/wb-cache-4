5|$|Each {{successive}} volcano spends {{less time}} actively {{attached to the}} plume. The large difference between <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>and</b> oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot's velocity is increasing. For example, Kohala, the oldest volcano on Hawaii island, is one million years old and last erupted 120,000 years ago, a period of just under 900,000 years; whereas one of the oldest, Detroit Seamount, experienced 18 million {{or more years of}} volcanic activity.|$|E

By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image {{in the study of the}} early universe.|$|E

In particular, Woods was {{instrumental}} in the construction and then utilization of geiger counters for analysis during experimentation. She was the only woman present when the reactor went critical. She worked with Fermi on the Manhattan Project, and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of xenon poisoning at the Hanford plutonium production site, and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford's plutonium production reactors.|$|E

She met Herbert Anderson, who was working for Enrico Fermi. The two would go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, {{and as soon as}} her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux.|$|E

At age five, his father left for a holiday in Cape Verde but never returned, and when he was 12 years old, his mother left Portugal {{to start a new life}} in the Netherlands. Nani has nine siblings from his mother, of which he is <b>the</b> <b>youngest,</b> <b>and</b> five from his father. Nani gained his nickname from an elder sister at a young age.|$|E
5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan robes, and interacted more closely with the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>and</b> most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{infantry}} of the maniples {{were supported}} {{by a number of}} light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed {{to the rear of the}} third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>and</b> lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.|$|E

5|$|On 4 April 1940, Robertson {{joined the}} Second AIF himself, with {{the rank of}} brigadier, and was {{allocated}} the AIF service number VX20321. He was appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade, which was then being formed from units made surplus by {{the reduction of the}} 6th Division from 12 infantry battalions to nine. All three of its battalions, the 2/4th, 2/8th and 2/11th Infantry Battalions, were initially commanded by over-age officers, but the commander of the 2/4th was replaced by Ivan Dougherty in August. Initially, Dougherty received a cool reception from Robertson, who was disappointed at being unable to select his own battalion commanders, but Dougherty soon made such a good impression that when Robertson went on leave in October 1940 he recommended that Dougherty act as brigade commander, {{despite the fact that he}} was <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>and</b> most junior of Robertson's battalion chiefs.|$|E

5|$|The Skidi {{people of}} Native Americans saw {{the stars of}} Corona Borealis {{representing}} a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed their messages to the gods, {{as well as how}} chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters, who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>and</b> most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her. They married though she later returned to the sky, with her heartbroken husband and son following later. The Mi'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as Mskegwǒm, the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).|$|E
5|$|Velites were <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>and</b> {{usually the}} poorest (being 5th class citizens, with {{property}} worth 4002,500 denarii) {{soldiers in the}} legion, and could rarely afford much equipment. They were armed with veretum, light javelins, each with a 90 cm (3 ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c. 10 in (25 cm) narrow metal point, and tips designed to bend on impact to prevent them being thrown back, similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries. Livy says that they each carried seven javelins, however Roman satirist Lucilius says that they carried five, suggesting that the amount may have changed.They also carried darts, 30 in long, which also had a tip {{that was designed to}} bend on impact. The hastati and principes carried gladii, relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres (29 inches) in length, as their main weapons, and the velites carried them as backup weapons. They fought in a very loose, staggered formation like most irregular troops, and carried small round shields called parma, 90cm (3feet) in diameter.|$|E
