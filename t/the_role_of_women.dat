Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many – including Mott – urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.|$|E

5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. <b>The</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in {{the defeat of the}} Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union.

40|$|Explorations <b>of</b> womens <b>roles</b> in armed {{conflict}} have traditionally focused on women as victims, {{which has led}} to a limited understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active <b>roles</b> <b>women</b> have played during and after conflicts. For example, analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in <b>the</b> 1994 Rwanda genocide have largely focused on the victimization <b>of</b> <b>women</b> through rapes and mutilations, which leaves many dimensions unexplored. Exposing <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in perpetrating violence or reconciliation efforts can contribute to a more nuanced understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in wartime and challenge the traditional gender stereotypes that have denied womens agency dealing with the aftermath of conflict. This study aims to contribute to the literature on women and conflict, specifically ethnic conflict, by providing a broader and thus more accurate picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> during and after the Rwanda genocide. This study explores the following question: What roles did Rwandan women play in the genocide and are women revealing their agency and abilities in the aftermath? This thesis explores the gendered nature of the Rwanda genocide as revealed in the violence committed against women and by women during the Rwanda genocide (women as victims and perpetrators), as well as the position <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in post-genocide Rwanda (their agency in reconciliation and reconstruction). This research represents a qualitative study based on information provided by news sources, ethnic conflict and genocide literature, feminist literature, reports by non-governmental organizations, and international organizations including the United Nations (specifically the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda) and the World Bank. <b>The</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> during and after conflict have been traditionally understood from a biased perspective; however, the genocide in Rwanda has revealed the great extent to which women are affected by conflict, participate in conflict, and contribute to reconstruction and reconciliation efforts.

5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities and <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were {{often at the}} forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|The war {{affected}} Australia in many ways, although arguably not as greatly {{as it did}} {{the many}} European nations that were more directly involved. Economically the war {{had a number of}} significant impacts, although the Great Depression would later prove far more significant and Australian industry was not as greatly transformed as it would be following World War II. The political landscape was also transformed due to the rifts that resulted from the issue of conscription, while to a smaller extent <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in society also evolved as more women entered the workforce. Indeed, between 1914 and 1918 there had been a 13 per cent increase in the employment of women; however, this was mainly in areas were women were traditionally employed. Equally, although around 2,000 women were employed as nurses in the AIF, there was no great involvement of women in the military during the war.|$|E
