5|$|Just as the 1630s replica {{has proven}} to be an {{accurate}} copy of the lost original, <b>the</b> <b>panorama</b> {{has proven to}} be a surprisingly reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm. The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E

In the {{foreground}} is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E

In the first place, we are going to briefly explain the Visorama, a {{multimedia}} and virtual reality system, developed by The school of Communication in partnership with The Pure and Applied Mathematics Institute. In the second place, we are going to analyse the case of <b>the</b> <b>panoramas,</b> first mass media image devices to offer a total immersiveness, still in the 18 th century. In the third place, we intend to demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>panoramas</b> are related to a major disruption in the “scope” order that happened in the passage from the 18 th to the 19 th century. That order placed the visual experience in the autonomous viewer’s body. <b>The</b> <b>panoramas</b> break up with a certain historic vision: technological evolutionism and modernity as, above all, transformation that, by bringing the spectator to the centre, disrupts the image as a representation...|$|R

25|$|Plaxton {{launched}} a new design - <b>the</b> <b>Panorama</b> Elite - at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show in London. This essentially set the basic design of British coaches for the next 14 years. The design was stylish, with long sleek lines and gentle curve in the vertical plane. The windows were gasket glazed and the glass gently curved in the vertical plane to suit the body curve. The rear again used the large soup plate lights of <b>the</b> <b>Panorama</b> I, and the front grill was also from <b>the</b> <b>Panorama</b> I.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>panorama</b> {{was created}} by 13Russian and Bulgarian artists and was {{constructed}} {{in honor of the}} 100th anniversary of the Pleven Epopee and was officially unveiled on 10 December 1977. <b>The</b> <b>panorama</b> expanded the already existing Skobelev Park, which is located on the site where three of the four major battles which led to the liberation of Bulgaria took place. In the first three years after its opening, 2.5million people visited <b>the</b> <b>panorama.</b> The monument is one of nearly 200 built by the people of Pleven in tribute to the battle and to the nearly 35,000lives lost.|$|E

25|$|The major {{competitor}} for <b>the</b> <b>Panorama</b> Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel {{design and}} built at Duple's Blackpool factory. The Dominant had {{many of the}} design cues of <b>the</b> <b>Panorama</b> Elite {{and that could be}} because the managing director at that time was an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E

40|$|The {{surveys of}} the {{interior}} of two churches in Italy, the Magdalene’s church in Pesaro, and San Dominic church in Arezzo, are shown and described as examples of a new photogrammetric technique. The first church {{is one of the}} most noticeable baroque architecture in the Marche region and it has been designed by the famous architect Luigi Vanvitelli in 18 th century, the second one is a large and simple church in Arezzo. The proposed technique is based on <b>the</b> multi-image spherical <b>panoramas.</b> For <b>the</b> formation of the plane image of <b>the</b> spherical <b>panoramas</b> <b>the</b> commercial software has been used. <b>The</b> spherical <b>panorama</b> can be regarded as the analogical recording of the angular observations of a theodolite having its center in <b>the</b> center of <b>panorama.</b> But to be set in operational conditions as a theodolite, <b>the</b> spherical <b>panorama</b> has to recover two rotation angles to set the verticality of its principal axis. The estimation of such rotation angles can be performed both in a preliminary phase prior to the plotting or in a unique phase in a block adjustment. Control points, control directions, geometric constraints such as verticality and horizontality of space lines, can be used. In these study-cases almost no one of such control information was necessary, but the only block adjustment was sufficient. The block adjustment finally furnishes the estimation of the unknown points coordinates together with the six orientation parameters per panorama, three translations and three rotations, by means of the known geodetic equations of the horizontal direction and the zenith angle, (modified to take into account the two horizontal correction angles), that are nothing else than the collinearity equations of <b>the</b> spherical <b>panoramas.</b> <b>The</b> technique of <b>the</b> spherical <b>panoramas</b> has previously been experimented and used for the survey o...|$|R
