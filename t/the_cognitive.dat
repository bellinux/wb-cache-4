5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers.

5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and may lead to <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> decline seen early in AD.|$|E

3000|$|It {{has been}} claimed that <b>the</b> limited <b>cognitive</b> {{resources}} of humans means that instructional methods must be designed carefully {{to ensure that}} learners are able to utilize their cognitive resources efficiently. There are three types of cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Intrinsic cognitive load is created by the complexity of materials [3, 4]. The more complex information is, <b>the</b> more intrinsic <b>cognitive</b> load a learner experiences. Unrelated activities or the inappropriate presentation of materials can hinder learning and generate extraneous cognitive load. As long as materials and learning goals remain constant, <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>cognitive</b> load will remain fixed. Changing an instructional procedure can alter <b>the</b> extraneous <b>cognitive</b> load on learners. Germane cognitive load {{is defined as the}} amount of human cognitive resources devoted to <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>cognitive</b> load and is highly related to the learner’s motivation and level of engagement in learning. Germane cognitive load is associated only with the instructional designs that increase the use of the working-memory resources to reduce intrinsic <b>cognitive</b> load during <b>the</b> learning process [9].|$|R

It {{is important to recognize}} these deficits, and their impact on daily activities, at an early stage so people can get the support they need.

Method: Twenty-nine people with mild stroke were recruited for this cross-sectional study.

Findings: <b>The</b> Montreal <b>Cognitive</b> Assessment cut-off did not identify those who might experience problems in daily functioning after mild stroke.
