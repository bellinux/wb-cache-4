This paper presents {{the design and}} development of an automated pipette puller system for fabrication of glass micropipettes. The pipette puller employs a new strategy for fabrication of micropipettes that enables achieving independent control of their taper, tip diameter, and bend-angle, and also facilitates theoretical derivation of simple, approximate relationships between the pipette shape and the pulling parameters. Subsequently, the design and fabrication of the pipette puller is described, which include that of the pipette heating system, the mechanical motion stages, and the control electronics of the pipette puller. The fabricated pipette puller is experimentally evaluated to demonstrate control of the taper, tip diameter, and the bend-angle of the micropipette. Further, the dependence of the taper and tip diameter on the pulling parameters is evaluated and is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>alignment</b> with the proposed theoretical relationships.

40|$|Identifying {{recombinant}} sequences {{in an era}} {{of large}} genomic databases is challenging as it requires an efficient algorithm to identify candidate recombinants and parents, as well as appropriate statistical methods to correct for the large number of comparisons performed. In 2007, a computation was introduced for an exact nonparametric mosaicism statistic that gave high-precision p-values for putative recombinants. This exact computation meant that multiple-comparisons corrected p-values also had high precision, which is crucial when performing millions or billions of tests in large databases. Here, we introduce an improvement to the algorithmic complexity of this computation from O(mn 3) to O(mn 2), where m and n are the numbers of recombination-informative sites in the candidate recombinant.

However, the pattern of these distortions remained debatable. The {{aim of this study}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> estimate the geometry of the visual representation of space in hemianopia using an auditory marker. Method: Patients with pure left or right hemianopia (without neglect) <b>were</b> tested <b>in</b> tasks requiring them to bring a visual stimulus into spatial alignment with a target sound (Experiment 1) or vice versa (Experiment 2). Results: In Experiment 1, patients adjusted the location of a light such that it was displaced toward the anopic side with reference to the physical sound position. In Experiment 2, patients adjusted the location of a sound such that it <b>was</b> displaced opposite <b>to</b> the anopic side with reference to the actual position of the visual target.

Conclusions: Given that auditory localization in patients with hemianopia has <b>been</b> previously shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only slightly biased toward the anopic side, the observed distortion of visual space with reference to auditory space can be explained by assuming that visual positions <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> absolute terms, perceived as shifted toward the intact side.
