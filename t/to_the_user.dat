40|$|OSMOS- 7 is an {{application}} that can create and filter MPEG- 7 semantic content models {{with regards to}} objects and events, both spatially and temporally. The results are presented as numerous video segments that are all relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user's</b> consumption criteria, yet these results are not ranked according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user's</b> preferences. Using self organizing networks (SONNs) we rank <b>the</b> segments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user's</b> preferences by applying the knowledge gained from similar users' experience and use content similarity for new segments to derive a relative ranking. <b>To</b> bridge <b>the</b> gap between <b>the</b> <b>user</b> preferences and <b>the</b> content model, an MPEG- 7 model is proposed that uses the hanging basket model <b>to</b> better relate <b>the</b> <b>users</b> 'preferences and usage history <b>to</b> <b>the</b> content...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> sequentially, became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science.

5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E

5|$|The British Library's {{commercial}} secure electronic delivery {{service was}} started in 2003 {{at a cost of}} £6 million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of copyright restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to try to prevent further losses.|$|E
5|$|The content, organization, and {{updating}} of {{the vocabulary}} on an SGD {{is influenced by}} a number of factors, such at the user's needs and the contexts that the device will be used in. The development of techniques to improve the available vocabulary and rate of speech production is an active research area. Vocabulary items should be of high interest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> be frequently applicable, have a range of meanings, and be pragmatic in functionality.|$|E
5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Section 2, the intra-cluster {{interference}} can be completely eliminated by joint transmission {{as long as}} |S(c, n)| ≤ B.

5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E

5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E
5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
