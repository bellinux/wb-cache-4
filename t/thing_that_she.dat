25|$|This thought {{experiment}} has two purposes. First, it {{is intended}} to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since {{there is a difference between}} a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.|$|E
25|$|Julia is the {{catalyst}} of the play. While {{the other characters}} either hide their emotions in alcohol or avoid confrontations by smothering their feelings in banal social sweet talk, Julia brings matters to the forefront. She has wants, and she demands that they be at least heard, if not satisfied. The most obvious <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wants in this play is her bedroom in her parent’s home. However, upon her return, she discovers that her room is being occupied by Edna and Harry, her parents’ so-called best friends. In her attempts {{to regain control of}} her bedroom, Julia makes everyone confront the issues of the play, namely, defining relationships, wants, needs, and rights. At one point, Julia forces the issue first by having an emotional tantrum, then by upsetting the furniture and all the clothes in her bedroom, and finally by threatening everyone with a gun.|$|E

25|$|Nina soon revived {{her role}} as an assassin, the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{recalled}} from her previous life. Two years later, she was contracted by a Mafia syndicate to kill a famous British boxer, Steve Fox. However, she discovered that Steve was in fact her biological son, who was born through In vitro fertilisation during her years in cryosleep, with her gene is being used for Doctor Abel's Hybrid Gene experiment on children, including Steve, until the experiment was cancelled when most of children died during that experiment, except Steve {{and one of the}} surviving children, whose statuses are covered by the former Zaibatsu now G Corporation researcher Emma Kliesen (Leo's mother) from being watched by the Zaibatsu's eyes. At the last moment when she tried to pull the trigger to her rifle, she somehow and rarely regained her human emotions, and refused to kill Fox. she abandoned her assassination attempt after detective Lei Wulong brought down the syndicate. After the collapse of her employers, Nina no longer required a viable reason to pursue her target. It was also revealed that she remained emotionally impassive about the discovery of her biological son, but the fact that she did not kill him when the chance presented itself shows otherwise for some.|$|E

Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> once did, blaming herself {{for not being able}} to control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered what got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks.

[...] "He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts," [...] explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: [...] "I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could sleep with and put over her face," [...] Johnston notes. [...] "That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times." [...] Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, [...] "They're more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface," [...] Johnston says.|$|E

500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{press conference}} in Athens after the final, Kalomoira said that [...] "it was an honor... to {{represent}} Greece in this contest" [...] and thanked Greece because they supported her from the first moment she said she would compete. However, she reported later that she had returned to the United States because she felt mistreated by her record label and was not paid for several arrangements she had made with Heaven during her stay in Belgrade and had to pay for many things herself. In an interview with Downtown Magazine, Kalomoira's father stated that she was treated [...] "like dirt" [...] by Heaven Music and that she may or may not continue her singing career, but that it was up to her. In response, Makis Pounetzis, the new CEO of Heaven Music, claimed that he was [...] "surprised" [...] by Kalomoira's remarks and couldn't offer an explanation, though he did say that her contract would be honored should she choose to go back and sing again. Kalomoira returned to Greece in January 2009, and in an interview with Eleni Menegaki, she said that her Eurovision participation was the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has done in her career, and that it {{was also one of the}} most personal events in her life that will always be remembered with good memories. [...] When asked if she expected to do so well in the competition, she stated that she had always wanted to do well, but above all she wanted the Greek people to be proud of the performance regardless of how well it did. [...] In the same interview, host Eleni Menegaki stated that many, including herself, viewed Eurovision as a defining point in Kalomoira's career to date: her mature professional performance distanced her from the innocent little girl image associated with her participation in Fame Story.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{upon her}} work in the United States, Adler found that the pagan {{movement}} was [...] "very diverse" [...] in its class and ethnic background. She went on to remark that she had encountered pagans in jobs that ranged from [...] "fireman to PhD chemist" [...] but that the one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thought made them into an [...] "elite" [...] was as avid readers, something that she found to be very common within the pagan community {{despite the fact that}} avid readers constituted less than 20% of the general population of the United States at the time. Magliocco came to a somewhat different conclusion based upon her ethnographic research of pagans in California, remarking that the majority were [...] "white, middle-class, well-educated urbanites" [...] but that they were united in finding [...] "artistic inspiration" [...] within [...] "folk and indigenous spiritual traditions".|$|E

Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm {{going to end up}} doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song. It just seems like it was just speaking to me. Give it to me, give it to me.' I was like, 'Man cool, you can have it." ...|$|E
