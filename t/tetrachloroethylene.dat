5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} {{acetic acid}} from inorganic compounds {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> {{exposure}} can {{be evaluated}} by a breath test, analogous to breath-alcohol measurements. Because it {{is stored in}} the body's fat and slowly released into the bloodstream, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> can be detected in the breath for weeks following a heavy exposure. <b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a breakdown product of <b>tetrachloroethylene,</b> can be detected in the blood.|$|E
25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> as a Group 2A carcinogen, {{which means}} {{that it is probably}} carcinogenic to humans. Like many chlorinated hydrocarbons, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> is a central nervous system depressant and can enter the body through respiratory or dermal exposure. <b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> dissolves fats from the skin, potentially resulting in skin irritation.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} can be catalyzed by {{a variety}} of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> are collected together and then separated by distillation.|$|E
25|$|Michael Faraday first {{synthesized}} <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> in 1821 by {{thermal decomposition}} of hexachloroethane.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has {{compiled}} extensive {{health and safety}} information for <b>tetrachloroethylene,</b> including recommendations for dry cleaning establishments.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) {{recommends}} for <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> {{an occupational}} exposure limit (8 hour time-weighted average) of 20 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 40 ppm.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} {{been used as a}} dry {{cleaning}} solvent, although replaced in the 1950s by <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> (also known as perchloroethylene), except for spot cleaning where it was used until the year 2000.|$|E
25|$|Early {{treatment}} {{relied on}} the use of Epsom salt to reduce protective mucus, followed by thymol to kill the worms. Later <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> was the leading method. It was not until later in the mid-20th century when new organic drug compounds were developed.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is a {{versatile}} solvent, miscible {{with water and}} with many organic solvents, including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and toluene. It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and <b>tetrachloroethylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning and fatalities {{are often}} caused by faulty vents and chimneys, {{or by the}} burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent. Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly-adjusted pilot lights. Traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer gas and hydrogen sulfide, out of interiors. Clothing emits <b>tetrachloroethylene,</b> or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after dry cleaning.|$|E
25|$|Many {{chemicals}} undergo reactive decay {{or chemical}} change, especially {{over long periods}} of time in groundwater reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene (used in industrial metal degreasing and electronics manufacturing) and <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> used in the dry cleaning industry. Both of these chemicals, which are carcinogens themselves, undergo partial decomposition reactions, leading to new hazardous chemicals (including dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride).|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} capable of decomposing {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) as well, such as organochlorides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Species such as Suillus variegatus and Paxillus involutus were able to mineralize 2,4-dichlorophenol both in axenic culture and in an EcM association with Pinus sylvestris. The intact rhizosphere of Pinus taeda also exhibited the capacity to mineralize <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> under natural conditions. The EcM fungi Radiigera atrogleba and Hysterangium garneri were capable of decomposing up to 80% of a particular PCB when tested.|$|E
25|$|In {{the carbon}} {{tetrachloride}} molecule, four chlorine atoms are positioned symmetrically as corners in a tetrahedral configuration joined {{to a central}} carbon atom by single covalent bonds. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl4 is non-polar. Methane gas has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a halomethane. As a solvent, it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve iodine. It is somewhat volatile, giving off vapors with a smell characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> smell reminiscent of dry cleaners' shops.|$|E
25|$|For {{over twenty}} years of operation, RCA Corporation had been pouring toxic {{wastewater}} into a well in its Taoyuan City, Taiwan facility. The pollution from the plant was not revealed until 1994, when former workers brought it to light. Investigation by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration confirmed that RCA had been dumping chlorinated organic solvents into a secret well and caused contamination to the soil and groundwater surrounding the plant site. High levels of TCE and <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> (PCE) {{can be found in}} groundwater drawn as far as two kilometers from the site. An organization of former RCA employees reports 1375 cancer cases, 216 cancer deaths, and 102 cases of various tumors among its members.|$|E
25|$|It {{once was}} a popular solvent in organic chemistry, but, because of its adverse health effects, it is rarely used today. It is {{sometimes}} useful as a solvent for infrared spectroscopy, {{because there are no}} significant absorption bands > 1600cm−1. Because carbon tetrachloride does not have any hydrogen atoms, it was historically used in proton NMR spectroscopy. In addition to being toxic, its dissolving power is low. Its use has been largely superseded by deuterated solvents. Use of carbon tetrachloride in determination of oil has been replaced by various other solvents, such as <b>tetrachloroethylene.</b> Because it has no C-H bonds, carbon tetrachloride does not easily undergo free-radical reactions. It is a useful solvent for halogenations either by the elemental halogen or by a halogenation reagent such as N-bromosuccinimide (these conditions are known as Wohl-Ziegler Bromination).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> is {{a common}} soil contaminant. [...] With a {{specific}} gravity greater than 1, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> will be present as a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are released. Because of its mobility in groundwater, its toxicity at low levels, and its density (which causes it to sink below the water table), cleanup activities are more difficult than for oil spills (which has a specific gravity less than 1). [...] Recent {{research has focused on}} the in place remediation of soil and ground water pollution by <b>tetrachloroethylene.</b> [...] Instead of excavation or extraction for above-ground treatment or disposal, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> contamination has been successfully remediated by chemical treatment or bioremediation. [...] Bioremediation has been successful under anaerobic conditions by reductive dechlorination by Dehalococcoides sp. and under aerobic conditions by cometabolism by Pseudomonas sp. Partial degradation daughter products include trichloroethylene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride; full degradation converts <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> to ethene and hydrogen chloride dissolved in water.|$|E
2500|$|Animal {{studies and}} {{a study of}} 99 twins showed there is a [...] "lot of circumstantial evidence" [...] that {{exposure}} to <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> {{increases the risk of}} developing Parkinson's disease ninefold. Larger population studies are planned. Also, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> has been shown to cause liver tumors in mice and kidney tumors in male rats.|$|E
2500|$|At {{temperatures}} over , {{such as in}} welding, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> can be oxidized into phosgene, {{an extremely}} poisonous gas.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{other methods}} have been developed. [...] When 1,2-dichloroethane is heated to 400°C with chlorine, <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> is {{produced}} by the chemical reaction: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> [...] "is moderate to low". [...] "Reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> {{was once}} {{extensively}} {{used as an}} intermediate {{in the manufacture of}} HFC-134a and related refrigerants. [...] In the early 20th century, tetrachloroethene was used for the treatment for hookworm infestation.|$|E
2500|$|Most <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> is {{produced}} by high temperature chlorinolysis of light hydrocarbons. [...] The method is related to Faraday's discovery since hexachloroethane is generated and thermally decomposes. Side products include carbon tetrachloride, hydrogen chloride, and hexachlorobutadiene.|$|E
2500|$|According to a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{report of}} 1976, the {{quantity}} of <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> produced in the United States in 1973 totaled 320,000 metric tons (706 million lb). [...] By 1993, the volume produced in the United States had dropped to 123,000 metric tons (271 million lb).|$|E
2500|$|According to European regulation, {{the use of}} {{trichloroethylene}} {{is prohibited}} for individuals at a concentration greater than 0.1%. In industry, trichloroethylene should be substituted before April 21, 2016 (unless an exemption is requested before October 21, 2014) by other products such as <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> (perchloroethylene), methylene chloride (dichloromethane), or other hydrocarbon derivatives (ketones, alcohols, ...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Primary VOC {{pollutants}} {{found in}} groundwater include aromatic hydrocarbons such as BTEX compounds ( [...] benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), and chlorinated solvents including <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and vinyl chloride (VC). BTEX are important components of gasoline. PCE and TCE are industrial solvents historically used in dry cleaning processes {{and as a}} metal degreaser, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Maurice Crowther Hall {{ingested}} {{carbon tetrachloride}} to test its safety {{with a view}} to its possible use as a treatment for hookworm. [...] Hall reported mild side effects. [...] Carbon tetrachloride has since been found to cause acute liver failure. [...] In 1925, Hall ingested <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> (once the most common dry cleaning fluid) for the same purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Estimates {{state that}} 85% of <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> {{produced}} is {{released into the}} atmosphere; while models from OECD assumed that 90% is released {{into the air and}} 10% to water. Based on these models, its distribution in the environment is estimated to be in the air (76.39% - 99.69%), water (0.23% - 23.2%), soil (0.06-7%), with the remainder in the sediment and biota. Estimates of lifetime in the atmosphere vary, but a 1987 survey estimated the lifetime in the air to be about 2 months in the Southern Hemisphere and 5–6 months in the Northern Hemisphere. Degradation products observed in a laboratory include phosgene, trichloroacetyl chloride, hydrogen chloride, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. <b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> is degraded by hydrolysis, and is also persistent under [...] conditions. This compound is degraded by reductive dechlorination with anaerobic conditions present, with the degradation products such as trichloroethylene, dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene, and ethane.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tetrachloroethylene</b> is an {{excellent}} solvent for organic materials. [...] Otherwise it is volatile, highly stable, and nonflammable. For these reasons, it is widely used in dry cleaning. It {{is also used to}} degrease metal parts in the automotive and other metalworking industries, usually as a mixture with other chlorocarbons. It appears in a few consumer products including paint strippers and spot removers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tetrachloroethylene,</b> {{also known}} under the {{systematic}} name tetrachloroethene, or perchloroethylene ("perc" [...] or [...] "PERC"), [...] {{and many other}} names, is a chlorocarbon with the formula Cl2C=CCl2. It is a colorless liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics, hence it is sometimes called [...] "dry-cleaning fluid". It has a sweet odor detectable by most people at a concentration of 1 part per million (1 ppm). Worldwide production was about [...] in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|The {{products}} of chlorinolysis reactions heavily depend upon both {{the temperature and}} pressure under which the reaction occurs. Thus, by adjusting these reaction conditions {{in the presence of}} chlorine gas, hexachlorobutadiene can be even further chlorinated to give <b>tetrachloroethylene,</b> hexachloroethane, octachlorobutene, and even decachlorobutane. [...] In general, increasing the number of chlorine substituents on a compound increases its toxicity but decreases its combustibility. [...] Chlorination via carbon skeleton cleavage is thermodynamically preferred, whereas chlorinated C4 products are favored at lower temperatures and pressures. [...] The three chlorinolysis {{products of}} hexachlorobutadiene are shown in the reactions below.|$|E
2500|$|A solvent (from the Latin , [...] "loosen, untie, solve") is a {{substance}} that dissolves a solute (a chemically distinct liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid but {{can also be a}} solid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid. The quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent varies with temperature. Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning (e.g. <b>tetrachloroethylene),</b> as paint thinners (e.g. toluene, turpentine), as nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate), in spot removers (e.g. hexane, petrol ether), in detergents (citrus terpenes) and in perfumes (ethanol). Water is a solvent for polar molecules and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within a cell. Solvents find various applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, oil, and gas industries, including in chemical syntheses and purification processes.|$|E
2500|$|Located off Tyler Lane and Spring Valley Road on the Old Bridge Township border, {{the area}} of Burnt Fly Bog in Marlboro Township is listed as a Superfund {{clean-up}} site. It is a rural area covering approximately , {{most of it in}} Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. During the 1950s and early 1960s, many unlined lagoons were used for storage of waste oil. As a result, at least [...] of the bog have been contaminated. In addition to the current contaminated area, the site still consists of: an approximately 13,000-cubic-yard mound of sludge; and an undetermined number of exposed and buried drums. The site is a ground water discharge area for the Englishtown Aquifer. In this bog, ground water, surface water, and air are contaminated by oil and various organic chemicals.
