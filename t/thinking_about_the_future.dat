He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.|$|E

The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga. Air Productions, which produces the program Taratata, detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga's part. YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because we have received, several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show. She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance: [...] "Like the gentleman [...] just mentioned, that lantern means prosperity and it's about the future.

5000|$|Negotiations and persuasion {{are social}} {{conflicts}} {{can be understood}} in terms of CLT. When negotiating or trying to persuade someone, there are often major, high-level, considerations and minor, low-level, considerations. Major issues are aspects such as values, ideology, and overall beliefs. The major issues are often focused on to a greater extent when <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>future,</b> or with high-level construals. Minor issues are more specific interests that are focused on when <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> near <b>future,</b> or low-level construals. [...] CLT and persuasive communications are connected and interrelated in many aspects. When looking at negotiations in relation to high-level construal, there were multiple findings that have shown a difference between <b>the</b> <b>future</b> and <b>the</b> present. When people are more temporally distant or personally distant from an outcome, {{they are less likely to}} come to an easy conclusion or compromise over minor objectives. More distance between the present and the time when the negotiations take place makes people more willing to come to a joint conclusion and achieve logrolling agreements that maximize the outcomes of both parties. Lastly, <b>thinking</b> more abstractly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> negotiation in general leads to more compromises and mutually beneficial agreements.|$|R

The research vehicle is the socio-political context of the nations of the South China Sea. It is concluded that four main scenarios for that region can be developed and that these shed light on the region's problems.

Of all the tree genera in California, Quercus is the one most subjected to ecosystem change due to urbanization. Understanding the consequences for oaks begins with documentation of species composition change with urbanization (McBride and Jacobs 1986). From this description comes an understanding of functional changes such as shifts in water and chemical flux, fire, and disease processes. Our broader understanding of ecosystem change, in return, helps us to know whether, and how, we can sustain certain elements of that ecosystem such as native oaks. <b>Thinking</b> systemically <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of California oaks at large spatial and temporal scales helps us to see the problem in cumulative terms...|$|R
