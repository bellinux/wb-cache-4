Others state <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If {{you want to say}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for peace, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for righteousness.

25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain finally {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy on September 27, 1999 before {{a thousand people}} in Greeley Park in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying [...] "It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> candidate for president to the United States." [...] He further said he was staging [...] "a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests {{and return it to}} the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve." [...] As originally planned, he began his announcement day with a visit to the Naval Academy.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If {{you want to say}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice. Say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for peace. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|R

500|$|He {{released}} Diamond Dreams in 2008. The {{album was}} a collaboration with Kent Goodson, pianist for country star George Jones. It tells baseball stories inspired by West's umpiring career. Goodson later said, [...] "As I {{look back on}} how this CD came together, I realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> musician and Joe is an umpire. But his love for music and my love for baseball bonded us in this project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate." [...] Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was [...] "a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West." ...|$|E
500|$|Fidel Castro's {{religious}} beliefs {{have been a}} matter of some debate; he was baptized and raised a Roman Catholic, but he identified himself later in life as an atheist. He criticized use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans, but commented that Christianity exhibited [...] "a group of very humane precepts" [...] which gave the world [...] "ethical values" [...] and a [...] "sense of social justice", relating, [...] "If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Christian." [...] He was an exponent of the idea that Jesus Christ was a communist, citing the feeding of the 5,000 and the story of Jesus and the rich young man as evidence.|$|E

When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

500|$|Lambert's girth {{was then}} enormous; six men of normal size could fit {{together}} inside his waistcoat, {{and each of}} his stockings {{was the size of}} a sack. [...] His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. [...] Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to [...] "tell the gentleman <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> shy cock". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was [...] "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".|$|E
500|$|Maria was in poor health, and {{the couple}} moved to Philadelphia shortly after their marriage, {{thinking}} that her lungs could heal there. In Philadelphia, he became {{a contributing editor for}} the Pennsylvania Freeman, an abolitionist newspaper. In the spring of 1845, the Lowells returned to Cambridge to make their home at Elmwood. They had four children, though only one (Mabel, born 1847) survived past infancy. Blanche was born December 31, 1845, but lived only fifteen months; Rose, born in 1849, survived only a few months as well; their only son Walter was born in 1850 but died in 1852. Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children. His grief over the death of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem [...] "" [...] (1847). He again considered suicide, writing to a friend that he thought [...] "of my razors and my throat and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> fool and a coward not to end it all at once".|$|E

500|$|On 30 August 2013, Tasci {{moved to}} Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Upon leaving Stuttgart, he told the press, [...] "It {{was not an easy}} decision. The present decision is not a decision against VfB, but for the new task. I had an incredibly great time at VfB, have played in the youth here, then I turned pro and recently been the captain. I have always said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> VfBler and that I will remain." [...] Immediately after joining the club, his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks. He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training. After damaging his meniscus, Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation. He made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2–2 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala. He made three more appearances that season.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you must understand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E

500|$|Benjamin was {{the first}} U.S. senator to profess the Jewish faith. [...] In 1845, David Yulee, born David Levy, had been sworn in for Florida, but he renounced Judaism and {{eventually}} formally converted to Christianity. As an adult, Benjamin was a nonobservant Jew, {{who was not a}} member of a synagogue and took no part in communal affairs. [...] He rarely spoke of his religion publicly, but was not ashamed of it. Some of the stories told of Benjamin that touch on his faith come from Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who related that Benjamin delivered an address in a San Francisco synagogue on Yom Kippur in 1860, though whether this occurred is open to question as Wise was not there and it was not reported in the city's Jewish newspaper. One quote from Senate debate that remains [...] "part of the Benjamin legend", according to Evans, followed an allusion to Moses as a freer of slaves by a Northern senator, hinting that Benjamin was an [...] "Israelite in Egyptian clothing". Benjamin is supposed to have replied, [...] "It is true <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Jew, and when my ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate hand of deity, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain." ...|$|E
500|$|After making {{sporadic}} appearances, Wood {{was then}} announced to be returning for several episodes from December 12 to 20, 2013.

[...] Wood was also removed from the soap opera's opening credits. On December 4, 2014, Soap Opera Digest broke exclusive news that Wood would be returning to the series. At press time, Wood was scheduled for a [...] "handful" [...] of episodes, which began airing on January 30, 2015. Wood revealed that she agreed to return to the show after Bell had personally sent her a text message. Of her status with the series, the actress said [...] "if the timing is right, I'll always come back". In April 2015, Wood confirmed that she signed a contract deal with the series and would return in the role of Steffy. She made her on-screen return on May 26, 2015. Wood said: [...] "When I left the show , it wasn't a real goodbye", and mentioned that [...] "Brad sent me a text with an idea for a storyline. We both got really excited about it and that was it.

500|$|The Church of Scientology {{released}} a statement regarding the February 10, 2008 worldwide protests, which was published February 7, 2008 in the St. Petersburg Times. In the statement, the Church of Scientology called {{the organizers of the}} protests [...] "cyberterrorists", and stated: [...] "We take this seriously {{because of the nature of}} the threats this group has made publicly. We will take every step necessary to protect our parishioners and staff as well as members of the community, in coordination with the local authorities." [...] The statement also referred to the actions of members of Project Chanology as [...] "hate crimes" [...] and [...] "religious bigotry", and in a media release said that the group is guided by Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf; one of the organizers of the protest responded to the latter allegation by stating: [...] "I don't know where they got that from, but I don't think that's true considering <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> capitalist and a Jew". Pat Harney, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "We are dealing with a worldwide threat ... This is not a light matter." [...] In preparation for the February 10, 2008 protests outside Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, the Church of Scientology spent $4,500 to hire ten off-duty police officers for security. Clearwater Police Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Daly-Watts stated that the off-duty police officers will make sure that protesters do not trespass on Scientology property or violate the law, but will report to police supervisors and not representatives of the Church of Scientology.|$|E
