Most of Kitana's traditional special moves utilize her <b>twin</b> <b>fan</b> weapons, used as a melee weapon, as a thrown projectile, and to lift her enemies in the air.

40|$|This paper summarises the {{approach}} taken in establishing and validating the stall zone of a main axial fan for an underground expansion project. The expansion of an operating underground bord and pillar mine required {{the use of}} a second fan in parallel {{at the start of the}} development project. To improve the level of confidence in the ventilation simulation model that incorporated an existing fan curve provided by the fan supplier necessitated an independent fan test. Therefore, performance and stall characteristics of the current fan and pressure-quantity (PQ) survey of the mine was conducted and the results were used to calibrate the ventilation simulation model. The main axial fan was tested through a range of operating points beyond the currently perceived pressure stall point of 2. 1 kPa. A pitot traverse was conducted for two operating points and the remaining operating points were measured on fan instruments. This paper details the test procedures and instruments used to collect and analyse data, and the theory used in analysis and to calibrate fan differential pressure flow measurement instruments. The fan test study has validated the fan curves with different pitch setting for use in ventilation simulation studies with <b>twin</b> <b>fan</b> installations operating with the fan pitch set to 17. 5 º, which is to give a good operating safety margin from the stall zone of 2. 6 kPa...|$|E

50|$|Fox's career {{highlight}} {{may have}} come on July 29, 1992, when Fox hit a game-winning, three-run home run against the Minnesota Twins. That win put the A's into a first place tie with the Twins and catapulted them towards the American League West Division title that season, while the Twins finished in second place, six games back of the A's.

25|$|The stadium {{does not}} have a {{retractable}} roof, though one was considered initially. Such a roof was cited to add $100 million to the total budget and none of the parties (Twins, Hennepin County or Minnesota Legislature) were willing to pay for that cost. Much like other northern cities with outdoor professional baseball (i.e. Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Cleveland, New York), the weather in Minneapolis during a 162-game baseball season and playoffs can vary from early-spring snow to rain and hot, humid weather. The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many <b>Twins</b> <b>fans</b> and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, climate-controlled environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball.

5000|$|An {{important}} type of ballpark is {{the indoor}} park. These parks {{were covered with}} a fixed roof, usually a hard concrete dome. Reasons to build indoor parks were varied. The Astrodome, the first indoor sports stadium ever built, was built to escape the hot and very humid climate of Houston; the Kingdome was built to escape Seattle's constant rains, and the Sapporo Dome in Japan (which also hosts a soccer team) was built to escape Sapporo's extreme snowfall. There is little to no natural light in these parks, necessitating the use {{of one of the}} most distinguishing aspects of an indoor park: artificial turf. Since there was not enough light to grow grass, artificial turf was installed, and this affected the game. Artificial turf was harder, and thus a ball hit on the ground moved faster and bounced high. This, coupled with the usually dull white or gray roofs that could camouflage a fly ball, caused what <b>Twins</b> <b>fans</b> called a [...] "dome-field advantage".|$|R
5000|$|Victory Sports was {{slated to}} air 105 Twins games, {{with the other}} 57 airing on KSTC-TV. However, it was unable to obtain {{carriage}} from the primary cable television providers in the Twin Cities, {{the rest of the}} state of Minnesota, and the Dakotas, or from DirecTV or Dish Network. These providers balked at the $2.20-per-subscriber price that the Pohlads were demanding, which they felt was too much for a regional sports network. The cable companies were only willing to air it on a digital tier, but the Pohlads insisted that it air on basic cable. [...] It did, however, sign contracts with several smaller providers. [...] By April 2004, so few providers had signed on with the network that it was apparent it would never be viable. After a month in which only a tiny percentage of <b>Twins</b> <b>fans</b> could watch games locally, Victory Sports One signed off on May 8.
