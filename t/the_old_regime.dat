5|$|An era in {{the history}} of California closed yesterday. The Del Valles of Camulos bade {{farewell}} to the homestead where they have lived in successive generations since Antonio del Valle.

5|$|On {{the night}} of 27–28 February 1917, Michael {{attempted}} to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, {{where he had been}} in conference with Rodzianko and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regime.</b> Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less politically charged location. Michael himself took refuge in the apartment of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar's Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in the house next door General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.|$|E
50|$|This chapter {{highlights}} <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> in crisis, such as France, China, and Russia. These states set <b>the</b> {{precedent for}} <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> in crisis {{and help to}} outline pre-revolutionary conditions and the leading causes. Skocpol’s states that revolutionary crisis are created when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> fail to modernize with the evolving international situation (Skocpol 1979, 48). The reason that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> were in crisis was because the upper classes could not defend against peasant rebellions on a local basis; therefore, they supervise society to maintain order (Skocpol 1979, 48). The landed upper class relied on the monarchical class to bolster their status, prerogatives, and they built their fortune on state services to have such opportunities (Skocpol 1979, 49). Thus, the economic interests of the landed upper classes were in part obstacles to be overcome. These states were caught in a tough situation where the state decided to update their status {{in the international arena}} or fix the domestic class structure among {{the rich and the poor}} (Skocpol 1979, 50).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{economic}} historians have shown that in the century prior to the great Revolution the French economy was not stagnant. Although the economy {{may not have been}} as buoyant as that of Britain, it was not economic catastrophe that prompted <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Regime’s</b> political demise. <b>The</b> rehabilitation of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Regime’s</b> economy has largely been the work of historians and economists working on particular sectors or particular problems. In their efforts, they have relied upon a cornucopia of archival material and the tools of microeconomics. But there has been no effort to take advantage of advances in macroeconomics to rethink how the French economy changed over the eighteenth century. Guillaume Daudin makes just such an attempt in Commerce et prospérité...|$|R
5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regime,</b> which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1249, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was slain by {{a knight}} {{who appears to}} have been an {{accomplice}} of Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Immediately following the assassination, Haraldr Guðrøðarson first appears in the mediaeval Chronicle of Mann, the main historical source for the Crovan dynasty, when it records that he took control of the island-kingdom and replaced the chieftains of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> with followers of his own choosing. Although he was recognised as the legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England at first, he was later summoned to Norway by Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway, for his seizure of the kingdom. Upon his removal from Mann, Haraldr Guðrøðarson is not heard from again. In his absence, Magnús Óláfsson, yet another son of Óláfr, unsuccessfully attempted to seize Mann with Hebridean and Norwegian military support. The leadership of the Manx defenders in this action may have been adherents to Haraldr Guðrøðarson's cause. Even so, Magnús returned two years later and succeeded to the kingship, becoming the last of the sea-kings of the Crovan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regime,</b> lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E

25|$|Symbolism was {{a device}} to {{distinguish}} the main features of the Revolution and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate {{the differences between the}} new Republic and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regime,</b> the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regime</b> were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.|$|E

The absorption of these "country" in larger groups did not abolish representation structures (assemblies of states, diets, Cortes) in which the noble body flourished as "representatives babies' territories being of provincialism. This book examines the role that the European nobility played in the phenomena of resistance and renewal of intermediate powers under <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regimes.</b> It extends <b>the</b> discussion beyond 1789 to understand how, in France, the nobility has adapted to the changing territorial frameworks and centralization of power...|$|R

50|$|Some noncommunist {{accounts}} {{argue that}} various attacks on political repression under communist rule in anticommunist narratives {{should be more}} strongly contextualized. Academic specialists on social revolutions and Soviet development highlight continuities of political culture and social structure between communist <b>regimes</b> and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>regimes</b> they uprooted. From this view, as the Bolsheviks struggled against the White army and foreign armies during the civil war, they ensured the survival of their own regime by sweeping away the tsarist secret police {{and replacing it with}} a new political police, though of considerably greater dimensions. The new regime continued practices of censorship institutionalized under <b>the</b> <b>old</b> regime; indeed, <b>the</b> communists themselves had most often been the targets of this previous censorship.|$|R
