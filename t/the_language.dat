5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use of <b>the</b> <b>language.</b> Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Māori. The future of <b>the</b> <b>language</b> {{was the subject of a}} claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Māori was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of Māori people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in <b>the</b> <b>language.</b> There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori.

5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is <b>the</b> <b>language</b> as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire <b>the</b> <b>language</b> lost the standardizing influence of being <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E
