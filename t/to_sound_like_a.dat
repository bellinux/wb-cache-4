5|$|Designed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 1980s record, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was {{influenced}} by artists such as the Cure, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, R, hip hop, soul, and disco, while lyrically, most of its songs are about fashion and wealth. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour. While promoting, Stefani was often accompanied by back-up dancers called the Harajuku Girls.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, {{in an effort to}} replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin {{the difficult task of}} trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E

I want it <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> evolution. I want <b>to</b> explore more <b>sounds</b> and experiment a little bit. I have a bunch of ideas I'm very excited about and a lot of stuff cooking." [...] — Grande, on the album.|$|R

500|$|Gillan pays {{particular}} interest to the lyrics in Deep Purple, and considers it his prime composing role within the band. Discussing the importance of lyrics, he said [...] "Words have <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> good. They have <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> instrument, {{they have to have}} the right percussive value." [...] He described the words of 2003's Bananas as [...] "politics mostly." ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{also takes}} aim at small {{companies}} {{put out of}} business by giant corporations. Cool made an example out of record shops closing when a national retailer makes it to town. [...] "It's like there's just one voice you can hear," [...] he said. [...] "Not <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> preachy person, but it's getting towards the Big Brother of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four— except here you {{have two or three}} corporations running everything." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Durst {{announced}} that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. The press thought he was joking about this title. The album title is intended <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fictional band; the phrase [...] "Chocolate Starfish" [...] refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an [...] "asshole". Borland contributed {{the other half of}} the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.|$|E
5000|$|... “PoV has a {{lot more}} pure noise. We pleaded and pleaded with our label to let us release the album on 8 track format, but due to fears of poor sales to a music-buying public that had moved on into the digital era, they wouldn’t budge. So we {{recorded}} it <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> 8 track in all its hissy, tapy glory.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The song is {{influenced}} by different genres, like chillout, avant-garde and jazz. Since Björk wanted the album <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Indian soundtrack, many tracks including [...] "One Day", [...] "Come to Me" [...] and the same [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] features Indian instruments. The strings were accorded by Talvin Singh and recorded in Bombay. The track heavily uses Vibraphone.|$|R

[...] "I've done it before, but I thought, goddammit, you've got to be franker now, writing about love, but you don't want <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old man having his jollies." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{other members}} went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading factual books {{regarding}} serial killers, including Gordon Burn's Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West. Araya was seeking inspiration, and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gimmick. Araya sang the lyrics more [...] "over-the-top" [...] than done on previous albums, as King's writing style is more [...] "aggro." [...] This resulted in Kerrang! reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album's lyrics as [...] "so packed with foul and abusive language that {{it sounds as}} if D-12 and the Sopranos family were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hills of Radiant Wind" [...] {{is one of}} the few upbeat {{songs on}} the largely dark soundtrack; for that piece Evans sang in a version of Portuguese in a style meant <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spirit {{floating}} on the wind. For [...] "Grandma", she sang in a French style, trying to [...] "put in as much anguish and melancholy" [...] as possible; she created the song in a single recording, and it is [...] "one of the most memorable songs" [...] that she has sung. [...] "The Wretched Automatons" [...] is sung in a variant of English and was recorded prior to the addition of the mechanical sounds that run throughout the track, while [...] "Kainé" [...] is in a version of Gaelic.|$|E
500|$|The title {{song of the}} film, [...] "The Living Daylights", was co-written with Paul Waaktaar-Savoy of the Norwegian pop-music group A-ha and {{recorded}} by the band. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in {{two versions of the}} theme song. Barry's film mix is heard on the soundtrack (and on A-ha's later greatest hits album Headlines and Deadlines). The version preferred by the band can be heard on the 1988 A-ha album Stay on These Roads. However, in 2006 Paul Waaktaar-Savoy complimented Barry's contributions: [...] "I loved the stuff he added to the track, I mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement. That's when for me it started <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Bond thing". The title song {{is one of the few}} 007 title songs that is not performed or written by a British or American performer.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} from 2006, promoting The Road to Escondido, Clapton recalled {{that he was}} very happy making this album and was pleased with the results of the recording sessions, but also noted that [...] "the only thing he didn't like about the album is his voice", because it sounds so [...] "high" [...] and [...] "young", which Clapton disliked, because he [...] "always wanted <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old guy".|$|R
50|$|Orchestrion is {{a generic}} {{name for a}} machine that plays music and is {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> orchestra or band. Orchestrions may be operated {{by means of a}} large pinned cylinder or by a music roll and less commonly book music. The sound is usually produced by pipes, though they will be voiced differently from those found in a pipe organ, as well as percussion instruments. Many orchestrions contain a piano as well.|$|R
5000|$|Composer Jeff Lynne {{described}} {{writing the}} song in a 1990 radio interview with Roger Scott:"So Fine's a bouncy little (number). I really don't know much about it.

Maybe like The Doobie Brothers or something, y'know, trying <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> bit <b>like</b> <b>an</b> American group with harmonies.

500|$|Kieran Hebden, who is of Indian descent, {{acquired}} {{a collection of}} Hindu devotional music from his late grandfather when he {{was ten years old}} but had never listened to it. When his maternal grandmother died during the making of his 2013 album Beautiful Rewind, Hebden played some of the records and began experimenting by looping a vocal sample of Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar for three days before deciding to base an album around it. Hebden wanted to make a record with a similar structure to Indian music, particularly the raga mode, and decided to divide the album into a [...] "Morning Side" [...] and an [...] "Evening Side" [...] since many ragas relate to certain times of the day. Hebden also drew influences from English electronic music group Autechre and early electronic music, including American electronic composer Morton Subotnicks 1967 composition Silver Apples of the Moon, and wanted the album's production <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> low fidelity recording, while maintaining moments of high fidelity.|$|E
500|$|Yashiro's voice actor Yoshimasa Hosoya found {{singing for}} the role {{difficult}} as he lacked a natural sense of rhythm. Tiki's voice actress Sumire Morohoshi found the role difficult due to Tiki's role as an explanatory figure, together with the dramatic elements of her amnesia and wish to experience the real world. Tiki's first song [...] "Beastie Game" [...] drew from multiple musical genres to reflect her status as a vocaloid. When recording [...] "Beastie Game", Morohoshi was surprised upon hearing her voice processed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vocaloid. For her second song, [...] "Not A Phantom World", Morohoshi had to record multiple chorus elements which were then layered as backing for the main song, encountering difficulties making all her harmonies work together properly. Yuichi Nakamura portrayed Barry as the group's mood maker, while Maiko's actress Ami Koshimizu worked to make her character both aloof and charming. During voice and song recording, Aburai actively talked with the cast about their vocal nuances and interpretations of each song.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", a {{marathon}} twelve-minute opus which was edited for single release in some countries. The track {{begins with a}} guitar played <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> revving motorcycle, a reference to Todd Rundgren's contribution {{in the middle of}} [...] "Bat Out of Hell". Each verse comprises two things that he would do for love, followed by one thing that he would not do. It is that latter parts of each chorus that is the [...] "that" [...] of the title. However, some people misunderstand the lyrics, claiming that the singer never identifies what the [...] "that" [...] is that he is unwilling to do, a confusion that Steinman predicted during production. The song combines stadium rock and ballad for much of its twelve minutes. However, {{near the end of the}} song, a female vocalist is introduced. Credited in the liner notes as Mrs. Loud, this part was sung by Lorraine Crosby.|$|E
5000|$|According to the band, in an {{interview}} with John Kennedy on XFM, their name is pronounced as it is written, with the French plural for 'the' pronounced like the English name 'Les', as if it is a British person's attempt at speaking French. [...] "It's meant <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> English person mispronouncing a French word/words. Or it's a man called Les, with the surname Incompétents". The name is taken from a quote from the 1990 film Home Alone.|$|R
5000|$|On her eponymous 1993 release, Ashton {{was quoted}} during the {{recording}} of the album track [...] "Heart <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Rock, [...] "I was messing around doing vocals and singing along trying <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> electric guitar. We actually recorded it and that sound of me imitating the guitar is still kept in the final record. There {{was so much fun}} stuff on all those records and they were all a reflection of growth and maturity and life experience through those years." ...|$|R
50|$|The actors {{dress up}} in their soldier costumes and rig the horses <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> army ready <b>to</b> attack, with {{trumpets}} and drums behind. Kit and Peter pretend to be captives so Sir Philip will dismount, {{and he and his}} followers are then taken into custody by Desmond's men. Kit and Peter make a desperate dash back to London, and John Somers is captured by guards moments before he can shoot. Kit and Peter meet the Queen and tell her their adventures.|$|R
500|$|In the localization, they labeled him a samurai {{rather than}} a ronin – which is a subset of samurai – due to samurai being more {{recognizable}} and readily understood for Western players. They still portrayed him as a [...] "rude jerk", as {{they were able to}} preserve that aspect through word choice: Hsu said that both Japanese and English from the Victorian era could be verbose, making the two styles blend naturally during Blackquill's [...] "samurai" [...] sword metaphors. Blackquill's localized name was developed together with his manner of speech, and like with previous prosecutor characters, it was chosen to not be an [...] "overt pun", but rather a name with a double meaning that describes him. His surname comes from how he wears a samurai battle surcoat: these coats commonly feature the wearer's family crest. The crest on Blackquill's coat features a black-and-white feather, so his name was based on the color ("black") and the feather ("quill"). It was also made in reference to the character John Blackthorne from the novel Shōgun. The name was intended <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Victorian villain", to match his localized characterization and manner of speech.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music comes out, and how do you stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I {{was trying to be}} heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E
5000|$|We used full orchestral string {{arrangements}} {{here for}} the first time on any Who track. It seemed OK to do it with one of John's songs -- he was always struggling single-handed to lay down enough overdubbed brass parts on my stuff (especially Quadrophenia) <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> orchestra himself. Our arranger was my wife's inspired father, Ted Astley. The strings on this track are quantum. But it's another cynical, life-weary lyric, like 'New Song'. I wonder why John and I were so bored with life? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{band has}} stated that the pounding, {{relentless}} rhythm and shouted lyrics of the track were originally meant [...] "as a joke", and the single received little attention. They have also said in a The Guardian interview that the song is intended <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> alcoholic's internal dialogue and that Karl Hyde was an alcoholic at the time. Underworld have claimed that the [...] ".NUXX" [...] name {{was inspired by a}} computer fault that added that suffix to the name of their working files.|$|R

500|$|Ed Easton Jr. {{of radio}} station WNOW-FM called the song a [...] "cocky and hip hop based song" [...] and commented that Brown's ability to rap on [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was {{not close to}} LilWayne and Busta Rhymes' level. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine could not imagine why Brown would want to share the song with Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, stating [...] "One alone would've been enough to point up just how little {{personality}} he exudes on his own tracks, but putting both on 'Look at Me Now' ironically renders him invisible." [...] Music Review|work=Slant Magazine|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011}} Bri LaPelusa of UR Chicago called the song [...] "the most gangsta" [...] track on F.A.M.E., and wrote [...] "the abruptly homophobic/misogynistic lyrics and elementary rhyming from Busta Rhymes and LilWayne dampen the song's appeal." [...] F.A.M.E. - Review|publisher=UR Chicago|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011}} Chad Grischow of IGN wrote, [...] "Brown tries his hand at rapping on the out-of-place 'Look at Me Now', and is left in the dust by Lil Wayne and, suddenly resurgent, Busta Rhymes." [...] Staff members of Idolator criticized Brown for trying <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> second-class Soulja Boy Tell 'Em and praised Busta Rhymes' [...] "razor sharp verse" [...] as the song's highlight.|$|E
500|$|The down-tempo R piece {{features}} a guitar-laden background with synthesizers, and features lyrics {{about the physical}} attraction of a relationship. [...] "Slow Dance" [...] has been said <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Ciara's [...] "Promise" [...] and 1980's Prince ballad, and described as [...] "sparkly" [...] and [...] "psychedelic." [...] A writer for Spike called the song a [...] "digital lullaby." [...] Calling the lyrical content [...] "the ecstasy of desire with all the warmth of an alien observing life on Planet Earth", Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times said the song was impeccably arranged. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters stated, that on In A Perfect World..., songs like [...] "Slow Dance", [...] "tend to provide better matches between the vocals and the music, since the backdrop keeps things simple and the lyrics don’t always fall into slang and unintentional irony." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song [...] "excellent", commenting that the song was the album's high point. Sophie Bruce of BBC Music said the song [...] "is laden with potential in its first Prince-channelling two minutes, but loses its way completely when it breaks down into beatboxing." [...] Calling the album's slow numbers a problem, and the song itself [...] "smooth", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said [...] "Slow Dance" [...] was [...] "nothing more than a copy of Ciara's [...] "Promise." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his sixth}} studio album Yeezus (2013) as [...] "a protest to music," [...] West embraced an {{abrasive}} style that incorporated {{a variety of}} unconventional influences. Music critic Greg Kot described it as [...] "a hostile, abrasive and intentionally off-putting" [...] album that combines [...] "the worlds of" [...] 1980s acid-house and contemporary Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the [...] "avant-rap" [...] of Saul Williams, Death Grips and Odd Future. The album also incorporates elements of trap music, as well as dancehall, punk, and electro. Inspired by the minimalist design of Le Corbusier and primarily electronic in nature, and continues West's practice of eclectic and unusual samples. Rolling Stone called the album a [...] "brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct". West's seventh album The Life of Pablo was noted for its [...] "raw, occasionally even intentionally messy, composition" [...] in distinction to West's previous album. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "It's designed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> work in progress." [...] Carl Wilson of Slate characterized the album as creating [...] "strange links between Kanye's many iterations—soul-sample enthusiast, heartbroken Auto-Tune crooner, hedonistic avant-pop composer, industrial-rap shit-talker." [...] West initially characterized the release as [...] "a gospel album." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote in his review of The Life of Pablo, [...] "West's version of gospel touches {{on some of those}} sonic cues — heavy organ, soaring choirs — but seems more preoccupied with gospel text and the notion of redemption." ...|$|E
5000|$|Like many of {{the tracks}} on Guyville, [...] "Flower" [...] {{features}} only Phair and her guitar. However, the guitar has been distorted <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> somewhat <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wind instrument.|$|R
2500|$|The Backstreet Boys fully {{abandoned}} the Max Martin sound {{of many of}} their early hits and, instead, worked with different producers <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> adult vocal group. Dan Muckala, producer and co-songwriter of the group's hit single [...] "Incomplete" [...] from their previous album Never Gone, produced {{the bulk of the}} material. However, other producers like Emanuel Kiriakou, John Shanks and Billy Mann also worked on the album.
