25|$|In April 1959 Iran {{altered the}} legal status of the strait by {{expanding}} its territorial sea to 12-nautical-mile (22km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman expanded its territorial sea to 12nm by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely “closed” by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different with customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein”, including “the right of <b>transit</b> <b>passage</b> through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.|$|E
500|$|The present Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{was drafted}} in 1982 and came into force in 1994. It states that [...] "the high seas {{are open to}} all states, whether coastal or land-locked" [...] and {{provides}} a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, the building of artificial islands, fishing, and scientific research. It extended territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles (...) from a baseline generally (but not always) equivalent to the low-water line; this area is subject to national laws but free to both innocent and <b>transit</b> <b>passage.</b> (The [...] "internal waters" [...] landward of the baseline are solely under national control.) A [...] "contiguous zone" [...] of a further 12 nmi are permitted for hot pursuit of vessels charged with violating customs, taxation, immigration, or pollution laws in the territorial waters. An [...] "exclusive economic zone" [...] or EEZ places all exploitation of marine life and minerals within 200 nmi (...) of the baseline under national supervision. For legal purposes, the [...] "continental shelf" [...] {{is considered to be}} the actual continental shelf (to a depth of [...] ) contiguous to the baseline or 200 nmi, whichever is greater; the marine life and minerals [...] "attached to" [...] (or below) the seabed within this area also fall under national supervision.|$|E

2500|$|As the Strait of Hormuz at its narrowest is [...] wide, {{in order}} to {{traverse}} the strait, ships must stay within sea lanes that pass through the territorial waters of Iran and Oman under the <b>transit</b> <b>passage</b> provisions of customary Law of the Sea. It is therefore normal for ships, including warships, entering or leaving the Persian Gulf to transit Iranian territorial waters. During the Iran–Iraq War the Iranian forces frequently boarded and inspected neutral cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz in search of contraband destined for Iraq. While legal under international law, these inspections added to the tensions in the area.|$|E
2500|$|The contested {{sovereignty}} claims {{over the}} waters may complicate future shipping through the region: the Canadian government {{maintains that the}} Northwestern Passages are part of Canadian Internal Waters, but the United States and various European countries claim that they are an international strait and <b>transit</b> <b>passage,</b> allowing free and unencumbered passage. [...] If, as has been claimed, parts of {{the eastern end of}} the Passage are barely [...] deep, the route's viability as a Euro-Asian shipping route is reduced. However, a Chinese shipping line is planning regular voyages of cargo ships using the passage to the eastern United States and Europe, after a successful passage by Nordic Orion of 73,500 tonnes deadweight tonnage in September 2013. Fully loaded, Nordic Orion was too large to sail through the Panama Canal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, the U.S. Coast Guard {{icebreaker}} [...] {{passed through}} from Greenland to Alaska; the ship submitted to inspection by the Canadian Coast Guard before passing through, but the event infuriated the Canadian public {{and resulted in}} a diplomatic incident. The United States government, when asked by a Canadian reporter, indicated {{that they did not}} ask for permission as they were not legally required to. The Canadian government issued a declaration in 1986 reaffirming Canadian rights to the waters. The United States refused to recognize the Canadian claim. In 1988 the governments of Canada and the United States signed an agreement, [...] "Arctic Cooperation", that resolved the practical issue without solving the sovereignty questions. Under the law of the sea, ships engaged in <b>transit</b> <b>passage</b> are not permitted to engage in research. The agreement states that all U.S. Coast Guard vessels are engaged in research, and so would require permission from the Government of Canada to pass through.|$|E

The ships and aircraft of all nations, including warships, auxiliaries, and military aircraft, enjoy the right of unimpeded <b>transit</b> <b>passage</b> in such straits and their approaches. Submarines are free to transit international straits submerged since that is their normal mode of operation.

40|$|With the {{intention}} of satisfying mobility requirements for trustworthy, healthy and secure transport, there are more considerations on the establishment of intelligent transport systems (ITS) currently. Advanced traveller information systems (ATIS), {{as a part of}} ITS, is to provide travel time information as precisely as possible. Basically, there are reasons leading to delay in bus arrival time, e. g. traffic jam, ridership distribution, and climate situation. Consequently, these issues impress on growing travellers waiting time, postponement in timetable, rise in transit's expense and private vehicles' uses, dissatisfaction of passengers and reduction of passengers, providing of precise transit travel time information are significant since it will result in further <b>transit</b> <b>passages</b> and upsurge the acquiescence of passengers.

5000|$|Territorial waters or a {{territorial}} sea, {{as defined}} by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, is a belt of coastal waters extending at most [...] from the baseline (usually the mean low-water mark) of a coastal state.
