The biggest difference from traditional methods was that the traditional methods analyzed parts, but in this method, failure modes were analyzed and interval number was used to express expert opinions. <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> action for each failure mode was decomposed into several basic maintenance tasks. Comparatively speaking, the method had more adequate data and higher accuracy. Finally, the method was illustrated with an example. The analysis {{results showed that the}} method was feasible for the maintainability prediction of NC machine tools. It could solve the existing principal problems and provide a new idea for predicting <b>maintenance</b> in <b>the</b> field of NC machine tools...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} method to compute an optimal <b>maintenance</b> <b>date</b> for <b>the</b> test {{case of the}} heated hold-up tank. The system consists of a tank containing a fluid whose level is controlled by three components: two inlet pumps and one outlet valve. A thermal power source heats up the fluid. The failure rates of the components depends on the temperature, {{the position of the}} three components monitors the liquid level in the tank and the liquid level determines the temperature. Therefore, this system can be modeled by a hybrid process where the discrete (components) and continuous (level, temperature) parts interact in a closed loop. We model the system by a piecewise deterministic Markov process, propose and implement a numerical method to compute <b>the</b> optimal <b>maintenance</b> <b>date</b> to repair <b>the</b> components before the total failure of the system.

The limitation of testing-personnel quality and testing technology could bring about hidden failures for ignorance of some defects in devices. So {{it should be done}} to obey relevant electric regulations strictly, to update these regulations with the development of power grid, and to reinforce the {{management of}} the links like debugging, operation & maintenance, and setting. Then some hidden dangers can be avoided and series accidents evoked by tiny problems can be reduced as much as possible. Though action criterions for relay protections and SSCDs have been established based on the operating characteristics of the power grid, these criterions can’t be adapt to the operating characteristics of power grids forever and need to be updated timely. A device itself has to be faced with many operation problems such as harsh operating environment and aging of components resulted from device’s long time operation, possibly becoming contribute factors to hidden failures too. So in order to reduce accidents caused by devices’ hidden failures as much as possible strict supervision and early warning should be done with <b>the</b> condition-based <b>maintenance</b> <b>date</b> of secondary equipment.|$|R

To demonstrate the efficacy of our system, we illustrate our experience in dynamically updating and extending a Linux cluster. We introduce adaptive memory paging for efficient gang-scheduling, extend the kernel’s process scheduler to support unobtrusive fine-grain cycle stealing, apply public security fixes, and inject performance monitoring functionality to a selection of kernel functions.

40|$|Introduction A major {{constraint}} {{of animal}} production in south of Iran {{is the lack}} of cheap source of roughages. Date palm leaves (DPL) {{is one of the most}} abundant agricultural by-products in south of Iran. Almost all pruned leaves are discarded in the fields, mainly for nutrients recycling and soil conservation (M. Wan Zahari, et al 1999). <b>The</b> yearly <b>maintenance</b> of <b>date</b> palm tree produces a (around 20 kg per each tree) considerable quantities of green leaves (Bahman et al (1997); Pascual et al (2000)). Ruminant can utilize crop residues, with poor nutritional value. These residues are traditionally fed to animal as the main part of diet in many developing countries. However; dry matter intake of these by-products are not adequate to fulfill the nutrient requirements of livestock even at maintenance level (Dixon and Egan, 2002). DPL has a great potential for use as a roughage or bulk source in total mixed ration (TMR) for ruminants in dry areas. Detailed studies on fermentation characteristics and palatability of DPL silage, as well as on animal performance, have been reported by many workers (e. g. Abu Hassan and Ishida, 1991; Ishida and Abu Hassan, 1997; Oshio et al., 1999). Some researchers such as El-din and Tag-El-Din, 1996; and Bahman et al., 1997 have reported that DPL cannot be fed to animals because of low crude protein (6 - 7...|$|R

PTS is only appropriate in measuring the action of skilled workers in line production. Compared with actions, maintenance actions are more complex and accurate. How to apply PTS method in maintenance work considering these impact factors is still remained to solve. The MTM method is based on highest accuracy of nature and condition of gymnastic exercises. There is no double that this method would increase the difficulty of measuring, while the MOD method is relatively easy, the precision is also high.
