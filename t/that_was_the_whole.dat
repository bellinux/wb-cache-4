In his later years, Speer, talking with his biographer-to-be Gitta Sereny, explained how he felt in 1939: [...] "Of course I was perfectly aware that [...] sought world domination...t that time I asked for nothing better. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> point of my buildings. They would have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany. All I wanted was for this great man to dominate the globe." ...|$|E

"The meeting {{which took}} place after Easter in 1967 lasted two minutes … I told him in a few words the purpose of my visit: for him to bless the Congregation of the Holy Ghost which was due to hold an {{extraordinary}} General Chapter meeting … Then Padre Pio cried out. 'Me, bless an archbishop, no, no, it is you who should be blessing me!' And he bowed, to receive the blessing. I blessed him, he kissed my ring and continued {{on his way to}} the confessional... <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the meeting, no more, no less..." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music on}} Stone Temple Pilots was {{influenced}} by various styles, most notably country music and 1960s and 1970s rock. Various amps and vintage guitars from Dean's and Robert's personal collections were used to produce the desired sounds. Dean's guitars included two 1970s Gibson Les Pauls, a 1956 Stratocaster, three Telecasters dating between 1965 and 1966, and a 1960s double-cut Danelectro. An assortment of amps were used, including 10-, 15-, and 20-watt Valco speakers and late 1960s 18- and 20-watt Marshall combos. Robert recorded the bass lines to [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] with a 1950s six-string Danelectro Longhorn bass, and Weiland used Robert's collection of vintage microphones for some of his vocals. Dean exclaimed, [...] "Most bands do a retro thing and apologize for it. We're unapologetically retro here. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea!" ...|$|E

500|$|The next session, {{according}} to John Payne, occurred {{early in the}} morning, {{but it did not}} work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. [...] "It just didn't happen'" [...] says Payne. [...] "It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think {{that by the end of}} that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used. They just said, let's forget it." [...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|Rings Around the World was the Super Furry Animals' {{first album}} for Epic Records {{following}} the demise, in 1999, {{of their previous}} label Creation {{and the success of}} 2000's Mwng, which was issued on the band's own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a [...] "laid back and sort of wiped clean" [...] record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as [...] "a very ambitious project" [...] stating that [...] "We were trying to make a blockbuster album {{that was going to be}} like The Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting." [...] Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was [...] "into the excess of it, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> point". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E
2500|$|The name Pet Sounds was Love's invention, {{according}} to himself, Brian, and Jardine. Brian {{explained that the}} album was named [...] "after the dogs... <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea", and that the title was a [...] "tribute" [...] to Spector by matching his initials (PS), but could not recall who thought {{of going to the}} zoo. Love recounted: [...] "We were standing in the hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title.... We had taken pictures at the zoo and... there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" [...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality. It wasn't going in and doing another top ten. It had so much more meaning than that." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{optimizing}} strategy, {{based on}} the performance calculation of mechanical properties under high temperature, was proposed to study the method of fire protection design for steel staggered-truss framing system (SSTFS). <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> elastic-plastic process of <b>the</b> structure <b>is</b> investigated using <b>the</b> finite element method firstly, and the components which appear plastic deformation easily are found, and then their fire resistance rating would be enhanced especially. In comparison with the traditional regular fire protection strategy, it <b>is</b> confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fire resistant capacity of <b>the</b> SSTFS can <b>be</b> improved dramatically. And the security of <b>the</b> structure could <b>be</b> ensured, while <b>the</b> required volume of fire protection coatings is reduced...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a spatial stochastic process on the lattice Z d to model mass extinctions. Each {{site of the}} lattice may host a flock of up to N individuals.

Once the flock reaches N individuals, then, and only then, it starts giving birth on each of the 2 d neighboring sites at rate λ(N). Finally, disaster strikes at rate 1, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> flock disappears. Our model shows that, at least in theory, there is a critical maximum flock size above which a species is certain to disappear and below which it may survive...|$|R
50|$|A host’s {{immune system}} {{responds}} to pathogen invasion {{by a set}} of pathogen-specific responses in which many “players” participate; these include antibodies, T-helper cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and many others. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) are capable of internalizing pathogens and displaying a fragment of the antigen - the epitope - with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the cell surface. T-cell response is initiated when T-cells recognize these displayed epitopes. Only specific peptide sequences from some pathogen-specific antigens are needed to stimulate T- and B- cell responses; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> pathogenic peptide sequence is not necessary to initiate an immune response. The ‘immunome’ of a pathogen is described by its set of epitopes, and can be defined by comparing genome sequences and applying immunoinformatic tools.|$|R

2500|$|The book {{dates from}} c. 450–180 BCE {{and is a}} musing by King Solomon as he relates his {{experiences}} and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, introducing himself as Solomon ("son of David, king in Jerusalem") discusses {{the meaning of life}} {{and the best way to}} live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently , meaning [...] "vain" [...] or [...] "futile", ("mere breath"), as both wise and foolish end in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which <b>are</b> gifts from <b>the</b> hand of God.

25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who <b>are</b> {{concerned with}} <b>the</b> question of fundamentality. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> {{which is more}} ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of <b>the</b> default assumptions <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parts <b>are</b> more fundamental. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>is</b> grounded in its parts. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) <b>is</b> monism, where <b>the</b> parts <b>are</b> grounded in <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cosmos <b>is</b> more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of}} the cosmos. Then, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> identity theory which claims <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wholes</b> <b>are</b> not equal to <b>the</b> parts—they <b>are</b> numerically distinct from one another.
