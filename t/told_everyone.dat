25|$|Just {{before the}} police arrived, the gang decided {{to prepare for}} action and let their prisoners go, but Mrs Jones told them to stay to hear Ned lecture.

Constable Bracken grabbed {{the key to the}} room in which he and others were held, <b>told</b> <b>everyone</b> to lie low if there was any firing, and escaped. He rushed to the railway station at which the train had just arrived and explained the situation to the police. Supt.

25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he <b>told</b> <b>everyone</b> how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E

This aspect of the episode was praised by fans as wells as the cast and crew. Brent Forrester, the co-writer of the episode, noted that Einhorn's [...] "energy doubled when shooting that" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|... c. [...] There is {{an ongoing}} dispute about El Greco's birthplace. Most {{researchers}} and scholars give Candia as his birthplace. Nonetheless, according to Achileus A. Kyrou, a prominent Greek journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the ruins of his family's house are still extant {{in the place where}} old Fodele was (the village later changed location because of pirate raids). Candia's claim to him is based on two documents from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65. Fodele natives argue that El Greco probably <b>told</b> <b>everyone</b> in Spain he was from Heraklion because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele.|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different.

[...] "Even the album title was misunderstood.", Billy Corgan wrote on the band's website that the title Adore “was a joke that no one ever got,” explaining that Adore was meant as a play on “A Door,” meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band’s career. [...] By the end of 1998, Corgan, who would later call the making of Adore [...] "one of the most painful experiences of my life", was already writing material for the band's next album, and Jimmy Chamberlin was readmitted into the band.|$|E

The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite so crazy in his life, going on with an outdoor show in the worst kind of weather, rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely."
