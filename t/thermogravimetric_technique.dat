40|$|A <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>technique</b> was {{explored}} {{in order to}} precisely investigate the low nitrogen solubilities in metals. The thermogravimetry (TG) set-up is presented in detail. By the optimization of the set-up, a good baseline (noise level < 2 mu g, curve drift: +/- 1 - 4 mu g/h) was obtained.
