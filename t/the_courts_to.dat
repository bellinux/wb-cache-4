5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

50|$|Israel {{initially}} {{announced that}} it would cooperate with <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> while noting that advisory rulings of the ICJ are not binding. Israel later made a written submission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> rejecting <b>the</b> authority of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> rule on <b>the</b> case, but announced (on February 12, 2004) that it would not appear at <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> make oral submissions.|$|R
25|$|The lawsuit {{continued}} through the fall of 2009 and into 2010. The D.C. Attorney General asked <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> dismiss <b>the</b> suit on October 11, but <b>the</b> <b>court</b> declined <b>to</b> do so on November 18. The city asked for a reconsideration of its motion on December 1, but <b>the</b> <b>court</b> declined <b>to</b> do so on January 6, 2010.|$|R
5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> be involved in that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of}} the Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power.|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} levelled {{against the}} ground of review {{is that it has}} the potential of allowing <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> overstep <b>the</b> scope of its power. Consequently, this erodes [...] "tribunal autonomy". Since the Fong Thin Choo test recognizes <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> power <b>to</b> inquire into the evidence upon which the decision was based, this permits <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> merits of the case. This is a departure from the traditional position, where <b>the</b> <b>court</b> restricts itself <b>to</b> assessing the legality of decisions. Nonetheless, it is only where the lack of evidence significantly affects the outcome of the decision that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> is willing <b>to</b> exercise its power of judicial review and intervene on this ground.|$|R

5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, the Erie {{doctrine}} requires <b>the</b> Federal <b>court</b> <b>to</b> {{predict how}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> {{of a given}} state would rule and decide a given issue.

5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
5|$|Final {{adjudication}} of probate found a {{total of}} eight parties or groups of relatives, {{most of whom were}} descended from Moana and her four husbands, as heirs to the Kana ªina estate splitting {{a total of}} 9 shares, with 2 shares going to one party. The probate records include {{a great deal of information}} from the four years of litigation. A great number of people petitioned <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> claim title as heirs after the initial 1878 judgement. In the final adjudication, Bernice Pauahi Bishop received two of the nine shares. The remaining seven of the nine shares were divided equally in 1/9th and distributed to Ruth Keelik≈çlani, Haalilio and Haalelea (namesakes of the historic figures), Kilinahe (Whose grandmother was the older sister of Kanaina's mother and 5 other parties. The first three trustees included John Mott-Smith and Sanford B. Dole.|$|E
5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The {{existence of the}} same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's discretionary powers under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the objective test would empower <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E
