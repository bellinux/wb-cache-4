The price increase {{was expected to be}} rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 {{through the end of the}} third quarter. In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.|$|E
5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144. The name Oberkassel {{refers to a}} Roman fortification; {{in the course of}} time [...] "Romerkastell" [...] (Roman castle) became [...] "Oberkassel". Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 873), Büchel (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1202), Broich (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1442).|$|R

5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was {{a substitute for}} another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, {{which had to be}} abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|Continuing westward, Inez made {{landfall}} {{as a small}} hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, {{the storm}} flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. Nationwide, there were about 100deaths and $12million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000people were killed, and 60,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September30. In the country, 125,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20million in damage.|$|E
50|$|The tour {{included}} a headlining show at Download Festival, playing the festival's venue - Donington Park - for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 16 years.

50|$|The 1961 Hawthorn Football Club {{season was}} the clubs 37th {{season in the}} Victorian Football League. The 1961 season was a {{historical}} one for Hawthorn finishing top of the ladder and claiming the McClelland Trophy for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history, reaching the Grand Final for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history, and winning the Premiership for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history.|$|R
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco {{was called}} up for International duty for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> two years while on loan at Parma, earning his first senior call-up for Italy on 6 February 2011; {{he made his}} Italy senior team debut on 9 February, in a {{friendly}} match against Germany in Dortmund, which ended in a 1–1 draw, coming on as a second half substitute for Stefano Mauri. In his second international appearance, against Ukraine, he provided an assist from a back-heel for Alessandro Matri's goal as Italy won the match 2–0 in Kiev. After some promising substitute appearances, manager Cesare Prandelli stated that he would give Giovinco his full international debut as a starter alongside Antonio Cassano, which came later that year on 11 October, in a 3–0 home win over Northern Ireland in a European qualifier.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> {{two decades}} that number 1 played number 2 and neither {{had won the}} French Open previously. Andy Murray had a career {{resurgence}} on clay, making deep runs in the Masters tournaments prior to the French Open, finishing runner up to Djokovic in Madrid before besting him in Rome. Rain had affected the tournament schedule and in Djokovic's case, he had to play 4 matches in 5 days. Murray was playing {{to become the first}} Brit since 1937 to win, while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line, most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time. After Murray took the first set, Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing in four sets.|$|E
50|$|The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers {{failed to}} qualify for the playoffs. This marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 20 seasons that both teams missed the playoffs.

50|$|The Canadian Amateur {{stayed in}} Ontario and Quebec until 1921, {{when it went}} to Manitoba. It went to Alberta for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1929, to British Columbia for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1932, to Atlantic Canada for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1949, and to Saskatchewan for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1950. Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R
25|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> its history, <b>the</b> tournament {{opened with}} a Friday night fixture. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a decade, all of the teams had the same head coach as in the {{previous}} year's tournament.|$|R
5|$|Rose and Slash reunited for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, {{one of the}} most-anticipated reunion {{tours in}} rock history.

Rose shared a stage with Slash for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> 23 years during the group's surprise performance at The Troubadour in April 2016, ahead of its headlining shows at Coachella. He additionally joined Australian hard rock band AC/DC to perform as lead singer for the remainder of the band's Rock or Bust World Tour, after long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson had to stop touring due to hearing problems. Subsequent reports indicated that guitarist Angus Young will continue the band with Rose as its official lead singer.|$|E
5|$|When Operation Linebacker {{began in}} May 1972, American fighter jets {{returned}} to the offense in the skies over North Vietnam for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> four years. Navy and Marine Corps fighters, reaping the benefits of their TOPGUN program, immediately enjoyed considerable success. In contrast by June, as Olds had predicted, the Air Force's fighter community was struggling with a nearly 1:1kill-loss ratio. To the new Inspector General, Lt Gen , Olds offered to take a voluntary reduction in rank to colonel so he could return to operational command and straighten out the situation. Olds {{decided to leave the}} Air Force when the offer was refused (he was offered another inspection tour instead) and he retired on June 1, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking his foot {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. He was sidelined for 18games, marking the first time in Henrik's career that he played without his brother for an extended period. In Daniel's absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November 2009, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to Daniel's 22 November return, Henrik scored seven goals in seven games. He continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25points (five goals, 20assists) in 15games to be named the NHL's First Star of the Month. The following month, he was named Second Star, having recorded 25points in 13games. On 7 January 2010, Henrik moved into top spot in the NHL scoring race, ahead of San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton with a three-assist night against the Phoenix Coyotes. It marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> five years, since Näslund was tied with Robert Lang on 18 February 2004, that a Canucks player held the League lead in scoring. During a 3–1 win against the Calgary Flames on 14 March, Henrik recorded his 416th career assist to pass Trevor Linden as Vancouver's all-time leader. On 27 March, he scored two assists against the San Jose Sharks to become the fourth Canuck in team history to record a 100-point season (after Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Markus Näslund). He was named Third Star of the Month for March after scoring 24points in 15games.|$|E
