The difference in the probe-H and probe-CN interaction energies is very large for the H/CN data storage system, making this the best system studied to date.

50|$|The {{resolution}} of a PSTM instrument is {{highly dependent on}} <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> geometry and diameter. Probes are typically fabricated via chemical etching of an optical fiber in a solution of HF and can be apertured or apertureless. Using chemical etching, fiber tips with a curvature radius as low as 20 nm have been made. In apertured tips, {{the sides of the}} sharpened fiber are sputter coated in a metal or other material. This helps to limit tunnelling of photons {{into the side of the}} probe in order to maintain more consistent and accurate evanescent field coupling. Due to the rigidity of the fiber probe, even brief contact with the surface will destroy the <b>probe</b> <b>tip.</b> Larger <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> have a greater degree of coupling to the evanescent field and will therefore have greater collection efficiency due to a larger area of the optical fiber interacting with the field. The primary limitation of a large tip is the increased probability of collision with rougher surface features as well as photon tunnelling into the side of the probe. A narrower <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> is necessary to resolve more abrupt surface features without collision, however the collection efficiency will be reduced. Figure 3 shows that fiber probe with metal coating. In metal coated fiber probes, the diameter and geometry of the aperture, or uncoated area at the <b>tip</b> of the <b>probe,</b> determines the collection efficiency. Wider cone angles result in larger aperture diameters and shorter probe lengths, while narrower cone angles result in smaller aperture diameters and longer probes. Double tapered probetips have been developed in which a long, narrow region of the probe tapers into a tip with a wider cone angle. This provides a wider aperture for greater collection efficiency while still maintaining a long narrow <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> capable of resolving abrupt surface features with low risk of collision.|$|R

An NFMM measurement typically suffers from small signal {{in the presence of}} seemingly overwhelming white and 1 /f noise.

This thesis describes the design and characterization of probe circuits and probe tips which enable sensitive and high-resolution NFMM with enhanced signals.

CMMs are widespread and dependable instruments in industry and laboratories for dimensional measurement. From the <b>tip</b> <b>probe</b> sensor to the machine display, there is a complex transformation of probed point coordinates through the geometrical feature model that makes the assessment of accuracy and uncertainty measurement results difficult. Therefore, error compensation is not standardized, conversely to other simpler instruments.

In this paper a new model type of error compensation is proposed. It evaluates the error from the vectorial composition of length error by axis and its integration into the geometrical measurement model. The non-explained variability by the model is incorporated into the uncertainty budget. Model parameters are analyzed and linked to the geometrical errors and uncertainty of CMM response.

The proposed models are useful for measurement improvement with easy integration into CMM signal processing, in particular in industrial environments where built-in solutions are sought. A battery of implementation tests are presented in Part II, where the experimental endorsement of the model is included...|$|E
40|$|We present {{theoretical}} and experimental results on switching and tuning of a two-dimensional photonic crystal resonant microcavity {{by means of}} a silicon AFM <b>tip,</b> <b>probing</b> the highly localized optical field {{in the vicinity of the}} cavity. On-off switching and modulation of the transmission signal in the kHz range is achieved by bringing an AFM tip onto the center of the microcavity, inducing a damping effect on the transmission resonance. Tuning of the resonant wavelength in the order of several nanometers becomes possible by inserting the AFM tip into one of the holes of the Bragg mirror forming the microcavity in the propagation direction...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a scanning gate tip in the nonlinear quantum transport properties of nanostructures. Generally, we predict that the symmetry of the current-voltage characteristic in reflection-symmetric samples is broken by a tip-induced rectifying conductance correction. Moreover, {{in the case of a}} quantum point contact (QPC), the tip-induced rectification term becomes dominant as compared to the change of the linear conductance at large tip-QPC distances. Calculations for a weak <b>tip</b> <b>probing</b> a QPC modeled by an abrupt constriction show that these effects are experimentally observable.

40|$|Tip-enhanced Raman {{spectroscopy}} (TERS) {{is based}} on the optical excitation of localized surface plasmons in the tip-substrate cavity, which provides a large but local field enhancement near the tip apex. We report on TERS with smooth single crystalline surfaces as substrates. The adsorbates were CN- ions at Au(111) and malachite green isothiocyanate (MGITC) molecules at Au(111) and Pt(110) using either Au or Ir tips. The data analysis yields Raman enhancements of about 4 x 10 (5) for CN- and up to 10 (6) for MGITC at Au(111) with a Au <b>tip,</b> <b>probing</b> an area of less than 100 nm radius...|$|R
