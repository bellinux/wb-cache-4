The importance of energy security grows along with the growing dependency of states on the energy resources, and also by growing rivalry in international system for control of the resources. Energy resources are becoming part of economy, foreign policy and as well as various security elements. Analyzing states through prism of energy security it is possible to identify the main actors in the filed of energy security, to distinguish levels of their influence, to determine their links and interactions. This allows constructing global energy security system.

40|$|Bulgaria is a {{significant}} natural gas <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> in the EU (a role set to increase with the South Stream and potential Nabucco West gas pipelines) and a Member State subject to EU regulation. As a result, the regulation of natural gas {{in the country is}} of direct relevance to the development, implementation and realisation of EU energy security policy. However, the transposition of the EU’s Third Energy package seem to be dependent on the role of intermediaries in the process of transiting natural gas through and within Bulgaria. This paper uses a conceptual frame which merges literature on energy infrastructure networks, intermediaries and power to explain some key problems for natural gas supply policy in Bulgaria and the lack of transparency within the sector. The conclusion offers an explanation of how the existence of Bulgarian intermediaries influences the use of national natural gas pipelines as transmission belts for national, Russian and EU policy, as well as a series of objectives including: increasing household gasification, further liberalisation of the Bulgarian natural gas market and increasing transparency in Bulgarian energy policy...|$|E
40|$|The Russian-Ukrainian gas {{crisis of}} January 2009, {{occurring}} {{three years after}} a similar dispute between Moscow and Kyiv had disrupted Russian natural gas supplies to Europe, led many European commentators to question the continued reliability of Russia as a supplier of natural gas. The role of Ukraine as an energy <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> was also put under the spotlight. The January 2009 crisis followed the conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008. This brief war had compelled governments in member states of the European Union (EU) to reconsider the wisdom of being dependent for over 40 percent of their gas imports from an increasingly emboldened and aggressive Russia. Attention has focussed more on developing projects which would supply natural gas to Europe from sources other than Russia along routes which would bypass Russian territory. The so-called “fourth” or “southern” gas corridor connecting the Caspian and Gulf regions and the Middle East to Europe (the other three corridors running to EU member states from Russia, Norway and north Africa), has been identified by the European Commission as Natural Gas (NG) Route Number 3 {{in the framework of}} the Trans-European energy networks (TEN-E) ...|$|E
30|$|Whether or not Ukraine’s {{descent into}} EU energy {{security}} inconsequence {{is good or}} bad for Europe depends on which outcome is more important. Reliance on Russian gas is not necessarily a bad thing if its supply is reliable, cheap and free of expensive political payoffs such as further expansionist gains or the rise of a vast non-liberal market to the east. Yet as Nord Stream demonstrates, Russia and EU energy companies value reliable long-term direct links over transit options, even if the initial investment costs seem prohibitive. South Stream or any alternative southern detour {{may not be the most}} profitable in the short run, but it will absolve Russia from the threat of a <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> siphoning off its gas to Europe, and that is certainly in the interest both parties. In the short to medium term this could make the EU concurrently more reliant on cheap Russian gas, more secure in its supply, and put it back on track to cut out its uncomfortable dependence on coal. In the long run, it frees up time and resources to maximize return resulting from structural changes in the international gas market. Breaking the EU’s energy and trade relationship with Russia over Ukraine may seem to some to be the right ‘feel good’ thing to do here and now. But completely eliminating it is neither politically nor economically prudent.|$|E

30|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that the main chains of PHCS-g-PNVCL collapsed and curled initially to form a spherical hydrophobic core under aqueous condition. As the TEM image shown in Fig. S 4 A, it could be seen clearly {{that a lot of}} cores (black domains) generated at the initial time. And then, the rest of these main chains after the intramolecular assembly changed their spatial configuration spontaneously to form apparent hydrophilic chains in water under the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. These apparent hydrophilic chains and the grafted hydrophilic PNVCL chains stretched into aqueous medium to form a hydrophilic corona to stabilize the micelles (as the amplified graph shown in Fig.  3). Because of the hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic interactions between the main chains of the copolymers, several mono micelles would link together to generate the reported pod-like supramicelles with several hydrophobic cores and a supra hydrophilic corona, as shown in Fig.  3. It could also be observed from the TEM images in Fig. S 4 B-C that the polymers assembled into a micelle with a tail (aggregates {{of the rest of the}} main chains) which might be a <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> in the formation procedure of the supramicelles, and then these mono micelles were linked together by their tails to form the pod-like supramicelles, as shown in Fig. S 4 D.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} roles of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia as ‘energy transit states’ for Middle Eastern oil flows, with {{specific}} reference to their efforts to ensure the Malacca Strait’s safety, security and environmental protection. The Malacca Strait {{is one of the}} world’s major chokepoints for oil shipped from the Arabian Peninsula to East Asia. While many scholars focus on the producers and consumers involved in this transnational energy supply chain, few have considered the third party countries that are located between them, or how they might contribute to supply chain security. And while a growing number of contributions seek to understand such ‘energy transit states’ for oil and gas pipelines in the South Caucasus and Black Sea regions, those in Southeast Asia are under-evaluated. Appraisals of Singaporean, Indonesian and Malaysian foreign policies tend to assume that the three states have ‘common interests’ in upholding Strait security, and hence a sound basis for cooperation. Balance of Power expectations about alliance formation, and claims that Southeast Asian countries engage in consensus decision making practices and avoid interference in each others’ affairs, {{often referred to as the}} ‘ASEAN Way,’ also support this view. It is certainly the case that Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia have engaged in a variety of efforts to protect the Malacca Strait, which accelerated in intensity following Admiral Thomas Fargo’s (at the time Commander, United States Pacific Command) announcement in 2004 that a Regional Maritime Security Initiative would be established. Yet this was an initiative that Indonesia and Malaysia in particular saw as encroaching on their respective jurisdictions in the sea lane. More generally, assumptions about the likelihood of cooperation do not accord with less optimistic predictions that states will increasingly compete where strategic energy resources—such as oil—are involved. This thesis therefore evaluates Singapore’s, Indonesia’s and Malaysia’s interests and policy choices toward the Malacca Strait with respect to their energy <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> status. It does so in order to better understand whether claims about their common interests engendering cooperation in the sea lane actually hold, and offer a more cogent explanation of their interactions than arguments based on the Balance of Power or the ASEAN Way. To assess this, I develop a framework based on three types of energy transit states: the ‘enmeshed energy transit state,’ the ‘fledgling energy transit state’ and the ‘rising energy <b>transit</b> <b>state.</b> ’ I find that the three countries under review have markedly different stakes in Middle East-East Asia oil flows, and that this has shaped the scope of their agendas as well as the intensity of their security cooperation. In addition, I find that competition among the three has also been important, as each state seeks to capitalise on the supply chain for their own advantage. Thus, viewed through the lens of oil, a better account of the countries’ interactions is one that recognises their converging and diverging interests. With Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia all expected to maintain, if not increase, their involvement in the transit oil supply chain, their motivations to both cooperate and compete in the Malacca Strait could be exacerbated in what is already a complicated maritime environment...|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile the EU, {{captured}} by German insistence, broke {{a deal with}} the Turkish government on 18 March 2016 to manage the refugee crisis and fight human trafficking on the Mediterranean. Turkey was promised 3 billion € in support for the Syrian refugees in Turkey and in exchange for an agreement that keep Syrian refugees in Turkey. In addition, every captured refugee that would illegally try to come to Europe over the Mediterranean on human trafficker boats would be exchanged legally with a Syrian refugee hosted in Turkish refugee camps (“one in, one out”). The EU, notably Germany, would accept refugees from Turkey’s up to three million hosted refugees. The EU hopes to cut off unregulated refugee inflow, and undermine human traffickers’ economic base. After being active for 1 year, only 3500 refugees from Turkey have been exchanged. Human rights organisations criticize that agreement since it would provide only marginal legal option to go to Europe, while more and more refugees would suffer from depression. Turkey, with its questionable human rights standards and poor democracy and as a destination and source for refugees like from Kurdistan, can be seen as prime example for a semi-peripheral <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> in the European-Middle East theatre. It is not only hosting refugees, but since 2016 also a state that generates refugees through repressive policies against the own population.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} Turkey’s current and {{potential}} {{role in the}} supply of Greater Caspian {{oil and natural gas}} to Europe, on the background of the EU’s need for energy and the geography of the regional supply of oil and gas. Turkey is central to his triangular analysis as it is negotiating to become a candidate for EU membership, has close links with the Caspian countries and has the potential to function as an East-West energy corridor. On a theoretical level, the thesis explores the links between geopolitics and energy security in a new world energy order, given the location of energy resources and the difficulties of transporting them to European markets, considering the position of Russia as a significant energy producer, key <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> in its own right and major Eurasian strategic player. In order to address these issues, the thesis examines the existing and potential pipeline infrastructure for natural gas and oil supplies from the Greater Caspian region to Europe via Turkey and discusses what role the EU is already playing, and might be expected to play in the future. The major policy-relevant finding of this thesis is that Turkey in the medium term likely will take on an essential role in European energy security as a major westward conduit for Caspian hydrocarbons. The thesis also argues that the EU's energy security cannot be achieved solely through an intra-EU approach to energy issues, but {{that it is necessary to}} adopt a holistic approach that also deals with external policy, including Turkey’s role and cooperation with the petroleum-producing countries in the Greater Caspian region. The major theoretical finding of the thesis is that geopolitics does matter, although it also depends on the will and ability of those representing a country such as Turkey to realize the geopolitical potential...|$|E
40|$|Developed {{states have}} what might charitably {{be called a}} {{schizophrenic}} attitude towards international refugee law. Determined to remain formally engaged with refugee law and yet unwavering in their commitment to avoid assuming {{their fair share of}} practical responsibilities under that regime, wealthier countries have embraced the politics of non-entrée, comprising efforts to keep refugees away from their territories but without formally resiling from treaty obligations. As the early generation of non-entrée practices – visa controls and carrier sanctions, the establishment of “international zones,” and high seas deterrence – has proved increasingly vulnerable to practical and legal challenges, new forms of non-entrée predicated on interstate cooperation have emerged in which deterrence is carried out by the authorities of the home or a <b>transit</b> <b>state,</b> or at least in their territory. The critical question we address here is whether such cooperation-based mechanisms of non-entrée are – as developed states seem to believe – capable of insulating them from legal liability in ways that the first generation of non-entrée strategies were not. We show that three evolving areas of international law – jurisdiction, shared responsibility, and liability for aiding or assisting – are likely to stymie many if not all of the new forms of non-entrée. Indeed, while legal liability is least clear where the sponsoring state engages in only diplomatic outreach, the provision of financial incentives, or training of personnel or provision of equipment, these options for cooperative deterrence are increasingly viewed by developed countries as unattractive given the inherent uncertainties about whether there will be a solid and dependable deterrent return. The inclination to become more directly involved in order to achieve more control and thereby to increase the likelihood of efficacy thus often pushes states to the more interventionist end of the spectrum of contemporary non-entrée. Yet it is when a state’s own personnel are deployed in aid of deterrence abroad or where joint or shared enforcement is established that legal liability becomes most clear. Powerful states are thus faced with a trade-off between the efficiency of non-entrée mechanisms and the ability to avoid responsibility under international refugee law. If, as we believe probable, the preference for more rather than less control persists, legal challenges are likely to prove successful. Law will thus {{be in a position to}} serve a critical role in provoking a frank conversation about how to replace the duplicitous politics of non-entrée with a system predicated on the meaningful sharing of the burdens and responsibilities of refugee protection around the world...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to conduct a complex {{research}} {{of the state of}} transport structure of Ukraine and substantiate prospects of its development. The developed transport system and corresponding infrastructure are a guarantee of high level of the country’s development, increasing the level of its investing attractiveness. Moreover, transport infrastructure serves as a uniting factor in the process of integration. Thus, the main function of transport infrastructure is the formation of external conditions for the management of economic entities. It is determined that the development of a state directly depends on how efficiently it performs management in different spheres. First of all, it concerns transport infrastructure. Today, the global trends necessitate constant perfection of management of transport infrastructure, in particular, investment attraction. The state and development level of transport infrastructure {{is one of the most}} important factors of socio-economic development of both member states of the European Union and Ukraine. Transport infrastructure occupies a services market sector with a market share of 75 %. And in the macroeconomic context, the share of transport infrastructure in the overall volume of gross domestic product of Ukraine is 7 %. In the modern management conditions, a negative dynamics of transportation and its share in the gross domestic product of Ukraine are determined mostly by the influence of economic crisis processes and negative state of development of transport infrastructure of the country. For the evaluation of activities of transport of Ukraine, we used the main indicators of its performance as criteria. The main criteria of performance evaluation of transport are: the volume of cargo transportation, cargo turnover, the ratio of modes of transport in cargo transportation, the volume of passenger transportation, passenger turnover, the cost of transportation, the ratio of passenger and cargo traffic in the economy. Transport, as an infrastructure branch, should provide timely and efficient cargo and passenger transportation and promote the integration of the Ukrainian economy into the European and world economic system. However, the existing unsatisfactory condition of the rolling stock of various types of transport in Ukraine causes a low level of using the potential of Ukraine as a <b>transit</b> <b>state</b> and, accordingly, reduces the competitiveness of the country’s economy. Summarizing the above, it should be noted that the development of the transport infrastructure of Ukraine is largely determined by the ability of authorities to implement systemic institutional changes aimed at conducting reforms. First of all, this concerns the implementation of the policy of European integration. In particular, it is necessary to create favourable conditions for the development of entrepreneurship, to realize the power decentralization and complete the administrative and territorial reform, to ensure further liberalization of foreign economic activity and to increase the efficiency of the use of financial resources allocated by the EU to support economic reforms in our country...|$|E
