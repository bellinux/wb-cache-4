This act created a 36 percent to 39.6 percent income tax for high-income {{individuals}} in the top 1.2% of wage earners. Businesses were given an income tax rate of 35%.

40|$|One of {{the most}} active {{disputes}} in tax law today is the question of the proper tax consequences for a successful plaintiff, a <b>portion</b> of whose <b>taxable</b> damage award is paid to his or her attorney pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement. At issue is whether the plaintiff is <b>taxable</b> on the <b>portion</b> of the award that is payable to the attorney. One aspect of this problem was resolved prospectively by the adoption of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, but the problem continues to exist in other areas. The United States Supreme Court resolved a split in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals with respect to the taxation of contingent attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees in Commissioner v. Banks, but that decision provides no comfort for the plight of taxpayers because the government prevailed. Moreover, the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fee dispute is only one small example of a much larger problem. Instead of dealing with the root cause of the problem, the focus (both in the courts and in Congress) has been on whether to provide a 2 ̆ 2 fix 2 ̆ 2 for the specific plight of the taxpayers who have raised issues in court. The courts and Congress, like the Little Dutch Boy, may be willing to plug one hole, but the broader problem is a structural fault in the 2 ̆ 2 dam 2 ̆ 2 of the tax law system-namely, the improper classification of a significant number of expenditures as itemized deductions. This Article argues that the current list of nonitemized deductions wrongly excludes a number of items, especially some that are directly connected to the production of income. This erroneous exclusion imposes an unwarranted and severe tax burden in far more circumstances than the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fee problem on which Congress exclusively focused in the American Job Creation Act of 2004. The harsh consequences resulting from the misclassification of a number of items are exacerbated by the stringent limitations currently imposed on many itemized deductions; but even a repeal of those limitations, which is unlikely to occur, will not cure all of the harm that a wrongful classification causes. This author hopes that highlighting several examples of misclassification will induce Congress to implement a commission to study the entire classification system, rather than to rest on its laurels for solving one small part of the problem in the American Job Creation Act of 2004...|$|R
50|$|For example, assume {{an estate}} of $3.5 million in 2006. There are two {{beneficiaries}} who will each receive equal {{shares of the}} estate. The maximum allowable credit is $2 million for that year, so the taxable value is therefore $1.5 million. Since it is 2006, the tax rate on that $1.5 million is 46%, so the total taxes paid would be $690,000. Each beneficiary will receive $1,000,000 of untaxed inheritance and $405,000 from the <b>taxable</b> <b>portion</b> of their inheritance {{for a total of}} $1,405,000. This means the estate would have paid a taxable rate of 19.7%.|$|E
5000|$|The credit {{against the}} Federal tax {{may be reduced}} if the state has an {{outstanding}} advance (commonly called a “loan”). When states lack the funds to pay UI benefits, they may obtain loans from the federal government. To assure that these loans are repaid, and in accordance with Title XII of the Social Security Act, {{the federal government is}} entitled to recover those monies by reducing the FUTA credit it gives to employers, which is the equivalent of an overall increase in the FUTA tax. When a state has an outstanding loan balance on January 1 for two consecutive years, and the full amount of the loan is not repaid by November 10 of the second year, the FUTA credit will be reduced until the loan is repaid. This process is commonly called FUTA Credit Reduction and was designed as an involuntary repayment mechanism. The reduction schedule is 0.3% for the first year and an additional 0.3% for each succeeding year until the loan is repaid. From the third year onward, there may be additional reduction(s) in the FUTA tax credit (commonly dubbed [...] "add-ons"). For example, for taxable years 2012 and 2013, Virgin Islands had a [...] "2.7 add-on" [...] when its tax rate on total wages was below a national minimum. For taxable year 2014, Connecticut had a [...] "BCR add-on" [...] when its tax rate on the <b>taxable</b> <b>portion</b> of covered wages in the previous calendar year is less than the 5-year benefit cost ratio applicable for the taxable year.|$|E

40|$|This paper articulates a {{case for}} Indiana to exempt all non-land {{property}} from the <b>taxable</b> <b>portion</b> of the property tax base. This moves the state closer to a tax system that has great support among economists for its advantages in encouraging economic growth, progressivity, and reducing environmental damage from urban sprawl. Indiana might particularly benefit from a land only tax because of its unique system of property tax caps. The merits of this approach hinge on driving a wedge between gross assessed value and net taxable value. Future empirical {{research is needed to}} determine the distributional impact that would result from such a policy change. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Nonprofit {{organizations}} earn both tax-exempt and taxable revenues. The <b>taxable</b> <b>portion</b> {{of nonprofit}} revenues is nonprofits smallest, yet most quickly growing revenue source. Because nonprofits {{may have a}} natural aversion to ancillary activities, taxable ventures need to provide higher returns than alternative investments. This paper examines how nonprofits ’ ability to exploit production complementarities increases the available returns to taxable activities thus providing incentives to earn additional taxable revenues given the decision to engage in taxable ventures. The paper tests the theory that complementarities encourage taxable activities because they increase pre-tax returns owing to lower production costs and after-tax returns by {{making it easier to}} allocate joint costs from tax-exempt to taxable activities. Results find support for both hypotheses. Additional results find that industry grouping, and age can be used as reasonable proxies for a nonprofit’s ability to exploit production complementarities...|$|E
40|$|F {{or most of}} its 90 -year existence, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service and its {{predecessor}} organizations have used data provided by taxpayers on Forms 1040 to ful-fill the legal mandate to produce statistics on the opera-tion of the individual income tax system. It was not un-til Tax Year 1989 that SOI started using the Information Returns Master File (IRMF), which contains electronic documents filed by the payers of income to individuals, to add further details to the tax return information. To date, the SOI Bulletin has featured articles on the dis-tribution of salaries and wages from Forms W- 2 [1] and the accumulation of assets in Individual Retirement Ac-counts from Forms 5498 [2], based on this rich source of administrative data. In this paper, the authors make a modest proposal for another set of statistics that could be produced from the IRMF which would shed light {{not only on the}} operation of the individual income tax and the Social Security tax systems, but also on the interac-tion of the two systems. The paper illustrates some of the analysis that could be produced with this file. 	 Components of the Social Security Impact Figure 1 starts from the total income of everybody touched by the Social Security system, either as a payer of Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) taxes, or as a recipient of Social Security benefits. The first line shows total income, which, for filers of tax returns, is the sum of all sources of income as shown on line 22 of Form 1040, or the equivalent lines of Forms 1040 -A and 1040 -EZ. For the purpose of this chart, the <b>taxable</b> <b>portion</b> of Social Security benefits has been excluded. One of the advantages of working with information documents is that they enable SOI to show information on individuals who have not filed (and may never file) income tax returns for a given year. For these indi-viduals, total income can be computed by adding sala-ries and wages from Forms W- 2, gambling winnings from Forms W- 2 G, and nonemployee compensation, unemployment compensation, rents, royalties, inter-est, dividends, and pension distributions from variou...|$|E
