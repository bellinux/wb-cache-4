5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since they were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> will be saved.|$|E

5|$|Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The Jesuits, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> {{refused to}} do so, were {{expelled}} from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed {{the vast majority of}} its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their candombles. The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternize with them to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> can help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet.|$|E

At the time of the James family's departure, she was pregnant with a second son, Silas James, who was born at Hogg Creek, Iowa in June 1846. James, her husband Isaac, and Sylvester were part of the original group of Latter Day Saints to spend the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. They were also part of the Ira Eldredge company, the first Mormon pioneer company to enter the Salt Lake Valley in September 1847.

The pair were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> passed 35, but their fourth-wicket partnership of 166 was the highest in the match.
