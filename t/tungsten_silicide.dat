It is often used as a shunt over polysilicon lines to increase their conductivity and increase signal speed. <b>Tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> layers can be prepared by chemical vapor deposition, e.g. using monosilane or dichlorosilane with tungsten hexafluoride as source gases. The deposited film is non-stoichiometric, and requires annealing to convert to more conductive stoichiometric form. <b>Tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> is a replacement for earlier tungsten films. <b>Tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> is also used as a barrier layer between silicon and other metals, e.g. tungsten.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{films of}} electron-beam-vaporized silicon were {{deposited}} on fine-grained tungsten substrates under a pressure of about 1 x 10 to the - 10 th torr. Mass spectra from a quadrupole residual-gas analyzer {{were used to}} determine the partial pressure of 13 residual gases during each processing step. During separate silicon depositions, the atomically clean substrates were maintained at various temperatures between 400 and 780 C, and deposition rates were between 20 and 630 A min. Surface contamination and interdiffusion were monitored by in situ Auger electron spectrometry before and after cleaning, deposition, and annealing. Auger depth profiling, X-ray analysis, and SEM in the topographic and channeling modes were utilized to characterize the samples with respect to silicon-metal interface, interdiffusion, silicide formation, and grain size of silicon. The onset of silicide formation was found to occur at approximately 625 C. Above this temperature <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicides</b> were formed at a rate faster than the silicon deposition.

5000|$|Above {{the gate}} oxide {{is a thin}} {{electrode}} layer made of a conductor which can be aluminium, a highly doped silicon, a refractory metal such as <b>tungsten,</b> a <b>silicide</b> (TiSi, MoSi, TaSi or WSi) or a sandwich of these layers. This gate electrode is often called [...] "gate metal" [...] or [...] "gate conductor". The geometrical width of the gate conductor electrode (the direction transverse to current flow) is called the physical gate width. The physical gate width may be slightly different from the electrical channel width used to model the transistor as fringing electric fields can exert an influence on conductors that are not immediately below the gate.|$|R
50|$|A metal-semiconductor {{junction}} is formed between a metal and a semiconductor, creating a Schottky barrier (instead of a semiconductor-semiconductor junction as in conventional diodes). Typical metals used are molybdenum, platinum, chromium or <b>tungsten,</b> and certain <b>silicides</b> (e.g., palladium silicide and platinum silicide), whereas the semiconductor would typically be n-type silicon. The metal side {{acts as the}} anode, and n-type semiconductor acts as the cathode of the diode. This Schottky barrier results in both very fast switching and low forward voltage drop.|$|R
50|$|Chromium has {{excellent}} adhesion to many materials {{because of}} its reactivity. Its affinity for oxygen forms a thin stable oxide coat on the outer surface, creating a passivation layer which prevents further oxidation of the chromium, and of the underlying metal (if any), even in corrosive environments. Chromium plating on steel for automotive use involves three diffusion barrier layers—copper, nickel, then chromium—to provide long term durability where {{there will be many}} large temperature changes. If chromium is plated directly onto the steel, then their different thermal expansion coefficients will cause the chrome plating to peel off the steel. Nickel, Nichrome, tantalum, hafnium, niobium, zirconium, vanadium, and tungsten {{are a few of the}} metal combinations used to form diffusion barriers for specific applications. Conductive ceramics can be also used, such as tantalum nitride, indium oxide, copper <b>silicide,</b> <b>tungsten</b> nitride, and titanium nitride.|$|R

50|$|Polysilicon {{has many}} {{applications}} in VLSI manufacturing. One of its primary uses is as gate electrode material for MOS devices. A polysilicon gate's electrical conductivity {{may be increased}} by depositing a metal (such as tungsten) or a metal silicide (such as <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide)</b> over the gate. Polysilicon may also be employed as a resistor, a conductor, or as an ohmic contact for shallow junctions, with the desired electrical conductivity attained by doping the polysilicon material.|$|E
50|$|Nitrogen trifluoride {{is used in}} {{the plasma}} etching of silicon wafers. Today {{nitrogen}} trifluoride is predominantly employed in the cleaning of the PECVD chambers in the high-volume production of liquid-crystal displays and silicon-based thin-film solar cells. In these applications NF3 is initially broken down in situ by a plasma. The resulting fluorine atoms are the active cleaning agents that attack the polysilicon, silicon nitride and silicon oxide. Nitrogen trifluoride can be used as well with <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide,</b> and tungsten produced by CVD. NF3 has been considered as an environmentally preferable substitute for sulfur hexafluoride or perfluorocarbons such as hexafluoroethane.The process utilization of the chemicals applied in plasma processes is typically below 20%.Therefore some of the PFCs and also some of the NF3 always escape into the atmosphere. Modern gas abatement systems can decrease such emissions.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{tungsten}} and <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> were etched {{both within and}} downstream from a C 12 plasma discharge at 200 mtorr pressure and temperatures below 150 ~ When samples were positioned downstream from the discharge, etch-ing proceeded solely by chemical reaction of the film with chlorine atoms. Without a discharge, molecular chlorine did not etch tungsten or <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide.</b> Downstream and in-plasma tungsten etch rates were approximately equal at 110 ~ but the chlorine atom etch rate dropped more rapidly than the in-plasma etch rate as temperature decreased. The chemical re-action between chlorine atoms and the tungsten film was proportional to the gas phase C 1 atom mole fraction. A pretreat-ment consisting of either a dilute hydrofluoric a id dip or a short plasma etch cycle was necessary for atom etching of <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> films. The etch rates of <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> in C 12 plasmas were approximately {{an order of magnitude}} higher and less temperature s nsitive than those in the downstream (atom) configuration.

40|$|A {{technology}} is described for fabricating SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) on wafer bonded SOI substrates that incorporate buried <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> layers for collector resistance reduction or buried groundplanes for crosstalk suppression. The physical {{structure of the}} devices is characterized using cross-section TEM, and the electrical properties of the buried <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> layer are characterized using sheet resistance measurements {{as a function of}} bond temperature. Possible contamination issues associated with the buried <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> layer are investigated by measuring the collector/base reverse diode characteristics. A resistivity of 50 ohm. cm is obtained for the buried silicide layer for a bond anneal of 120 mins at 1000 C. Collector/base reverse diode characteristics show a voltage dependence of approximately V 1 / 2, indicating that the leakage current is due to Shockley-Read-Hall generation in the depletion region. Fitting of the current/voltage characteristics gives a generation lifetime of 90 ns, which is as expected for the collector doping of 7 x 1017 cm- 3. These results indicate that the buried <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> layer does not have a serious impact on junction leakage...|$|E

Typically the ske was 5 - & which {{is close to the}} size of the WF, molecule. The sticking probability of the film precursor was also examined by observing step coverage in a micron size trench. The sticking probability was about 0. 5 at 270 - 360 'C and dependent only slightly on temperature. The partial pressure ratio of SiH, to WF, was varied from 5 to 100, but the sticking probability did not change and the step coverage remained poor.

Contrary to some previous observations on niobium nitride (NbN) or <b>tungsten</b> <b>silicide</b> (WSi) detectors, we find that the energy-current relation is nonlinear in this range. Furthermore, thanks to the presence of a saturated detection efficiency over the whole range of wavelengths, we precisely quantify the shape of the curves.
