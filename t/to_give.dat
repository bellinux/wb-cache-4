40|$|Abstract: In the paper, we {{prove that}} reduced free {{products}} of unital AH algebras with respect <b>to</b> <b>given</b> faithful tracial states, {{in the sense}} of Voiculescu, are Blackadar and Kirhcberg’s MF algebras. We also show that the reduced free products of unital AH algebras with respect <b>to</b> <b>given</b> faithful tracial states, under mild conditions, are not quasidiagonal. Therefore we conclude, for a large class of AH algebras, the Brown-Douglas-Fillmore extension semigroups of the reduced free products of these AH algebras with respect <b>to</b> <b>given</b> faithful tracial states are not groups. Our result is based on Haagerup and Thorbjørsen’s work on the reduced C∗-algebras of free groups...|$|R
