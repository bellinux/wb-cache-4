Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged.

5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware <b>that</b> <b>Banks</b> had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E

However, such a strategy is costly. I find that market reactions to bank mergers involving recently targeted acquirers are significantly more negative than market reactions to mergers involving nontargeted acquirers. This is consistent with the market perceiving acquisitions by targeted banks as being generally defensive in nature. ...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{competition}} helps or hinders firms’ {{access to}} finance, {{particularly in the}} developing world, is in itself a much debated question in the economic literature and in policy circles. This paper considers the consequences of bank competition on credit constraints using firm level data covering 69 developing and emerging countries. In addition to the classical concentration measure, competition is assessed by computing three non-structural measures (Boone indicator, Lerner index and H-statistic). The results show <b>that</b> <b>bank</b> competition alleviates credit constraints and <b>that</b> <b>bank</b> concentration measure is not a robust predictor of a firm’s access to finance. The study highlights <b>that</b> <b>bank</b> competition not only leads to less severe loan approval decisions but also reduces borrower discouragement...|$|R
