5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. <b>The</b> <b>cursor</b> {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> over. For example, to move in a direction, <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking and dragging <b>the</b> <b>cursor,</b> the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse to move <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> on the screen. <b>The</b> <b>cursor</b> will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> {{to the top}} of the screen will reveal the player's inventory. Clicking an item and then clicking an object on the screen will use the item on that object or in that location. Some items such as keys are used automatically when clicked.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{stimulus-response}} compatibility of touchpad in pen-based user interface, we present <b>the</b> tilt <b>cursor,</b> i. e. a cursor dynamically reshapes itself to providing the 3 D orientation cue of pen. We also present two experiments that evaluate <b>the</b> tilt <b>cursorâ€™s</b> performance in circular menu selection and specific marking menu selection tasks. Results show that in a specific marking menu selection task, <b>the</b> tilt <b>cursor</b> significantly outperforms <b>the</b> shape-fixed arrow <b>cursor</b> and <b>the</b> live <b>cursor</b> [4]. In addition, results show that by using <b>the</b> tilt <b>cursor,</b> <b>the</b> response latencies for adjusting drawing directions are smaller than that by using the other two kinds of cursors...|$|R

50|$|The HTML Pair Matcher {{allows users}} to locate the {{matching}} open/close tag for the tag at <b>the</b> current <b>cursor</b> position. Unlike other HTML pair matchers, Emmet searches from <b>the</b> <b>cursor's</b> current position rather than scanning the document from the beginning.|$|R
5|$|The player {{character}} has {{three levels of}} strength. The strength level is indicated by <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> which will either be white, flashing yellow, or red. Strength will decrease after extreme actions or being attacked by the game's enemy, Scissorman, and recovers with time. When the character's life is being threatened, <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> will blink red, indicating panic mode. If the character is being chased, click points are only effective on objects that will make Scissorman retreat. In escape mode, actions do not lower strength and recovery is suspended. This mode stays active until Scissorman is somehow forced to retreat. If the player's strength reaches zero, then it is game over and the player must continue from the last room they entered with one level of strength.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
50|$|Circular slide rules come in {{two basic}} types, one with two cursors (left), and another with a free dish and one <b>cursor</b> (right). <b>The</b> dual <b>cursor</b> {{versions}} perform multiplication and division by holding a fast angle between <b>the</b> <b>cursors</b> as they are rotated around the dial. <b>The</b> onefold <b>cursor</b> version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.|$|R

5000|$|A {{wristwatch}} was <b>the</b> first wait <b>cursor</b> {{in early}} {{versions of the}} classic Mac OS. Apple's HyperCard first popularized animated cursors, including a black-and-white spinning quartered circle resembling a beach ball. <b>The</b> beach-ball <b>cursor</b> was also adopted to indicate running script code in the HyperTalk-like AppleScript. <b>The</b> <b>cursors</b> could be advanced by repeated HyperTalk invocations of [...] "set cursor to busy".|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled would change as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game would have seen the player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around a menu which appears after the mouse button is held down while <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on screen at all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using <b>the</b> <b>cursor,</b> the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around Battle of Austerlitz, in which the forces {{under the command of}} Napoleon must defend the Austrian village of Austerlitz from the invading Austro-Russian army, led by Tsar Alexander. In the game, the battle itself begins at 7am on 2 December 1805 and is played out in a series of turns. A turn lasts fifteen minutes and a total number of eight orders must be issued {{before the end of the}} turn. The player may choose either French or Russian forces to control throughout the game. In order to move a unit, the player must select them and point their <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> over the desired location; however, movement is restricted within a turn. At the start of a movement phase, the player can issue a command to one of their units. Orders include move, attack, defend, shell, stay in reserve, retreat and report.|$|E

5000|$|Acorn MOS {{implements}} {{character recognition}} so that text printed on {{screen in the}} system font can be selected with the arrow keys and input with the [...] key {{as though it was}} being typed. To activate screen editing the user moves <b>the</b> hardware <b>cursor</b> to <b>the</b> text to be read and the OS displays a second cursor in software at the original position. Pressing [...] copies one character from <b>the</b> hardware <b>cursor</b> to <b>the</b> software <b>cursor</b> and advances both, so that holding the key down copies a section of <b>the</b> text, <b>the</b> <b>cursors</b> wrapping around <b>the</b> vertical edges of the screen as necessary. If the screen scrolls during editing, <b>the</b> hardware <b>cursor's</b> position is adjusted to follow the text. The user can make changes to the text during the copy, and user-defined characters are recognised in graphics modes. Screen editing is terminated when [...] or [...] are pressed, which have their usual effects. Character recognition is made available to users in the API with a call to read the character at <b>the</b> current <b>cursor</b> position.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present DynaSpot, a new {{technique}} for acquiring targets based on <b>the</b> area <b>cursor.</b> DynaSpot couples <b>the</b> <b>cursor's</b> activation area with its speed, behaving like a point cursor at low speed or when motionless. This technique minimizes visual distraction and allows pointing anywhere in empty space without requiring an explicit mode switch, thus enabling users to perform common interactions such as region selections seamlessly. The results of our controlled experiments show that the performance of DynaSpot can be modeled by Fitts' law, and that DynaSpot significantly outperforms <b>the</b> point <b>cursor</b> and achieves, in most conditions, {{the same level of}} performance {{as one of the most}} promising techniques to date, <b>the</b> Bubble <b>cursor...</b>|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with <b>the</b> <b>cursor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. <b>The</b> <b>cursor</b> changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
50|$|As an alternative, the PL/SQL {{programmer}} can pre-define <b>the</b> <b>cursor's</b> SELECT-statement {{in advance}} to (for example) allow re-use or make the code more understandable (especially useful {{in the case of}} long or complex queries).|$|R
30|$|The {{choice of}} a cursor path is {{important}} because it imposes requirements on the user and determines the time needed to select an item. For example, accessing a key on the keyboard for <b>the</b> linear <b>cursor</b> path requires only one selection from the user, while <b>the</b> binary <b>cursor</b> path requires six selections. If triggering the switch device is difficult for the user, it might be best to use a cursor path that needs few selections. On the other hand, <b>the</b> linear <b>cursor</b> path {{will take a long time}} to reach items at the end of <b>the</b> path (64 <b>cursor</b> steps for <b>the</b> final item), while <b>the</b> binary <b>cursor</b> path takes no more than 12 cursor steps. Several studies have explored the costs and benefits of different types of cursor paths (e.g., Koester & Simpson, 2014).|$|R
50|$|Windows 8 {{introduced}} a new flat wait <b>cursor.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>cursor</b> is light blue on dark blue and removes the fade and the particles from the animated part.|$|R
25|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> to {{different}} positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> {{to the beginning of}} the line where <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is located; the End key puts <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> at the end of the line. The Tab key advances <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> to the next tab stop.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, one {{can imagine}} {{directly}} generating the entire infinite Fibonacci word by the following process: start with a cursor pointing to the single digit 0. Then, at each step, if <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is pointing to a 0, append 1, 0 {{to the end of}} the word, and if <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is pointing to a 1, append 0 {{to the end of the}} word. In either case, complete the step by moving <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> one position to the right.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> {{hovers over}} a link, {{depending}} on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.|$|E

25|$|On iPad, a two-finger {{drag on the}} {{keyboard}} moves <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> freely like a traditional trackpad, making positioning <b>the</b> <b>cursor</b> and selecting text easier. The keyboard-to-trackpad feature is also extended to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, in which users can 3D Touch (force press) {{the keyboard}} to enable the trackpad. Also on the iPad, a shortcut bar has been added for cut, copy, paste, undo and redo functions, and folders display 16 apps per page in a 4-by-4 arrangement, compared to 9 on the iPhone, allowing for an increased total of 240 apps in a single folder.|$|E
