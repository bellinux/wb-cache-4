Pellets solidify in an induration <b>tunnel</b> or <b>furnace</b> at 1280 °C.

Two reducing gases (derived from cracking natural gas or methane, consisting of Co and H2) are injected into the furnace, combine with oxygen from the pellets resulting in CO2 + H2O. Without oxygen, pellets become sponge irons. After screening, sponge irons are transferred to the Steel Plant. Sponge irons with a diameter less than 5 mm go to the briquet unit to produce briquets (diameter above 25 mm). Then, they are transferred to the Steel Plant with the sponge iron.|$|R

Three samples {{were taken from}} the as-cast slab prior to <b>tunnel</b> <b>furnace,</b> intermediate bar after stand F 2 and the hot band, respectively. In the as-cast slab, the average austenite grain size is 654 µm with a large size range from 150 to 2000 µm. In the intermediate bar after stand F 2, the austenite grains are remarkably refined, but are heterogenous due to the incomplete recrystallization, which are in the size range of 23 to 116 µm. In the hot band is mainly non-polygonal ferrite. Microstructural heterogeneity exists in the hot band. It is attributed to the heterogeneous austenite grain size in the intermediate bar and the less rolling reduction after stand F 2. With regards to precipitation, cubic TiN and fine precipitates less than 20 nm are commonly observed in the as-cast slab and the intermediate bar. Some complex (Ti,Nb) (C,N) precipitates with a slightly larger size also exist. In the hot band, most particles are complex (Ti,Nb) (C,N) precipitates, in a shape of irregular or cruciform. The fine precipitates which can strengthen the ferrite matrix are seldom seen. These results are in good agreement with the size distribution of the precipitates determined using small angle X-ray scattering method.

40|$|Operational {{radioactive}} waste is generated during routine operation of NPP. Process waste is mainly generated by treatment {{of water from}} reactor or ancillaries including spent fuel storage pools and some decontamination operations. Typical process wastes of pressurized water reactors (PWR or WWER) are borated water concentrates, whereas typical process wastes of boiling and RBMK type reactors are water concentrates with no boron content. NPP operational wastes are classified as low and intermediate level waste (LILW). NPP operational waste must be solidified {{in order to ensure}} safe conditions of storage and disposal. Currently the most promising solidification method for this waste is the vitrification technology. Vitrification of NPP operational waste is a relative new option being developed for last years. Nevertheless there is already accumulated operational experience on vitrifying low and intermediate level waste in Russian Federation at Moscow SIA ''Radon'' vitrification plant. This plant uses the most advanced type induction high frequency melters that facilitate the melting process and significantly reduce the generation of secondary waste and henceforth the overall cost. The plant was put into operation by the end of 1999. It has three operating cold crucible melters with the overall capacity up to 75 kg/h. The vitrification technology comprises a few stages, starting with evaporation of excess water from liquid {{radioactive waste}}, followed by batch preparation, glass melting, and ending with vitrified waste blocks and some relative small amounts of secondary waste. First of all since the original waste contain as main component water, this water is removed from waste through evaporation. Then the remaining salt concentrate is mixed with necessary technological additives, thus a glass-forming batch is formed. The batch is fed into melters where the glass melting occurs. From here there are two streams: one is the glass melt containing the most part of radioactivity and second is the off gas flow, which contains off gaseous and aerosol airborne. The melt glass is fed into containers, which are slowly cooled in an annealing <b>tunnel</b> <b>furnace</b> to avoid accumulation of mechanical stresses in the glass. Containers with glass are the final processing product containing the overwhelming part of waste contaminants. The second stream from melter is directed to gas purification system, which is a rather complex system taking into account the necessity to remove from off gas not only radionuclides but also the chemical contaminants. Operation of this purification system leads to generation of a small amount of secondary waste. This waste stream slightly contaminated with volatilized radionuclides is recycled in the same technological scheme. As a result only non-radioactive materials are produced. They are either discharged into environment or reused. Based on the experience gained during operation of vitrification plant one can conclude on high efficiency achieved through vitrification method. Another significant argument on vitrifying NPP operational waste is the minimal impact of vitrified radioactive waste onto environment. Solidified waste shall be disposed of into a near surface disposal facility. Waste forms disposed of in a near-surface wet repository eventually come into contact with groundwater. Engineered structures used or designed to prevent or postpone such contact and the subsequent radionuclide release are complex and often too expensive. Vitrification technologies provide waste forms with excellent resistance to corrosion and gave the basic possibility of maximal simplification of engineered barrier systems. The most simple disposal option is to locate the vitrified waste form packages directly into earthen trenches provided the host rock has the necessary sorption and confinement properties. Such an approach will significantly make simpler the disposal facilities thus contributing both to enhancing safety and economic al efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of heat treatment process on the microstructure and mechanical properties, and the distortion of a low-pressure die-cast AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 alloy is reported. This work {{is aimed at}} optimizing the whole heat treatment process, including solution heat treatment, quenching and artificial ageing, of A 356 alloy wheels, produced by low pressure die casting. In particular, the optimization process is focused on reducing time and temperature of solution and ageing heat treatments, and on selecting the right quenching medium, reducing the distortion of A 356 alloy 17 -in and 18 -in wheels and obtaining the required mechanical properties. The time and temperature of solution treatment are normally chosen to dissolve coarse β-Mg 2 Si phase coming from the solidification process, especially where the solidification rate is slow as in the thickest zones of wheel, e. g. the hub and the spoke regions. Generally, the time required is about 45 minutes at the temperature of 540 °C, which is the typical solution temperature used for A 356 -type alloy. More time is however required at this temperature to change the morphology of eutectic silicon particles. This is aimed to improve the mechanical properties, especially ductility and fatigue properties, of wheels after further artificial ageing. The solutionising temperature is here selected to reduce {{the time of the}} heat treatment and to avoid any type of incipient melting of the material within an industrial <b>tunnel</b> <b>furnace.</b> The quenching is the most critical step in the sequence of heat-treating operations. The objective of quenching is to preserve the solid solution formed at the solution heat-treating temperature, by rapidly cooling to some lower temperature, usually near the room temperature. The most rapid quench rate, giving the best mechanical properties, can also cause unacceptable amounts of distortion or cracking in components. This is particularly true for aluminium wheels where the different thickness throughout the casting can produce distortion higher than 2 - 3 mm, critics for subsequent machining operations. The optimization process is here focused on the quenching rate, which is varied by changing the temperature of the quenchant, {{in order to reduce the}} wheels’ distortion and to guarantee the appropriated supersaturation level of atoms for subsequent ageing treatment. Therefore, the temperature of forced water, used as quenchant, has been varied in the range of 50 to 95 °C, and the distortion level and the hardness of the wheels systematically measured. A temperature of 95 °C is observed to be the optimum solution, but useless from an industrial point of view. The extreme vapour produced by the boiling water can compromise the automatism for handling of wheels and delay too much the cooling of the wheels after solutioning. Therefore, the best compromise between distortion and mechanical properties and productivity has been revealed to be at a temperature of 75 °C. The time and temperature of ageing are considered in the present work in order to reach an underageing temper of the material, which is typical for the manufacture of wheels to improve impact and fatigue properties. The {{influence of}} the different painting processes, generally carried out at a temperature of 180 ÷ 190 °C for several minutes after ageing and subsequent machining operations, have to be considered to determine the final mechanical properties. These temperatures are typical temperature for ageing treatment of cast aluminium alloys, such as the A 356 -type alloys. Therefore, the present study takes into account the painting temperatures and times to optimize the ageing treatment of the wheels, reaching the desired mechanical properties. This study develop an optimization approach of the whole heat treatment process of cast aluminium alloy wheels. The work evidences the typical problems and targets of wheels’ producers, suggesting an integrated approach to improve the productivity and the quality of castings. Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the microstructural changes occurring during heat treatment; while hardness and tensile testing measurements have been carried out to monitor the evolution of the mechanical properties after each step of T 6 heat treatment...|$|E
