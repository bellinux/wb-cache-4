5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E
5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
60|$|They {{said they}} were very sorry, {{but that was just}} the difficulty. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> it up.|$|R

60|$|Then {{they all}} went home in such an ecstasy of delight that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>get</b> a wink of sleep.|$|R
5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> their hands on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard {{attempt to}} solve their Comic-Con problem by {{illegally}} buying scalped tickets. After arranging for a scalper to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> charged for petty theft, then have to disclose the crime in the future. When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting {{players of the}} game to visit one of four cinemas where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{a chance to play}} Halo 2 before its release and collect a commemorative DVD.|$|E
60|$|Then Caleb {{looked around}} and {{observed}} that the outer gate was fastened, so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> out of the yard.|$|R

5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{to the end of}} the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} passed, and presently night fell. There was no food of {{any kind}} in the boat. The men chewed their quids, but the two officers could not indulge in that relief. At night Nelson and Will wrapped themselves in their boat-cloaks and made themselves as comfortable as <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>getting</b> uneasy snatches of sleep. Morning broke {{and there was no}} change; a white wall of fog rose all round the boat.|$|R
50|$|Tate and Gordon were {{divorced}} in 1945 and remarried in 1946. Though devoted {{to one another}} for life, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> along and later divorced again.|$|R

5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the Union line, three regiments of Cutler's brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into {{position}} on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped {{the right of}} Cutler's, making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered Cutler's regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. Cutler's 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men. Some of Davis's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge. This defocused the Confederate effort north of the pike.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{claimed that}} the stated [...] "minimum requirements" [...] were set too low and that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> barely <b>get</b> the game to run on a {{significantly}} more powerful system.|$|R
60|$|But {{as soon as}} {{they turned}} the boat's head towards the shore, and hauled in the sheet as tightly as <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>they</b> found that, try as <b>they</b> would, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> her to lie her course.|$|R
5000|$|The Brook would {{frequently}} flood Waltham Street, Lexington, in the Colonial days. The {{residents of}} the Southwest part of town would complain that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> to [...] "meeting," [...] or church.|$|R
5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night in when he is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment Jim Reardon, Moore, {{and a few other}} animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One of the strip clubs Homer and Bart visit when they are trying to find Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> inspiration for the interior design of the strip club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
60|$|But {{what was}} their astonishment {{in the morning at}} finding that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> out of the place! There was no door. All the entrances had vanished, even to any {{feasible}} window.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{here are}} lots of proud sisters ready to cut off their toes and heels if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> on such a small slipper," [...] added another young Mygar, enjoying the fun immensely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, if you wish," [...] was the reply. And {{then the}} amount was fixed, and the prisoners {{sent out a}} messenger, to see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> {{somebody}} to go on their bail bonds.|$|R
5|$|During a brief {{concert at}} the Tool and Die club in San Francisco, Dead Kennedys {{frontman}} and Alternative Tentacles overseer Jello Biafra witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan. Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> someone to lend them studio time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss). However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position {{was taken over by}} Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated. The last of these, King Coffey (born Jeffrey Coffey), is still with the band to this day.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to other jobs. Poverty deepened {{in areas of the}} city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2002 Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's Smallville: Dragon, {{about an}} ex-convict who assumes the abilities and {{appearance of a}} dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives {{him to try to}} kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' Flight, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother. Flight (like See No Evil) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published Animal Rage by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith's Whodunit, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.|$|E
