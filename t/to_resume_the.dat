5|$|Charles finally {{allowed his}} sister to resign. She {{formally}} announced her decision on 24 September 1555 and dismissed her household on 1 October. On 25 October, her authority {{was transferred to}} Philip, who, despite his personal dislike of his aunt, tried to convince her <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> post. After another quarrel with Philip, Mary retired to Turnhout. She remained in the Netherlands one more year.|$|E
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, {{it proved to}} be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at the urging of Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} season, Salo signed another two-year {{contract with the}} Canucks at $1.5 million per season. He was limited to 59 games in the subsequent 2005–06 season, suffering a shoulder injury with the Finnish national team during the 2006 Winter Olympics, colliding with a teammate during a line change. He recorded 10 goals and 33 points with the Canucks, second among team defencemen in scoring. His 23 assists were also a career-high.|$|E

5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E
5|$|Following von Spee's {{withdrawal}} from the Pacific, Australia was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 to join with several Japanese cruisers off Mexico <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> hunt for the German cruisers. By this time, the German squadron had {{made its way to}} the South Atlantic, and in early December was destroyed by a British squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Australia was sent to join the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron at Rosyth, Scotland, and was made flagship of the squadron after a short refit.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{response}} to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Yatsenyuk announced his intentions <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> bid for NATO integration on 29 August 2014, and in December 2014, Ukraine's parliament voted to drop the non-aligned status that it adopted in 2010. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO membership has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll. Previous polls had shown that the decline in opposition to membership was linked to the ongoing Russian intervention.|$|E

60|$|Lucilla had {{not heard}} him. She was still pondering, with the same perplexed face.

5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in the past, are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E
5|$|The American counteroffensive of 3–5 September west of Yongsan {{resulted}} {{in one of}} the bloodiest and most terrifying debacles of the war for a North Korean division, according to historians. Even though remnants of the NK 9th Division, supported by the low strength NK 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on 6 September, the division's offensive strength had been spent {{at the end of the}} American counterattack. The NK 9th and 4th divisions were not able <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{opened the}} gates of the city to the Isaurian, {{allowing}} the deposed emperor <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> throne. Basiliscus fled to sanctuary in a church, but he was betrayed by Acacius and surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus, his wife Aelia Zenonis and his son Marcus were sent to a fortress in Cappadocia, where Zeno had them enclosed in a dry cistern, to die from exposure.|$|E

Rick and Daryl return unsuccessfully, {{and the group}} spends the night <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> search the next day. Carol berates Rick for losing Sophia.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May. Beresford's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue, but was able <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> investment of Badajoz. Despite Soult's failure to relieve the town, the battle had little strategic effect on the war. Just one month later, in June 1811, the Allies were forced to abandon their siege by {{the approach of the}} reconstituted French Armies of Portugal and Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|Wintry weather made {{subsequent}} {{attempts to}} recover the dead difficult; four bodies were never found. Transcontinental traffic was rerouted temporarily onto Canadian Pacific tracks through Calgary as the CNR attempted to clear the tracks. The work was hampered by an explosion and fire that broke out {{on the morning of}} November 22, consuming many of the wrecked cars and likely the missing bodies, and the wreckage was cleared by that evening, allowing traffic <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> following day.|$|E

5|$|Zacharie's death {{threatened}} {{to disrupt the}} project, but King Louis XVI of France was personally interested, and Zacharie's oldest son, Guillaume, was allowed <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> work. On 14 December 1771, new letters patent were given to Guillaume and his partners, replacing the earlier ones. Under the new terms, all the land needed could be expropriated including two toises, or , of land on either side for tow paths. The builder could take materials wherever they could be found.|$|E
5|$|At that point, the 29th Brigade was {{committed}} to the fighting again, moving to the Mivo River, where it took over the advance from the 15th Brigade. As the 15th Battalion advanced to relieve the 57th/60th Battalion, it clashed with Japanese units and, on 3 July, as a company from the 47th Battalion came under heavy attack, one the 15th Battalion's platoons was dispatched with two tanks in support to provide assistance. Heavy fighting continued throughout the afternoon following their arrival, during which at least 20 Japanese were killed. The 15th Battalion occupied a position around Sisikatekori and along Killen's Track, in the southern sector of the brigade's area, while the Australians made preparations <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> advance towards the Buin stronghold. The most-forward battalion, on 6 July it was subjected to heavy attacks as the Japanese sought to infiltrate the Australian forward positions and cut their lines of communication. As {{a result of these}} attacks, the plan to advance was cancelled temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives in an effort <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed {{in the fall of}} 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E

5|$|Both Major General Wayne C. Smith and Lieutenant General Chung Il-kwon, {{commanders of}} the US 7th Infantry Division and the ROK 2nd Infantry Division respectively, {{relieved}} exhausted battalions daily to maintain troops' morale. On October 15, Smith ordered the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment {{to be placed}} {{under the command of}} Colonel Moses <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> attack on Triangle Hill. Similarly, Chung Il-kwon replaced the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment with the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment. Later that day both US battalions captured Hill 598 and Sandy Ridge after meeting only light resistance, but the Chinese tunnels and a counterattack by the PVA 135th Regiment prevented the Americans from advancing towards Pike's Peak and Jane Russell Hill. The South Koreans, on the other hand, were thrown back by a Chinese counterattack after recapturing Sniper Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{called a}} special session in March 1897 <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> balloting for senator. He {{appointed}} Andrew T.

The Republicans continued supporting Hunter, Free Silver Democrats still backed Blackburn, and Gold Democrats nominated businessman Henry L. Martin of Woodford County. When continued deadlock between Hunter and Blackburn ensued, Hunter withdrew his name from consideration. Republicans nominated St. John Boyle, but the gridlock continued unabated. After several ballots, Boyle also withdrew, and Republicans put forth lawyer and State senator William Joseph Deboe in his place. Deboe was elected on the 112th ballot, becoming the first Republican senator from the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance <b>to</b> <b>resume,</b> <b>the</b> Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E
