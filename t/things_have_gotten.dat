50|$|It's {{the summer}} of 1977 and all Nora López {{wants to do is}} get old enough to move out and live on her own. Her home life is difficult, as her father left home when she was little and will only {{occasionally}} send them money to cover the family's rent - something made more vital when Nora's mother begins to gain fewer hours at work. Nora's younger brother Hector is violent and abusive, as he will frequently beat both Nora and their mother whenever he gets angry. Her mother is dismissive of Hector's abuse as she feels that it is just a phase and always tries to get Nora to calm Hector, to little effect. Nora is loath to let her friends know exactly how bad <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> at home, so Nora decides to hide her bruises and poverty. Things seem to get better when a cute college boy named Pablo begins working with her at the deli and they begin dating.|$|E

Amane and Hyoue sense the evil spirit, saving Takako from its clutches, and winning a new, devoted friend. Happy to have a second chance to befriend another outcast, Takako (nicknamed Ateko) often {{journeys}} with Amane and Hyoue on their adventures, even going to their home island to make sure her friends are okay. She often sticks her nose in places where they don't belong, but always at the sake of making sure everyone is okay. Since she is a normal teenage, she often doesn't understand the issues with Amane and her family or why Amane and Hyoue cannot be together.

Three final songs were recorded before Aaron went back to the U.S. for good and Yesterday's End (containing mostly unreleased, but also some out of print material) was released late September 1998 and can be seen as the band's farewell album to all their fans.|$|R

He joined up with cowboy Tom Harris, who had organised {{what was called the}} [...] "Get Even Cattle Company", which was taking to the practice of placing their own brand on already branded calves owned by the ranchers. Bogan was by this time going by the name Bill Gatlin, and he registered two brands in his own name.

The Israelites complain to Moses and Aaron that they have now made things worse for them, and Moses in turn complains to God that every time he has gone to Pharaoh {{on behalf of the}} Israelites, <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> worse for them.

You can always tell on Grimm how bad <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> by the degree to which these officers of the law disregard the law part of the equation, and it's jettisoned right away as the Trubel-severed Verrat head winds up in Wu's car trunk. Here though, it's a mix of enforcing the law and subverting it, as they use the head and Adalind's cooperation to set Kenneth (or rather Kenneth Alun Goderich Bowes-Lyon, according to his passport) up as a creepy head-taking killer. It's interesting to see the case-of-the-week beats playing out in a different framework, even as you wonder why no officers are able to connect Adalind to the dozen or so crimes she's been connected to {{since the start of the}} series." ...|$|E

They include the Prospector, the President, the Broker and the Baron, and they are planning to dig up Paris to get at the oil which they believe lies beneath its streets. Their nefarious plans come to the attention of Countess Aurelia, the benignly eccentric madwoman of the title. She is an aging idealist who sees the world as happy and beautiful. But, advised by her associate, the Ragpicker, who is a bit more worldly than the Countess, she soon comes to realize that the world might well be ruined by these evil men—men who seek only wealth and power. These people have taken over Paris. [...] "They run everything, they corrupt everything," [...] says the Ragpicker.

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} {{theories about the}} meaning of the book’s title. Michael Gorra writes that it refers to the child safety gates that people put at the top of staircases to keep children from toppling down the stairs. Michiko Kakutani, on the other hand, believes the book’s title refers to a song Tassie wrote which includes the lyric [...] "I’d climb up that staircase/past lions and bears,/but it’s locked/at the foot of the stairs." [...] However, there is also a gate {{at the front of the}} Brink house that takes on symbolic significance as Tassie first approaches the house. The gate is slightly off its hinges, and Tassie notes mentally [...] "it should have communicated itself as something else: someone’s ill-disguised decrepitude, items not cared for properly but fixed repeatedly in a make-do fashion, needful <b>things</b> <b>having</b> <b>gotten</b> away from their caregiver." ...|$|R

50|$|Back at Balandor <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{worse as}} Grazel and Shapur in their knight forms {{alongside}} their army have begun attacking {{the city in}} hopes of weakening them. Leonard, knowing this and the fact he cannot use his knight no longer without having part of himself damaged, still goes against them to a point as him to become unconscious. Yulie believes {{the help of the}} Moon Maiden hidden inside Father Yggdra will help but requires the Ark of the knight to become its pact maker. Searching through the tunnels she eventually finds it and becomes the soul of the last knight and appears before the battlefield in earnest using her bow to destroy all the enemy ships and damage the Sun King and Black Knight with help. Defeated, the team regroups and begins to set for the Redhorn Isle, location of the Magi and Yshrenian army. Knowing they cannot use their knights unless desperate for they must save their strength for Grazel and Shapur they reside in the flying ship whilst the army of Balandor sails alongside the Windwalkers who pay their debt in the war. On the ship Queen Cisna prepares all of Balandor for attack, although in battle a majority of the Balandor knights are destroyed, and it is by the help of Faria that they are able to turn the tides and begin winning the new war.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the album}} was {{released}} in more traditional formats, The Next Four Years {{was meant to be}} experienced as a boxed set. The boxed-set version was limited to 1,000 copies that were hand-assembled by the members of United Nations, and features all 11 tracks found on other formats, but split between a cassette tape, a 10" [...] vinyl record and two 7" [...] vinyl records. The cover art of the boxed set features fake news articles and the cassette tape was wrapped in a copy of the actual cease-and-desist letter sent by the actual United Nations. As a boxed set, the series of different formats are meant be a concept album that illustrates and critiques the evolution of the band members themselves from an underground basement act to an experimental. United Nations vocalist Geoff Rickly explained: [...] "This record is more developed and mature because we decided that the best form of critique isn't political or punk critique; it's critiquing ourselves. So the record is a lot more personal—a lists of all the ways we've failed all the things we once believed in, and accepting the status quo of how band <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten.</b> It's sort of examining our own level of privilege. The box set {{is supposed to be a}} fake mythology of the band. The cassette is the first demo—the band at its most basic—then there's the two 7-inches, and the 10-inch is where we get into our pretentious phase of trying to sound like Godspeed [...]" ...|$|E

Even though {{not knowing how to}} deal with the situation they all agree that they need to find Timo. This puts Jan on a search with Ricardo, where Jan tells him that he loves Julia. The two end up fighting and Jan falling over a cliff, holding onto a rock. Jan begs Ricardo for help, but he sees a chance to get rid of the man he hates. Timo arrives to the scene and tries to help Jan, eventually bringing Ricardo to help too. After Jan has been rescued, Clarissa and Arno want to talk with their children. But instead of realizing that <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> too far, Jan finally wants a life with Julia and asks her to go away with him. Arno is outraged and wants his son to be responsible, while Clarissa seems helpless in this situation. Jan tells his parents that he and Julia never really were brother and sister. He tries to make them understand that they see each other as a man and a woman who love each other and can't do anything about that. Arno asks Jan what he expects and how a life with his sister would be possible in his mind, considering the two have children of their own now to think of. Jan feels that Arno is only involving Timo and Leonie, because he couldn't live with the possibility. Jan tells his father that he once disappeared out of his life and could do this again. In the meanwhile, Julia doesn't know what to do as Timo threatens her if she chooses Jan she would be out of his life for good.|$|E
