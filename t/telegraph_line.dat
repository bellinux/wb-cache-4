5|$|William Russell, {{senior partner}} of 'Russell, Majors, and Waddell' {{and one of}} the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential {{election}} as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern <b>telegraph</b> <b>line)</b> with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western <b>telegraph</b> <b>line).</b> California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.|$|E
5|$|Three decades later, the East–West <b>Telegraph</b> <b>line</b> was installed. Constructed between 1875 and 1877, it {{followed}} the same route across the Nullarbor and along the Great Australian Bight, after John Forrest retraced Eyre's route in 1870 and confirmed its suitability. Repeater stations were installed at Port Lincoln, Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Fowlers Bay, Eucla, Israelite Bay, Esperance, and Bremer Bay. Stations were later added at Franklin Harbour (Cowell) in 1885, Yardea in 1896, and Balladonia in 1897.|$|E
25|$|After the First Transcontinental Railroad was {{completed}} in 1869, <b>telegraph</b> <b>lines</b> usually followed the railroad tracks as the required relay stations and <b>telegraph</b> <b>lines</b> were much easier to maintain alongside the tracks. <b>Telegraph</b> <b>lines</b> to unpopulated areas were largely abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|Time was not {{standardized}} {{across the}} United States until about 1883. In 1865, each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors. To communicate easily {{up and down}} the line, the railroads built <b>telegraph</b> <b>lines</b> alongside the railroad. These lines eventually superseded the original First Transcontinental Telegraph which followed much of the Mormon Trail up the North Platte River and across the very thinly populated Central Nevada Route through central Utah and Nevada. The <b>telegraph</b> <b>lines</b> along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain. [...] Many of the original <b>telegraph</b> <b>lines</b> were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad <b>telegraph</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 13, 1863, a brigade of 870 Union soldiers departed their base camp located a few miles upriver (east) of Charleston, West Virginia. Their orders, which came from General Eliakim P. Scammon, were to disable the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. <b>Telegraph</b> <b>line</b> strung along the railroad line was also a target. If circumstances allowed, nearby lead and salt mines would also be objectives. Although the railroad, lead mine, and salt mine were obvious targets, communications sent by General Scammon were in code. Thus, exact details of the plan were known by few.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West <b>Telegraph</b> <b>line</b> in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway was called for, but the federal government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was trafficable by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E

5|$|In mid-October 1905, Seeadler sent {{a landing}} party ashore at Samanga {{to protect the}} coastal <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> there. By mid-December, she had {{returned}} to Dar es Salaam, before proceeding to Kilwa on 17 January 1906. The cruiser was back in Dar es Salaam on 24 January. Another overhaul at Cape Town followed from 10 February to 16 March. By this time, the situation in East Africa had calmed, and the light cruiser , which had also been sent to suppress the Maji-Maji uprising, {{was sent back to}} Germany. Seeadler nevertheless remained in the region, and was formally assigned to the East Africa Station in early 1907. In October 1907, then-Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Hugo Meurer served as the ship's commanding officer. He would hold the position until June 1909.|$|E
5|$|Madras {{was linked}} {{to the rest of the}} world through {{telegraphs}} in 1853 and a civilian telegraph service was introduced on 1 February 1855. Soon afterwards, telegraph lines linked Madras and Ootacamund with other cities in India. A Telegraph department was set up in 1854, with a Deputy Superintendent stationed in Madras city. The Colombo-Talaimannar <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> established in 1858, was extended to Madras in 1882, thereby connecting the city with Ceylon. Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881, the first telephone exchange with 17 connections was established at Errabalu Street in Madras. A wireless telgraphy service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936, the Indo-Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon.|$|E

The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were obscured by the effect of a mirage and dust clouds.|$|E

5|$|The forward {{troops of}} the German and Ottoman rearguard, which held a front of about , were driven back to Bir el Abd by the New Zealanders. At this time, the attackers {{appeared}} likely to succeed, as they had firmly established themselves across the <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> and the old caravan road, supported by the Somerset and Leicester batteries. But the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was, and at 09:00 advanced out of their trenches to counterattack. This aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the Somerset Battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns. The subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position, and on the flanks the light horse were also held up. The German and Ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards {{a gap between the}} New Zealanders and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, but the 5th Light Horse Regiment covered the gap, and the German and Ottoman advance was halted.|$|E
5|$|The Union force {{suffered}} significant losses. The Union commander, Colonel Toland, was killed. The severely wounded cavalry commander, Colonel William H. Powell, {{was left}} to die and became a prisoner of the Confederates. (Powell was also second {{in command of the}} entire brigade.) Additional officers and enlisted men were killed, wounded, or missing. The Union after action report listed a total of 86 men killed, wounded, missing, or taken prisoner during the entire expedition—although Confederate leadership believed the Union casualties were much higher. (The entire expedition includes the trips to and from Wytheville.) Approximately 300 horses were lost (killed, wounded, or injured) by the brigade during the raid and retreat—including an estimated 80 killed on the streets of Wytheville. Despite significant losses, the Union brigade was eventually able to secure the town. However, the victory was costly, and the northerners retreated less than 24 hours after entering the small community. A group of soldiers and civilians, less than one third the size of the Union force they opposed, prevented a brigade from destroying vital assets of the Confederacy—a railroad line, <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> along the railroad, a lead mine, and possibly a salt mine. After the conflict, Union infantry leaders were critical of the Union cavalry's performance, and men from the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership's tactics.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 09:00 on 11 May, a {{small body}} of cavalry, {{followed by a}} larger body in the distance, was seen approaching Delhi along the road between that city and Meerut. The East India Company employees immediately noted that this was unusual, and the senior military officers present within the city attempted to contact Meerut by telegraph to enquire about the approaching troops, but the <b>telegraph</b> <b>line</b> between Delhi and Meerut {{appeared to have been}} cut. The 54th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, one of three Bengal Native Infantry regiments garrisoned within Delhi's Red Fort, was ordered to intercept them. A party of East India Company civil servants went to secure the fort's Calcutta Gate, but when they arrived they found that troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry had already taken control of it. A struggle ensued which led to the death of a cavalry trooper and a civilian. A small group of troopers from the regiment headed toward the city's jail and released the inmates, meeting with no resistance. The main body of the regiment then arrived, joining up with the party at the Calcutta Gate, and then collectively they entered the fort and attacked the civilians within. A small group from the advance party gained access to the private courtyard of Bahadur Shah II and told him that he should take command of them. The regiment spread out throughout the fort and the city, and was eventually joined in mutiny by the forces of Bahadur Shah II and members of the Bengal Native Infantry who were based within the fort; a widespread outbreak of looting, burning of buildings and murder of East India Company employees and civilian shopkeepers took place, and the Indian Mutiny began in earnest. The mutineers of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained at Delhi until the breaking of the Siege of Delhi in September 1857. They withdrew first to Lucknow, then later to Nepal, where the majority of the men died through combat, disease or starvation. Those that eventually managed to make their way back to their homes found themselves shunned by their communities for their part in the mutiny. The regiment itself, in common with every other regiment of Bengal Light Cavalry, was disbanded {{at the end of the}} Indian Mutiny.|$|E
