40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the shamanism and with <b>the</b> <b>initiations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shamans. In the first part the author {{describes}} these initiations at large and evokes the phenomenon of shamanism in general. The following part pursues <b>the</b> descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiations</b> in different places in the world. The selected cultures in this thesis present the traditional communities where the shamanism has a fixed position in their social structure. The author approaches <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> shaman in <b>the</b> five ethnic groups of the three continents. He starts with {{the description of the}} three Siberian ethnic groups, than he continues with the North American one and he finishes with the South American one. The author emphasizes the way of the election of shaman, how and when these elections are created, and <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> ? he focuses on the visions and the rituals. In the final part of the thesis the author compares <b>the</b> <b>initiations</b> <b>of</b> particular cultures. These comparisons are based on the social relations between the shaman and the community...|$|R

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> the {{strategic}} aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease {{its support of}} the southern insurgency.

After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> mass <b>of</b> Escherichia coli is constant and independent of growth rate, and therefore {{is an important}} parameter in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> DNA replication. We have used flow cytometry to measure <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> mass <b>of</b> E. coli K- 12 cells {{as a function of}} growth rate. <b>The</b> average <b>initiation</b> mass was determined by two methods: (i) from a mathematical relationship between average cell mass, cell age at <b>initiation</b> and number <b>of</b> origins present in the cells, and (ii) directly from the cell mass distribution. The light scattering signal from individual cells and the protein content per cell were employed as measures <b>of</b> cell mass. <b>The</b> <b>initiation</b> mass was found to increase monotonically with decreasing growth rate, being 1. 6 times higher (light scattering) or 2. 1 times higher (protein content) at 0. 3 than at 2. 5 doublings per hour. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> mass is dependent on growth rate. This finding indicates that the control for timing <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> is not governed by a direct connection between mass accumulation and <b>the</b> molecule(s) determining <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> replication...|$|R

5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa.

5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate.

5|$|Freemasons, {{members of}} a European fraternal {{organization}} that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century, developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times. Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions. After Sethos was published, several Masonic lodges developed rites based on those in the novel. Late in the century, Masonic writers, still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story, used the obvious resemblance between their rites and <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry's supposedly ancient origin. Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson's Egyptian initiation: trials by three or four elements, often taking place under the pyramids. The best-known of these works is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 1791 opera The Magic Flute, in which the main character, Tamino, undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris.|$|E
