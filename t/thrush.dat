5|$|The mistle <b>thrush</b> is much larger, paler and longer-tailed {{than the}} {{sympatric}} song <b>thrush.</b> In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} mistle <b>thrush,</b> but the plainâ€“backed <b>thrush</b> lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed <b>thrush</b> has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's <b>thrush,</b> but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the song thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle <b>thrush</b> (T. viscivorus) and Chinese <b>thrush</b> (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European <b>thrush</b> species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|E
5|$|The most similar European <b>thrush</b> {{species is}} the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird {{has a strong}} white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The mistle <b>thrush</b> (T. viscivorus) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese <b>thrush</b> (T. mupinensis), {{although}} much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 60 species of medium to large <b>thrushes</b> in the genus Turdus, characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A {{mitochondrial}} DNA study identified the mistle <b>thrush's</b> closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and Chinese <b>thrushes,</b> all three species being early offshoots from the main Turdus radiation, and hence more distantly related to other European <b>thrushes</b> such as the common blackbird.|$|R
50|$|With such an {{abundance}} of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle <b>thrushes,</b> tawny owls, song <b>thrushes,</b> great spotted woodpeckers and chaffinches.|$|R
60|$|This made Solomon {{his friend}} for ever, {{and after the}} two had {{consulted}} together they called {{a meeting of the}} <b>thrushes.</b> You will see presently why <b>thrushes</b> only were invited.|$|R
5|$|The song <b>thrush</b> is {{not usually}} gregarious, {{although}} several birds may roost together in winter or be loosely associated in suitable feeding habitats, perhaps with other thrushes such as the blackbird, fieldfare, redwing and dark-throated <b>thrush.</b> Unlike the more nomadic fieldfare and redwing, the song <b>thrush</b> tends to return regularly to the same wintering areas.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle <b>thrush</b> is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the <b>thrush,</b> which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.|$|E
5|$|B.: Throstle is a colloquial Black Country {{name for}} the song <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
50|$|Birdwatchers {{will find}} varied <b>thrushes</b> and hermit <b>thrushes</b> {{in the dense}} timber around the guard station. Nuthatches, chickadees, and Steller's jays are common. There are also pileated {{woodpeckers}} in the surrounding forest, {{but they can be}} hard to spot.|$|R
50|$|Wood <b>thrushes</b> are monogamous. Breeding pairs form in mid-April to early-May, {{and usually}} last {{throughout}} the breeding season. Most <b>thrushes</b> {{find a new}} mate each year, and mate guarding and extra-pair copulations have not been observed in this species.|$|R

5|$|Desiderius Erasmus's early sixteenth-century {{collection}} of Latin proverbs included Turdus malum sibi ipse cacat, (the <b>thrush</b> himself excretes his own trouble), {{which refers to}} the use of the sticky berries favoured by this species to make birdlime for trapping birds. The <b>thrush</b> is literally spreading the seeds of his own destruction.|$|E
5|$|External parasites of the mistle <b>thrush</b> {{include the}} hen flea, the moorhen flea, the {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the <b>thrush</b> may be hosting tapeworms, nematodes, and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species.|$|E
5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle <b>thrush</b> feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the <b>thrush</b> onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle <b>thrush</b> will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>thrushes</b> are a family, Turdidae, of {{passerine}} {{birds with}} a worldwide distribution. The family was once much larger before the subfamily Saxicolinae, {{which includes the}} chats and European robins, was split out {{and moved to the}} Old World flycatchers. The <b>thrushes</b> are small to medium-sized ground living birds that feed on insects, other invertebrates and fruit. A number of unrelated species around the world have been named after <b>thrushes</b> due to their similarity to birds in this family.|$|R
50|$|In Plautus' comedy The Captives, a {{reference}} to the Turdetani (Act i, Scene ii) seems to show that their district in Hispania Baetica had become proverbially famous for the <b>thrushes</b> and small birds supplied for Roman tables. Turdus is the genus of the <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The song <b>thrush</b> (Turdus philomelos) is a <b>thrush</b> that breeds {{across much}} of Eurasia. It has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has three {{recognised}} subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has frequently been referred to in poetry.|$|E
5|$|The song <b>thrush</b> is {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this is very rare because the <b>thrush</b> recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the song <b>thrush</b> does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|The song <b>thrush</b> is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the blackbird, the song <b>thrush</b> finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E
50|$|Further {{conjecture}} {{has occurred}} through other DNA sequencing studies of birds. A recent study {{has found that}} the Psophodidae (whipbirds and quail <b>thrushes)</b> was polyphyletic, with Cinclosomatidae (quail <b>thrushes)</b> and Ptilorrhoa (jewel-babblers) comprising a lineage unrelated to Psophodes (whipbirds and wedgebills). This too has yet to be confirmed.|$|R
60|$|Then all the <b>thrushes</b> hopped for joy, {{and that}} very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat. All their {{ordinary}} business fell into arrears. It was {{the time of the}} year when they should have been pairing, but not a <b>thrush's</b> nest was built except this big one, and so Solomon soon ran short of <b>thrushes</b> with which to supply the demand from the mainland. The stout, rather greedy children, who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk, were all young <b>thrushes</b> once, and ladies often ask specially for them. What do you think Solomon did? He sent over to the house-tops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes' nests, and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all <b>thrushes!</b> It was known afterwards on the island as the Sparrows' Year; and so, when you meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are, very likely they belong to that year. You ask them.|$|R

5|$|The song <b>thrush</b> is {{the emblem}} of West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet <b>thrush</b> in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, The Throstles.|$|E
5|$|Mathews and Cave {{also began}} to muster their forces, already {{commanding}} 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general. 150 sailors and marines were landed from the Pearl-class protected cruiser Philomel and the gunboat <b>Thrush,</b> which were anchored in the harbour. The naval contingent, {{under the command of}} Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of <b>Thrush</b> were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. HMS Sparrow, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to <b>Thrush.</b>|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{opportunities}} in Spanish juniper Juniperus thurifera woodlands: {{the case of}} migratory <b>thrushes</b> Turdus spp. Spanish juniper Juniperus thurifera woodlands are the core habitat of several sites included in the Nature 2000 Network and the wintering ground of many European <b>thrushes</b> Turdus spp. These birds have amajor ecological role as seed dispersers and are increasingly {{taken into account in}} the design of strategies aimed to conserve or restore plant communities. Socio-economic changes in rural Spain have reduced traditional sheep grazing in juniper woodlands, which are now increasingly used for wood production. This has brought the opportunity to improve their carrying capacity for migratory <b>thrushes.</b> Here we explore the spatio-temporal patterning of fleshy cone production and the way birds track this resource. We also investigate whether fleshy cone availability constrains bird numbers. The results show sharp losses of cones during the ripening period, inter-site and inter-winter changes in cone production and the tracking of ripe cones by birds. Mean availability of ripe cones in poorly productive patches was insufficient to maintain <b>thrushes</b> in mid January and highly productive patches offered resources to maintain birds for around 12 days. This suggests an insufficiency of food in the woodlands to permit <b>thrushes</b> to complete the winter and to begin their return northward migration in March. These results are used to suggest some guidelines for improving the carrying capacity of these woodlands for migratory <b>thrushes.</b> ...|$|R
