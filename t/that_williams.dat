5|$|Attorney General George H. Williams {{administered}} the United States Department of Justice with slackness. There were rumors <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> was taking bribes {{in exchange for}} declining to prosecute pending trial cases. In 1875, Williams was supposed to prosecute the merchant house Pratt & Boyd for fraudulent customhouse entries. The Senate Judiciary Committee had found <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation. Williams had also indiscreetly used Justice Department funds to pay for carriage and household expenses.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{began dating}} Australian actor Heath Ledger, her Brokeback Mountain co-star, in 2004 after {{meeting on the}} set of the film. In late April 2005 People {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> and Ledger were expecting a child together. On October 28, 2005, Williams gave birth to their daughter Matilda Rose Ledger.|$|E
5|$|Williams was a vocal {{supporter}} of Dwight D. Eisenhower. According to singer Jo Stafford, he sent Eisenhower a telegram {{on his birthday}} prior to the 1952 presidential election informing him <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> considered it a personal honor to endorse a military figure to lead the nation in its coming future.|$|E
50|$|After {{a summer}} <b>that</b> <b>William</b> is sure {{has changed his}} life forever, Lola leaves town on the train. The book concludes with a Maeterlinck-inspired flash-forward, showing <b>that</b> <b>William</b> has indeed survived the trials of adolescence.|$|R
50|$|Sources {{are divided}} {{regarding}} the Wilsons' ages. Some indicate <b>that</b> <b>William</b> was born ca. 1764, {{and his sister}} two years later, while others suggest that Elizabeth was born ca. 1758 and <b>that</b> <b>William</b> was her younger brother by an unspecified period of time. There is no record of other siblings, and some accounts specify <b>that</b> <b>William</b> was his parents' only son and Elizabeth their only daughter. William {{was said to have}} been born in Lebanon, in present-day Lebanon County, although in every other instance he and his family are linked to Chester County.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, it was {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> had written material with Soul Mekanik, Chambers and Ronson. The singer's spokesman, Tim Clark, {{said that the}} artist was planning to begin recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. The album was mostly written in Williams' home studio and was recorded in London. Amongst those who collaborated in the songwriting were Danny Spencer and Kelvin Andrews, Brandon Christy, Craig Russo, Richard Scott and Scott Ralph, Chas Jankel and Fil Eisler.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{rising to}} fame in 2004 as a finalist {{on the third}} season of American Idol, Leah LaBelle {{released}} covers of songs through her YouTube account, and found minor success. American record producer Pharrell Williams, discovered LaBelle through her videos, and called So So Def Recording's founder and CEO Jermaine Dupri for his opinion of her. In 2011, LaBelle was signed to a joint record deal with L.A. Reid's company Epic Records, Dupri's So So Def Recordings, and Williams' label I Am Other. She said <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> and Dupri were drawn to her style of performing.|$|E
5000|$|The court {{relied on}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>William’s</b> “testimony and demeanor” led the court to believe <b>that</b> <b>William</b> was {{not the type of}} person that {{deliberately}} would place the ring in the garbage disposal. Therefore, the court concluded <b>that</b> <b>William</b> placed the original ring in the garbage disposal accidentally. Accordingly, the court stated that the damage to the ring resulted from the “destructive force of the disposal coupled with the accident or mischance of placing it therein; that because this is so, the damage must be said to have arisen from fortuitous events over which petitioners had no control.” ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{misrepresentation}} is <b>that</b> <b>William</b> White {{once lived}} in Holland. For many years genealogists assumed <b>that</b> <b>William</b> White spent his early married years in Holland, marrying and burying children but no proof that they apply to the Pilgrim William White but rather they probably apply to the William White who was still living there in 1621.|$|R
50|$|On June 27, 2017, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) wrote {{a letter}} to Governor McAuliffe asking him to stop the {{execution}} of a clearly mentally ill man. NAMI highlighted the fact <b>that</b> <b>William</b> suffered from a long-standing mental illness that was initially misdiagnosed and that the jury did not hear <b>that</b> <b>William's</b> delusions led to his crimes.|$|R
5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to bury the gun {{on the beach and}} send a letter to Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|The band {{unanimously}} {{decided to}} carry on and arrange auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked Lamar Williams, {{an old friend of}} drummer Jai Johanny Johanson's from Gulfport, Mississippi. The band immediately recognized <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> represented the best of both Oakley's style and his own style, and they were pleased with his easygoing demeanor. The addition of Leavell and Williams to the band brought about renewed passion and uplifted spirits within the group.|$|E
5|$|Williams played {{high school}} {{football}} at Seneca High School MCA for the Red Hawks, where he started at the defensive tackle position as a freshman before switching to offensive tackle. The Red Hawks competed in the playoffs each year <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> played. In his senior year, he was named a 2003 first-team all-state player by the Associated Press and the Courier-Journal after leading his team to a 10–2 record and {{the second round of}} state playoffs. The Red Hawks were also ranked first in the state {{for the first time in}} school history that season. Williams also played track and field at Seneca, and he was ranked second in the state at shot put in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Williams was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Municipal Auditorium in Charleston, West Virginia on Wednesday December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled US$3,500. That day, because of an ice storm in the Nashville area, Williams could not fly, so he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts. Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> would not arrive on time owing to the ice storm and was ordered to drive Williams to Canton, Ohio, for the New Year's Day concert there.|$|E
5|$|A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 {{showed that}} 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams' Progressive Conservatives. His {{popularity}} {{had been in}} the seventies according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009. Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, the first of which was by Global News and Ipsos and the second was by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams' performance, the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall with 58 percent.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the will}} of his son, Sir Richard Fowler (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Chancellor of the Exchequer for Edward IV, it is stated <b>that</b> <b>William</b> had been interred in St. Dunstan's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Richard {{acquired}} this manor in 1467, so we may presume <b>that</b> <b>William</b> (and possibly Cecily) had died in or before that year.|$|R
5|$|Musker and Clements {{created the}} Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during {{breaks in the}} shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first house}} burned, {{and the family}} lost its possessions. They {{moved to a new}} house {{on the other side of}} town on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a small garden, on which they grew diverse crops <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama. Williams told Hill that his mother was interested to talk with him about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo Williams' disability pension. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E
5|$|Raised to {{temporary}} air commodore, Goble {{took over}} as CAS {{for the second time}} between December 1932 and June 1934, while Williams attended the Imperial Defence College in London. On secondment to the RAF from 1935 to 1937, Goble was attached to the British Air Ministry as Deputy Director of Air Operations. In this capacity he attended a conference in 1936 to examine a Commonwealth-wide air training plan, a concept that would be revived in World War II as the Empire Air Training Scheme. Continuing his exchange posting, on 1 September Goble {{took over as}} Air Officer Commanding No. 2 (Bomber) Group, based in Hampshire. The group comprised fifteen squadrons, putting him in charge of a force stronger than the entire RAAF. On 28 February 1937, Goble was raised to temporary air vice marshal. He succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time in February 1939, when the latter was dismissed from his position {{in the aftermath of the}} Ellington Report criticising the standards of training and air safety observed by the RAAF. When he replaced Williams, Goble was Air Member for Personnel and might therefore have been considered more closely responsible for such standards; he maintained <b>that</b> <b>Williams</b> had personally overseen the service's air training since 1934.|$|E
