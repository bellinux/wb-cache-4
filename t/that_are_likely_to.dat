5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} {{significantly greater}} than one have been observed, {{so there are no}} confirmed observations of comets <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} constellation is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3.5, followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4.1. Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be the result of}} two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, is a hot blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be using {{it at the same}} time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E
