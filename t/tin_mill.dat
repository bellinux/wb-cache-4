[...] It {{provides a}} drier alternative to the adjacent set of stepping stones when the river level is high. [...] The bridge has an above-deck truss design and is constructed largely of tubular steel. [...] It was manufactured by Tubewrights Ltd of Newport (Gwent). [...] This was a company that specialised in the fabrication of tubular steel structures. [...] It had other factories in London, Liverpool and Glasgow and was in business from 1899 until 1981.

[...] The western {{terminus}} {{of the highway}} was a trumpet interchange with <b>Tin</b> <b>Mill</b> Road (now Riverside Drive) where the mainline continued northwest as Dundalk Avenue across the drawbridge. [...] Bethlehem Boulevard had a cloverleaf interchange with the Peninsula Expressway that featured a wide split in the median. [...] East of the Peninsula Expressway interchange was a partial interchange with Wharf Road that offered access from Wharf Road {{to and from the}} west. [...] The fourth junction was a partial interchange with MD 151 that allowed access between Bethlehem Boulevard to the west and MD 151 to the north. [...] Eastbound Bethlehem Boulevard continued east to MD 20 (North Point Road). [...] When MD 695 (now I-695) was completed as a two-lane freeway on a viaduct parallel to Bethlehem Boulevard from Edgemere to the Key Bridge in 1977, the only changes to the interchanges were two pairs of ramps from the west at the Peninsula Expressway interchange and from the east at the MD 151 interchange.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mention of}} {{settlement}} in Ivybridge was the manor of Stowford in the Domesday Book of 1086. Although the first mention of Ivybridge came in 1280 {{when it was}} described as [...] "dowry of land {{on the west side}} of the River Erme, by the Ivy Bridge." [...] There was a chapel, that was on the site of Saint John's Church, since 1402. From the 16th century onwards mills were built in the town, harnessing the power of the river. Records show that in the 16th century there was a corn mill, a <b>tin</b> <b>mill</b> and an edge mill. One of the mills, 'Glanville's Mill' (a corn mill), was situated where many of the town's shops are today and gives its name to the shopping centre. The first church (Saint John's) was built in 1790 as a chapel of ease, but 45 years later in 1835 it was consecrated as a district church. In the 1830s the Ivy Bridge lost its position as the only means of crossing the river when the 'New Bridge' was built joining Fore Street and Exeter Road.|$|E

The tramroad crossed the River Taff over the Iron Bridge. The feeder’s lock was permanently closed in 1871 when it was bridged over, but traces of it still remain.|$|R
2500|$|Ivybridge's {{earliest}} known economy {{relied on}} the River Erme with a corn mill, <b>tin</b> <b>mill</b> and an edge mill in existence in the town. Later development of the town relied on both the River Erme and the railway, which {{was built in the}} latter part of the Industrial Revolution of the United Kingdom. The largest employer to the town from 1787 Stowford Paper Mill, which led to population growth in the town. The paper mill closed in 2013. With the expansion of the town in the late 20th century much of the new jobs are in the service sector of industry. Due to the A38 Ivybridge's transport to nearby city Plymouth was made possible as a commuter route. As a result, a lot of Ivybridge's work or [...] "economy" [...] is made in Plymouth and nearby towns. Ivybridge does still have some of its own industry with a small industrial estate at the south of the town and very nearby an industrial estate just to the west at Lee Mill. There have been attempts to brand the town as a walking centre for southern Dartmoor. There is good access to Dartmoor from the town. For example, one route follows the route of the old china clay railway to Redlake in the heart of the moor, another glides delightfully by the Erme through Longtimber Woods. There are other accesses to the Moor. The Two Moors Way, which crosses Dartmoor and Exmoor starts in Ivybridge and finishes in Lynmouth on the North Devon coast.|$|E

40|$|Artefacts {{relating}} to tin smelting from <b>tin</b> <b>mills</b> or ¿blowing houses¿ in Devon and Cornwall, plus material from smelting sites that cover {{a range of}} dates from the Bronze Age through to the 19 th Century, were examined: these include metallic tin, furnace linings, ore samples and slag. Analysis of tin slags from over forty sites was carried out, to determine microstructure and chemical composition. Techniques employed included optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence and ICP mass spectrometry. Analysis indicates that slag appearance and composition are heavily influenced by local geology. Composition, particularly iron content, is shown {{to have a strong}} effect on slag melting point and viscosity, and the implications for the purity of metal produced are discussed.

40|$|Before 1890, Wales was the world's leading {{producer}} of tinplate, and the United States was its primary customer. With {{passage of the}} McKinley tariff on tinplate that year, however, the industry entered a vigorous expansion in the US but went into a steep decline in Wales. Underemployed tinplate workers in Wales migrated to the US, where their skills were now in high demand, {{and in the process}} created extensive occupational networks and a transnational niche community. Grounded in the nineteenth-century ideological ideals of female domesticity, the male breadwinner, and the family wage, Welsh tinplate men hoped to achieve these middle-class gender aspirations by completely removing women from the mills in America. That goal was challenged in 1895 when the Monongahela Tin Plate Works in Pittsburgh employed Hattie Williams, an immigrant woman with experience in the Welsh <b>tin</b> <b>mills,</b> to train American women for the work. Almost instantaneously a storm of protest arose from Welsh tinplate workers {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. An analysis of the polemical discourse generated by this episode sheds light on the gendered migration experience of a small, highly skilled transatlantic niche community, and the lines of internal fragmentation which undermined its continuity...|$|R
25|$|Polish {{immigrants}} were highly desired by American employers for low-level positions. In steel <b>mills</b> and <b>tin</b> <b>mills,</b> {{it was observed}} that foremen, even when given the choice to directly employ workers of their own ethnic background, still desired to choose Poles. Steel work was undesirable to other immigrant groups, as it lasted 12 hours a day and 7 days a week, self-selecting for the most industrious and hardworking people. Polish immigrants chose to chain-market the job positions to their friends and relatives, and it was very common for a Polish friend with good English to negotiate wage rates for newer immigrants. Polish Americans favored steel areas and mining camps, which had a high demand for manual labor; favorite destinations included Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Buffalo, New York, and Pittsburgh, as well as smaller industrial cities and mining towns. Relatively few went to New England or to farming areas; almost none went to the South. Poles came to dominate certain fields of work: in 1920, 33.1% of all U.S. coal-mine operatives and 25.2% of all blast furnace laborers were Polish. Polish {{immigrants were}} categorized for low-status positions within U.S. companies, as the same steel companies that recruited Polish immigrants for work in blast furnaces recruited Irish immigrants for work with finished metal.|$|R

The XRD patterns of the annealed powders prove that the powders are single phase of <b>TiN.</b> In the <b>milling</b> progress, titanium reacts with the decomposed products of urea, ammonia gas (NH 3) and cyanic acid (HNCO) to form <b>TiN.</b> With the <b>milling</b> time increasing, the activity and the defect energy of titanium increase, so the diffusion activation energy for nitrogen diffusing in titanium decreases. The diffusion distance also decreases because the new TiN layer between Ti and nitrogen can be brought by milling. With the content of TiN increasing, the nucleus of TiN are formed which grow to nano-crystalline. </FONT...|$|R
