25|$|When {{he was in}} his 60s, Eliot {{wrote that}} he was {{immature}} and timid at the time, and was probably in love with Emily Hale, a Bostonian he had had a relationship with in the United States. What he wanted from Haigh-Wood, he said, was a flirtation. But a meeting with the American poet Ezra Pound had persuaded him that the pursuit of poetry was possible, and marrying Haigh-Wood meant he could stay in England and avoid Harvard.

25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> that same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E

His personal life was also taxed.

500|$|The Pounds {{were unhappy}} in Paris; Dorothy {{complained about the}} winters and Ezra's health was poor. A dinner a guest {{randomly}} tried to stab him; to Pound [...] this underlined that their time in France was over.

How Johnson managed this feat is unclear; he later cryptically <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> that [...] "his friends came about him, and set him up again". An early 19th-century biography states that [...] "Mr. Johnson was now so well known, and had been so highly respected, that on this unfortunate occasion, his friends with one accord met, and contributed to enable him to begin business again". Chard speculates that Priestley assisted him since they were such close friends.|$|E
500|$|Albert's {{body was}} {{temporarily}} entombed in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, {{until a year}} after his death his remains were deposited at Frogmore Mausoleum, which remained incomplete until 1871. The sarcophagus, in which both he and the Queen were eventually laid, was carved from the largest block of granite that had ever been quarried in Britain.

Maybe he doesn't believe in anything," [...] an assessment shared by others {{both inside and outside the}} administration.|$|E
