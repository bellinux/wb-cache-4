25|$|There {{were a lot}} of very {{important}} ideas <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the mainstream media couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing barrettes in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach.|$|E
25|$|On February 5, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds {{stated the}} {{following}} in an interview: We support {{the freedom of}} speech, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is very clear.

25|$|I {{like them}} all. There's {{bits and pieces}} of books <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are good. I never rework a book. I'd rather use what I've learned on the next one, and make it a little bit better. The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.|$|E
25|$|Neal {{started to}} write {{some of his}} {{ensembles}} {{with some of the}} figures that come from that early bebop thing.

25|$|But {{the reality}} is, I respect, you know, {{the opinion of}} Catholic — (off mike) — {{religious}} leaders of all kinds.

He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "To win over public opinion, Labour must reflect it. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> right? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> right. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> why they're all doing this synchronised frowning at poor repellent-ebullient Jeremy Corbyn and pretending he's a weirdo." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{was reading}} the Bible around that time. <b>That's</b> where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> phrases such as [...] "workman's wages" [...] came from, and [...] "seeking out the poorer quarters". <b>That</b> was biblical. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the song was about me: everybody's beating me up, and I'm telling you now I'm {{going to go away}} if you don't stop.|$|R
25|$|I {{know there}} are some who {{disagree}} and I respect their point of view but I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception I have to have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother. I just struggled with it myself for a long time but I came to realize: Life is that gift from God <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head.

500|$|... "It's {{very close}} to home [...] I OK'd it with my family and {{everything}} because they think it's important, because we're obviously very different now than we were when we were younger.

500|$|However, Tolkien was not fond of all {{the artistic}} {{representation}} of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of The Hobbit as [...] "too Disnified ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of".|$|E
