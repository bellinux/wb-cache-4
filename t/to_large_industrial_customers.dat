2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the supply of {{electricity}} consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand. If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management (DSM). [...] For decades, utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates, to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours, {{in the same way that}} telephone companies do with individual customers. [...] Usually, these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time. [...] In an attempt to save more money, some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute spot prices, which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen, and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money. Demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited <b>to</b> <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers.</b> In residential and small business applications, for example, appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters, air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw. Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours. A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment. For example, many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation, weatherstripping, and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient, as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating. Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products, but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment, like boilers, or use more efficient processes to produce products. Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment. Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS).|$|E

50|$|Ontario's {{electricity}} grid {{is made up}} of a 29 000 km high-voltage transmission network that delivers electricity <b>to</b> <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers</b> and municipal utilities and 123 000 km low-voltage distribution system that serves about 1.3 million end use customers mainly in rural service areas and smaller municipal communities in the province. More than 75 percent of the applications to connect small generators are in Hydro One's rural service territory along the company's distribution system. While Hydro One has connected thousands of small projects to the grid it is approaching their technical limits of the wires and equipment in some rural locations. In these areas there are two issues that limit the number of projects that Hydro One can safely connect without putting the grid in jeopardy. The first issue is the physical limits of the power lines and the second is a phenomenon called 'islanding'. In larger areas that are densely populated, Hydro One's wires are thicker and designed to deliver larger amounts of electricity. In rural areas, Hydro One's distribution wires are smaller, thinner and deliver a smaller amount of electricity because they were designed to serve a much smaller number of customers than in large urban centers. These thinner lines deliver electricity safely and reliably to rural customers and are able to support the connection of small generation projects spread across the line, but these lines become over loaded when more electricity is fed back to the grid than the line was built to deliver. In some areas where the program is extremely popular, many generators want to connect to the same thin line but the line is not able to support the transfer of so much electricity.|$|E
30|$|Demand {{response}} (DR) {{was introduced}} more than 30  years ago for shifting or reducing peak electricity demand (Strbac, 2008). Power {{systems have been}} built to meet peak demand – the maximum demand dictates the size of generators and ratings of transmission lines and transformers even if peaks last {{just a few hours}} per year. Billions have been spent on extra capacity and infrastructure to cater for these few hours. On the other hand, power utilities could avoid costly investments by shifting or reducing peak demand. Thus, it made perfect sense to offer lower “interruptible” or “curtailable” rates <b>to</b> <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> and commercial <b>customers</b> for the right to temporarily reduce their electricity consumption.|$|R
40|$|New {{reliability}} importance {{measures have}} been developed for the power industry to be applied for Electricity Transmission Systems (ETS). Reliability criticality measures are useful metrics to rank components regarding their impact on system performance. Criticality measures serve as useful tools to priority reliability improvement activities, identify weak-links in the system and many other uses. These proposed measures pertain to the outage rate of the system and component instead of the probability of failure or survival for a defined mission time. Outage rate is the best suited and appropriate output variable to evaluate the importance of the components in the electricity distribution system. The ETS is the component of the bulk transmission system to provide electricity <b>to</b> <b>large</b> municipalities, <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers</b> and the retail distribution system. The ETS is composed mainly of components such as lines, transformers, breakers and buses. All these components are interconnected with the aim of transporting electrical energy from the bulk transmission system to various load points.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the feasibility of}} replacing regulation or state ownership with market competition in electric power generation. Interest in competitive electricity markets has been stimulated by recent experiences in the United Kingdom and Brazil with privatiza-tion, with deregulation in the United States, and with partial reform in Norway. Whilethe Thatcher government policy offers lessons {{about the process of}} privatizing a state monopolyenterprise, the American experiencebecomes relevant to ourunderstanding of howincreasingly competitive markets for electricity actually work. The continuing growth of competition in American electricity markets is an unantici-patedconsequence of the 1978 passage ofthe Public Utility Regulatory Polices Act. Designed as aconservation measure, PURPA established the right of cogenerators and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to sell electricity to local regulated Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs). Such rights were broadened substantially by the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 which requires transmission line owners to wheel bulk power (Walters and Smith 1993). Thus, under current federal regulations nonutility power producers can sell electricity to any utility on the grid. Furthermore, in April 1994, the California Public Utility Commission adopted a policy establishing complete open access to all power producers. By 1996 independent generators can compete to sell electricity directly <b>to</b> <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers,</b> effectively bypassing traditional utilities.

40|$|In 2007, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) {{formed the}} Customer Response Task Force (CRTF) to {{identify}} barriers to deploying demand response (DR) resources in wholesale markets and develop policies {{to overcome these}} barriers. One of the initiatives of this Task Force was to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs, program rules, and utility operating practices. This report describes {{the results of a}} comprehensive survey conducted by LBNL in support of the Customer Response Task Force and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs into wholesale markets in the SPP region. LBNL conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs administered by SPP's member utilities. Survey respondents were asked to provide information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet planning reserves requirements, DR resource availability (e. g. seasonal, annual), participant incentive structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. Nearly all of the 30 load-serving entities in SPP responded to the survey. Of this group, fourteen SPP member utilities administer 36 DR programs, five dynamic pricing tariffs, and six voluntary customer response initiatives. These existing DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs have a peak demand reduction potential of 1, 552 MW. Other major findings of this study are: o About 81 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered <b>to</b> <b>large</b> commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>customers,</b> while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 14 percent. o Arkansas accounts for ~;; 50 percent of the DR resources in the SPP footprint; these DR resources are primarily managed by cooperatives. o Publicly-owned cooperatives accounted for 54 percent of the existing DR resources among SPP members. For these entities, investment in DR is often driven by the need to reduce summer peak demand that is used to set demand charges for each distribution cooperative. o About 65 - 70 percent of the interruptible/curtailable tariffs and DLC programs are routinely triggered based on market conditions, not just for system emergencies. Approximately, 53 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and 447 MW can be dispatched with less than thirty minutes notice. o Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels ranged from $ 0. 40 to $ 8. 30 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 0. 30 to $ 4. 60 /kW-month for DLC programs.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the winter}} season (November 1 st to February 28 th), National Grid {{identifies}} the three half-hour periods of highest consumption of electricity, subject to a separation of at least 10 calendar days. These three periods are called Triads. Thus, the half-hour in which national demand was highest is the first Triad; the second highest half-hour, excluding a period of 21 days centred on the first Triad, is the second Triad; and the third highest half-hour, excluding two periods of 21 days centred on the first and second Triads, is the third Triad. Historically, Triads always occur on Mondays to Thursdays between 16 : 30 and 18 : 00 hours, and not close to Christmas (which is a period of relatively low consumption). Figure 1 shows the typical pattern over a winter. Figure 1 : National electricity consumption figures from the winter of 2003 / 04. Diamonds indicate daily levels; squares indicate dates on which British Energy issued Triad warnings; and circles indicate those dates on which a Triad was, at {{the end of the}} winter, declared to have occurred. British Energy supplies electricity <b>to</b> <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> and commercial <b>customers.</b> Charges are based on the Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS) Charges which are levied by National Grid and passed through to British Energy’s customers. TNUoS includes a substantial surcharge based on each customer’s usage during the Triad periods: the higher a customer’s usage during Triads, the higher their overall electricity supply costs. British Energy, in common with other large commercial electricity suppliers, aims to reduce National Grid charges for some of its customers by issuing a “Triad warning” on days when it seems possible that a Triad might later be found to have occurred. <b>Industrial</b> <b>customers</b> are often encouraged by their contract with British Energy to reduce their consumption on those warning days. British Energy are restricted by the contract to issuing a limited number of calls over the entire winter period, anything up to 23. A customer who receives a Triad warning may, or may not, take action (e. g. shutting down their factory early that day). Some – but not all – customers are contractually required to inform British Energy whether or not they are reducing their consumption. Therefore British Energy cannot be sure by how much overall consumption will drop if a warning is issued. Furthermore, the national consumption is also affected by suppliers other than British Energy who may also have issued a Triad warning. It is thought that this system may suffer from “negative feedback”. That is, on a day that is likely to include a Triad period because it has high predicted consumption, many suppliers will issue warnings, resulting in many customers reducing their actual consumption, ensuring that the total national demand is actually much lower than predicted: sufficiently low, in fact, that no Triad occurs, and no warning was actually necessary. It is expensive for customers to take action when it is not actually required. British Energy currently uses the deterministic half-hourly consumption forecast issued by National Grid and the recent and forecast temperatures at hourly intervals at 7 locations around the country to decide on a daily basis whether to issue a Triad warning. The decision-making tool, called TriFoS, does not currently take into account the possible problem of negative feedback. The Study Group was asked to consider ways of compensating for negative feedback. Section 2 confirms that feedback is a statistically significant phenomenon. Sections 3 and 4 then use the so-called ‘Full-Information Secretary Problem’ to motivate the derivation of possible triad-calling strategies. Section 5 examines the possibilities for issuing triad warnings from analysing historical data...|$|R

40|$|The Organization of Midwest ISO States (OMS) {{launched}} the Midwest Demand Resource Initiative (MWDRI) in 2007 to identify barriers to deploying demand response (DR) {{resources in the}} Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) region and develop policies to overcome them. The MWDRI stakeholders decided that a useful initial activity would be to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs, program rules, and utility operating practices. This additional detail could then be used to assess any "seams issues" affecting coordination and integration of retail DR resources with MISO's wholesale markets. Working with state regulatory agencies, we conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs, dynamic pricing tariffs, and their features in MISO states. Utilities {{were asked to provide}} information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet planning reserves requirements, DR resource availability (e. g., seasonal, annual), participant incentive structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. This report describes the results of this comprehensive survey and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs into organized wholesale markets. Survey responses from 37 MISO members and 4 non-members provided information on 141 DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs with a peak load reduction potential of 4, 727 MW of retail DR resource. Major findings of this study area: - About 72 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered <b>to</b> <b>large</b> commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>customers,</b> while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 18 percent. Almost 90 percent of the DR resources included in this survey are provided by investor-owned utilities. - Approximately, 90 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and over 1, 900 MW can be dispatched on less than thirty minutes notice. These legacy DR programs are increasingly used by utilities for economic in addition to reliability purposes, with over two-thirds (68 percent) of these programs callable based on market conditions. - Approximately 60 percent of DLC programs and 30 percent of interruptible rate programs called ten or more DR events in 2006. Despite the high frequency of DR events, customer complaints remained low. The use of economic criteria to trigger DR events and the flexibility <b>to</b> trigger a <b>large</b> number of events suggests that DR resources can help improve the efficiency of MISO wholesale markets. - Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels averaged about $ 5 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 6 /kW-month for DLC programs. Few programs offered incentive payments that were explicitly linked to actual load reductions during events and at least 27 DR programs do not have penalties for non-performance. - Measurement and verification (M&V) protocols to estimate load impacts vary significantly across MISO states. Almost half of the DR programs have not been evaluated in recent times and thus performance data for DR events is not available. For many DLC programs, M&V protocols may need to be enhanced in order to allow participation in MISO's proposed EDR schedule. System operators and planners will need to develop more accurate estimates of the load reduced capability and actual performance...|$|R
