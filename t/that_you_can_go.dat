500|$|Mike Scully, who was showrunner {{during seasons}} nine through twelve, {{has been the}} subject of criticism. Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote that [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a {{tranquilizer}} dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years." [...] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked: [...] "Lower your quality standards. Once you've done <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> on forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a k≈çan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can have a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{embarked}} on her worldwide Gypsy Heart Tour (2011) in April, which notably featured no North American dates. Cyrus cited her various controversial moments {{as the reason}} behind this, claiming she only wanted to travel where she felt [...] "the most love". Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records. With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career. She commented, [...] "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm sure I do... I'm probably going to go book an acting coach." [...] She later confirmed {{she would not be}} going to college for the time being, stating that [...] " [...] a firm believer <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> back at any age you want", and that she [...] " [...] worked hard to get to where [...] now, and [...] to enjoy it while it lasts".|$|E

500|$|Despite this, much of Scully's work on {{the show}} also {{received}} critical praise. Scully won five Primetime Emmy Awards {{for his work on}} The Simpsons, while Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" [...] as the show's 22nd best episode. Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review, something he also did for [...] "Behind the Laughter" [...] and [...] "Trilogy of Error", which aired during season 12. He called the latter: [...] "one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them." [...] Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully, and that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book that blaming a single show runner for what some perceive as the lowering quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, [...] "Lower your quality standards. Once you've done <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> on forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The IWF {{said they}} were first {{notified}} of the Wikipedia URL on 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, [...] "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia". EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared [...] "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors [...] "favour inclusion {{in all but the}} most extreme cases". However, according to The Guardian because [...] "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that [...] "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly [...] "given <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> into HMV and buy a copy on the high street". [...] On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages {{on the basis of the}} [...] "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".|$|E

6000|$|I rejoice {{to observe}} that the {{encouragement}} of research occupies so prominent a place in your official documents, and in the wise and liberal inaugural address of your president. This subject of the encouragement, or, as it is sometimes called, the endowment of research, has of late years greatly exercised the minds of men in England. It {{was one of the}} main topics of discussion by the members of the Royal Commission of whom I was one, and who not long since issued their report, after five years' labour. Many seem to think that this question is mainly one of money; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> into the market and buy research, and that supply will follow demand, as in the ordinary course of commerce. This view does not commend itself to my mind. I know of no more difficult practical problem than the discovery of a method of encouraging and supporting the original investigator without opening the door to nepotism and jobbery. My own conviction is admirably summed up in the passage of your president's address, [...] "that the best investigators are usually those who have also the responsibilities of instruction, gaining thus the incitement of colleagues, the encouragement of pupils, and the observation of the public." ...|$|E
