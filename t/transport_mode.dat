50|$|Users of {{transport}} systems often use several <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> {{to complete a}} journey. They will change <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> at a <b>transport</b> hub, and all <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> have some kind {{of transport}} hub.|$|R
40|$|Long run {{developments}} such {{as income}} growth and urban sprawl {{lead one to}} expect a continuous decline of thecontribution of non-motorised <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> {{to the performance of}} transport systems. In terms {{of the total number of}} trips, non-motorised <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> have retained high shares, however. The potential of non-motorised <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> to contribute to the urban quality of life is increasingly being recognised. In this paper the possibilities of substitution between non-motorised and motorised transport are discussed. In addition, attention is paid to the issue of complementarity between motorised and non-motorised <b>transport</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
30|$|As such, {{there is}} {{substantially}} no national-level planning scheme dealing with or aiming to integrate different <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> in Japan as of yet. Strong independence among {{each of the}} <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> is still observed, while few plans make efforts to coordinate these different <b>transport</b> <b>modes.</b> This situation in turn brings about a lack of a strategy for the national transport system. Policymaking for intermodal and multimodal transport is also substantially lacking.|$|R
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} (PRT), also {{referred}} to as podcars, is a public <b>transport</b> <b>mode</b> featuring small automated vehicles operating on a network of specially built guideways. PRT is a type of automated guideway transit (AGT), a class of system which also includes larger vehicles all the way to small subway systems.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{privatisation}} and successive governments persisting with auto-centric {{urban development}} into the 21st century, there {{have since been}} large increases in public transport patronage, with the mode share for commuters increasing to 14.8% and 8.4% of all trips. A target of 20% public <b>transport</b> <b>mode</b> share for Melbourne by 2020 was set by the state government in 2006. Since 2006 public transport patronage has grown by over 20%.|$|E
25|$|Aviation {{has become}} an {{important}} passenger <b>transport</b> <b>mode</b> since the 1960s. Aircraft is the commonly used mode of transport on longer distances, and the routes between Oslo and Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger are all among the largest in Europe. On long distances, such as Oslo-Bodø and longer, air travel {{is by far the}} leading travel method. In Western and Northern Norway, with difficult terrain, obstacling fjords and lack of rail transport, regional airline travel provides quick travel within the region or to the capital.|$|E
30|$|An {{analysis}} on energy impact of different <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> must necessarily consider {{the intensity of}} different <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> on a global scale. They have been obtained by [26] and [27] and reported in Table  4.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{intensity}} of travel being more in urban areas, {{it is better}} that the energy-saving measures are focused on urban transportation. The energy requirement of motorized private <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> is much more compared to the energy requirement by public <b>transport</b> <b>modes.</b> Urban land-use pattern is also a factor influencing the {{intensity of}} travel in a city. Hence, orientation of the urban transportation planning process to facilitate use of public <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> and non-motorized <b>modes</b> of <b>transport</b> with simultaneous restructuring of the urban land-use pattern will help energy saving. *Author for correspondenc...|$|R
40|$|Car use is an {{increasingly}} {{serious problem in}} many modern cities because of polluting emissions, noise, accidents and congestion. To examine this issue, this paper analyzes the individual choice between taking the car and using alternative <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> (e. g. walking, cycling, taking the bus etc [...] .) {{in the presence of}} cars' negative impacts on alternative <b>transport</b> <b>modes.</b> Using a simple evolutionary model, we show the existence of suboptimal Nash equilibria characterized by the widespread use of cars and discuss the effects of simple transport policies that reduce cars' negative impacts on alternative <b>transport</b> <b>modes.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Transport in New Zealand, {{with its}} mountainous {{topography}} and {{a relatively small}} population mostly located near its long coastline, has always faced many challenges. Before Europeans arrived, Māori either walked or used watercraft on rivers or along the coasts. Later on, European shipping and railways revolutionised the way of transporting goods and people, before being themselves overtaken by road and air, which are nowadays the dominant forms of transport. However, bulk freight still continues to be transported by coastal shipping and by rail transport, and there are attempts to (re)introduce public transport as a major <b>transport</b> <b>mode</b> in the larger population centres.|$|E
25|$|In {{developed}} countries with high utility cycling levels, utility cyclists tend to undertake relatively short journeys. According to Irish 1996 Census data, over 55% of cycling workers travelled 3miles (4.8km) or less, 27% 5miles (8km) or less and only 17% travelled more than 5miles {{in their daily}} commute. It {{can be argued that}} factors that directly influence trip length or journey time are among the most important in making cycling a competitive <b>transport</b> <b>mode.</b> Car ownership rates can also be influential. In New York City, {{more than half of all}} households do not own a car (the figure is even higher in Manhattan, over 75%), and walk/bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city.|$|E

40|$|Different {{transportation}} modes have key operational advantages and disadvantages, providing {{a variety of}} different transport options to users and passengers. This paper reviews key variables for the competition between air transport and other <b>transport</b> <b>modes.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the competition between air transport and other <b>transport</b> <b>modes,</b> providing results in terms of perceived cost for the users, for destinations high competitiveness for all <b>transport</b> <b>modes.</b> The competitor analysis variables include the cost and time outputs for each transport option, highlighting the level of competitiveness on high demanded Origin-Destination corridors. The case study presents the output of a such analysis for the OD corridor in Greece that connects the Capital city (Athens) with the second largest city (Thessaloniki) and the different <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> have been considered (air, train, road). Conventional wisdom is to present an easy to handle tool for planners, managers and decision makers towards pricing policy effectiveness and demand attractiveness, appropriate to use for other similar cases...|$|R

40|$|Detecting <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> in near-real time is {{important}} for various context-aware location based services and understanding urban dynamics. In this paper we present a simulated study on detecting <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> in near-real time using a neural network. We have shown how detection accuracy will vary with different temporal window sizes and different combination of modes. Since in urban environment <b>transport</b> <b>modes</b> move slowly due to traffic, considering movement attributes or kinematics alone for mode detection is not sufficient. That is why we investigated how spatial information can improve mode detection accuracy. The model has achieved 82 %- 95 % accuracy using different simulation designs and proves its efficacy over other detection models...|$|R
