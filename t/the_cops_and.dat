40|$|We prove new {{theoretical}} results about several {{variations of}} <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> robber game on graphs. First, we consider {{a variation of}} <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> robber game which is more symmetric called <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> killer game. We prove for all $c < 1 $ that almost all random graphs are stalemate for <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> killer game, where each edge occurs with probability $p$ such that $\frac{ 1 }{n^{c}} \le p \le 1 -\frac{ 1 }{n^{c}}$. We prove that a graph can be killer-win {{if and only if}} it has exactly $k\ge 3 $ triangles or none at all. We prove that graphs with multiple cycles longer than triangles permit cop-win and killer-win graphs. For $\left(m,n\right) \neq\left(1, 5 \right) $ and $n\geq 4 $, we show that there are cop-win and killer-win graphs with $m$ $C_n$s. In addition, we identify game outcomes on specific graph products. Next, we find a generalized version of Dijkstra's algorithm that can be applied to find the minimal expected capture time and the minimal evasion probability for <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> gambler game and other variations of graph pursuit. Finally, we consider a randomized version of the killer that is similar to the gambler. We use the generalization of Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal strategies for pursuing the random killer. We prove that if $G$ is a connected graph with maximum degree $d$, then <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> can win with probability at least $\frac{\sqrt d}{ 1 +\sqrt d}$ after learning the killer's distribution. In addition, we prove that this bound is tight only on the $\left(d+ 1 \right) $-vertex star, where the killer takes the center with probability $\frac 1 { 1 +\sqrt d}$ and each of the other vertices with equal probabilities.

40|$|In <b>the</b> {{classical}} <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> robber game, two players, <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> C <b>and</b> <b>the</b> robber R, move alternatively along {{edges of}} a finite graph G=(V,E). <b>The</b> <b>cop</b> captures <b>the</b> robber if both players {{are on the}} same vertex at the same moment of time.

Nowakowski, Winkler (1983) and Quilliot (1983) characterized the cop-win graphs as graphs admitting a dismantling scheme.

2500|$|Hot Pursuit {{goes back}} to the Need for Speed series' roots and takes on the {{gameplay}} style of earlier [...] and [...] titles in the Need for Speed franchise with exotic cars and high-speed police chases. Hot Pursuit lets players be either a racer or a police driver, and features a full career mode for both roles. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> <b>and</b> racers is described as [...] "a dog chasing down a rabbit"; the police being more powerful while the racers are faster. Each side has several power-ups including calling for roadblocks and radar jamming. According to Criterion the single-player section is somewhere between 12 and 15 hours long, but with lots of replay value.|$|E

She depicts, [...] "being taken away to meet God and Jesus and the angels and whatever is beyond the beyond". In her final interview, she once again charged that her mind was [...] "tortured" [...] at BCI, and her head crushed by [...] "sonic pressure". Food poisonings and other abuses worsened, she said, each time she complained, with the goal of making her appear insane, or to drive her insane. She also turned on her interviewer: [...] "You sabotaged my ass! Society, and <b>the</b> <b>cops,</b> <b>and</b> the system! A raped woman got executed, and was used for books and movies and shit!" [...] Her final on-camera words were [...] "Thanks a lot, society, for railroading my ass."

2500|$|Irons {{witnesses}} a {{bank robbery}} organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape {{before he can}} interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals. With the help of Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree), they forge a suit of armor and the weaponry necessary for Irons {{to carry out his}} war on crime and become the vigilante [...] "Steel". However, during his crusade against crime, Irons is pursued by <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> <b>and</b> is forced to return to his lair. The next night, the robbers arrange to rob another bank.

Energy and exergy analysis of single and double effect systems is presented. The effect of different component temperature on <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> exergetic efficiency is calculated. The results showed that <b>the</b> maximum <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> exergetic efficiency is achieved at lower values of the generator & the absorber temperature for both systems.
