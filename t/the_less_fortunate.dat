25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>fortunate,</b> and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower.

25|$|Monastery of Qozhaya, also transliterated Qazahya {{is located}} in the Zgharta District in the North Governorate of Lebanon. It belongs to the Lebanese Maronite Order, known as Baladites. It is {{dedicated}} to Saint Anthony the Great. It is commonly called Qozhaya, in reference to the valley in which it is located. The valley of Qozhaya, along with the valley of Qannoubine to which it is connected to the west, form what is called the valley of Qadisha. Qozhaya is considered {{to be one of the}} oldest monasteries of the valley of Qadisha. Several hermitages are attached to it and at a certain period (probably the 12th Century AD), it has been the See of the Maronite Patriarch. In 1584, the first printing press of the Middle East was installed in this monastery. In 1708, it was handed down to the newly formed Lebanese Maronite Order. It still belongs to this important Order. Qozhaya was at its pinnacle in the first part of the 19th Century with more than 300 monks belonging to it. With its large properties in the valley, in Ain-Baqra and in Jedaydeh, Qozhaya is one of the richest monasteries of the Order.

25|$|In {{the area}} {{surrounding}} Cato's Sabine farm were {{the lands of}} Lucius Valerius Flaccus, a young nobleman of significant influence and high patrician family. Flaccus could not help remarking on Cato's energy, his military talent, his eloquence, his frugal and simple life, and his traditional principles. Flaccus himself {{was a member of}} that purist patrician faction which displayed its adherence to the stricter virtues of the ancient Roman character. Within Roman society a transition was in progress—from Samnite rusticity to Grecian civilization and oriental voluptuousness. The chief magistracies of the state had become almost the patrimony of a few distinguished families whose wealth corresponded to their upper-class birth. Popular by acts of graceful but corrupting generosity, by charming manners, and by the appeal of hereditary honours, they collected the material power granted by a multitude of clients and followers, as well as the intellectual power provided by their monopoly on philosophical education, by their taste in the fine arts, and by their knowledge of stylish literature. Nevertheless, the reaction to them was strong. <b>The</b> <b>less</b> <b>fortunate</b> nobles, jealous of this exclusive oligarchy, and openly watchful of the decadence and disorder associated with luxury, placed themselves {{at the head of a}} party which showed its determination to rely on purer models and to attach much importance to the ancient ways. In their eyes, rusticity, austerity, and asceticism were the marks of Sabine robustness and religion and of the old Roman inflexible integrity and love of order. Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Scipio Africanus and his family, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, may be taken as representative of the new civilization; Cato's friends, Fabius and Flaccus, were the leading men in the faction defending the old plainness.|$|E

The possibility that a new creek might suddenly produce gold, however, continued to tempt poorer prospectors.

500|$|Riley {{is often}} remembered for {{his most famous}} poems, {{including}} [...] "The Raggedy Man" [...] and [...] "Little Orphant Annie". Many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for subject matter. His poems often contained morals and warnings for children, containing messages telling children to care for <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>fortunate</b> of society. David Galens and Van Allen both see these messages as Riley's subtle response to the turbulent economic times of the Gilded Age and the growing progressive movement. Riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity, and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities. His children's poems are [...] "exuberant, performative, and often display Riley's penchant for using humorous characterization, repetition, and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wide-ranging audience." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his tenure}} Kennedy {{became one of}} the most {{recognizable}} and influential members of his party, and was sometimes called a [...] "Democratic icon" [...] as well as [...] "The Lion of the Senate". Kennedy and his Senate staff authored around 2,500bills, of which more than 300 were enacted into law. Kennedy co-sponsored another 550bills that became law after 1973. Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee. During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship. Kennedy strongly believed in the principle [...] "never let the perfect be the enemy of the good," [...] and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it down the road. In April 2006, Kennedy was selected by Time as one of [...] "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine noted that he had [...] "amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country" [...] and that [...] "by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him". In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, [...] " [...] is a legendary lawmaker and I have the highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner." [...] Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative Arnold Schwarzenegger described [...] "Uncle Teddy" [...] as [...] "a liberal icon, a warrior for <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>fortunate,</b> a fierce advocate for health-care reform, a champion of social justice here and abroad" [...] and [...] "the rock of his family".
