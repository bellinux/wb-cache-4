5|$|While jaguars {{now live}} only in the Americas, they are descended from Old World cats. Two million years ago, {{scientists}} believe, the jaguar and its closest relative, the similarly spotted leopard, shared a common ancestor in Asia. In the Early Pleistocene, the forerunners of modern jaguars crossed Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait and connected Asia and North America. These jaguar ancestors then moved south into Central and South America, feeding on <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> other grazing animals that once covered the landscape in huge herds.|$|E
5|$|In the Jataka {{tales of}} the Buddha's {{previous}} lives, there is narration related to his birth as Boddhisattva in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer. This story is of one compassion of the deer shown towards the King who wanted to hunt the deer. The King, while trying to hunt the deer, fell into a precipice with his horse. The deer instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by the compassion shown by <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> mule <b>deer</b> can {{be divided}} into two main groups: <b>The</b> mule <b>deer</b> (sensu stricto) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> <b>The</b> first group {{includes}} all subspecies, except O. h. columbianus and O. h. sitkensis, which are in <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group. <b>The</b> two main groups have been treated as separate species, but they hybridize, and virtually all recent authorities treat <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> as conspecific. It appears <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> evolved from <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> Despite this, <b>the</b> mtDNA of <b>the</b> white-tailed <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> mule <b>deer</b> are similar, but differ from that of <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> This {{may be the result of}} introgression, although hybrids between <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> white-tailed <b>deer</b> are rare in the wild (apparently more common locally in West Texas), and the hybrid survival rate is low even in captivity. Many claims of observations of wild hybrids are not legitimate, as identification based on external features is complicated.|$|R

5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana (5th to 4th century BCE) by Valmiki {{does not}} mention Maya Sita. Sita, the princess of Mithila, is married to Rama, the prince of Ayodhya. Rama is forced {{to go on a}} 14-year exile and is {{accompanied}} by Sita and his brother Lakshmana. Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, plots to abduct Sita, aided by Maricha, who transforms into a magical golden deer (Maya mriga, an illusional deer), that entices Sita. While in exile in Dandaka forest, Rama goes after <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> <b>and</b> slays it. The magical deer gives a call of help in Rama's voice. Sita forces Lakshmana to go and help Rama, leaving her alone. Ravana comes disguised as an ascetic and kidnaps her. He imprisons her in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. When Rama doubts Sita's chastity, she undergoes a trial by fire (Agni Pariksha). Sita enters a burning pyre declaring that if she has been faithful to Rama let the fire not harm her; she comes out unscathed with the fire-god Agni as proof of her purity. Rama accepts Sita back and returns to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{showed his}} first {{paintings}} publicly in The Hague, {{where they were}} exhibited from April to May 1917 at the Kunstzaal Pictura. In December 1919, he was accepted as a select member to the Haagse Kunstkring, an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the Ridderzaal. He painted the tame roe deer belonging to Princess Juliana in his studio at The Hague, opposite the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch. He made many sketches and drawings of <b>the</b> <b>deer,</b> <b>and</b> painted Hertje (The fawn) in 1921, which became quite popular in the Netherlands. He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium, France, Italy, and England, and acquired {{a name for himself}} as a talented portraitist. He earned stately fees through commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the Côte d'Azur. His clients were impressed by his understanding of the 17th-century techniques of the Dutch masters. Throughout his life, van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature.|$|E
50|$|Though it {{has been}} argued that <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> is a species, {{virtually}} all recent authorities maintain it as a subspecies of <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus hemionus). Strictly speaking, <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group consists of two subspecies, as it also includes O. h. sitkensis (Sitka black-tailed <b>deer).</b> <b>The</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> group (sensu stricto) hybridize, <b>and</b> mule <b>deer</b> appear to have evolved from <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group.

25|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Deer</b> <b>and</b> the Cauldron, Cha {{intentionally}} {{created an}} anticlimax and an antihero in Wei Xiaobao, who possesses {{none of the}} desirable traditional values and no knowledge in any form of martial arts, and depends on a protective vest made of alloy to absorb full-frontal attack when in trouble, and a dagger that can cut through anything. Wei was a street urchin and a womanising weasel, with no admirable qualities whatsoever. The fiction writer Ni Kuang wrote a connected critique of all of Cha's works and concluded that Cha concluded his work with <b>The</b> <b>Deer</b> <b>and</b> the Cauldron as a satire to his earlier work, and a reminder to the readers for a reality check.|$|E
