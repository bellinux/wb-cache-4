5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>at</b> hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> <b>At</b> first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> <b>At</b> the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E

5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according to the nature of <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>at</b> hand, and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} to the spirit of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the crease, without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>at</b> hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} cutting the ditch around Conwy Castle {{within days of}} Edward's decision. The work was {{controlled}} by Sir John Bonvillars and overseen by master mason James of St. George, and {{the first phase of}} work between 1283 and 1284 focused on creating the exterior curtain walls and towers. In the second phase, from 1284 and 1286, the interior buildings were erected, while work began on the walls for the neighbouring town. By 1287, the castle was complete. The builders recruited huge numbers of labourers from across England for <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> <b>At</b> each summer building season the labourers massed at Chester and then walked into Wales. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, but the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E

5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>at</b> hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E

Consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.|$|E
25|$|When {{an older}} {{individual}} is completing a task, {{such as having}} a conversation or doing work, they are using their working memory to help them complete this task. As they age, their ability to multi-task seems to decline; thus after an interruption it is often more difficult for an aging individual to successfully finish <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>at</b> hand. Additionally, working memory {{plays a role in}} the comprehension and production of speech. There is often a decline in sentence comprehension and sentence production as individuals age. Rather than linking this decline directly to deficits in linguistic ability, it is actually deficits in working memory that contribute to these decreasing language skills.|$|E
