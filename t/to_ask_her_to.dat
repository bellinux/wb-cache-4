She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E

5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} also {{important}} in the main story arc concerning the cracks in time and space. The idea of the crack {{was inspired by a}} similar crack in the wall of Moffat's son. As the crack reappears, several facts about it are revealed. In the episode, the Doctor speculates that they are connected to the fact that Amy could not remember the events of several previous episodes, as well as events in history that had occurred in [...] "The Next Doctor". He also discovers that the time explosion that caused the crack is 26 June 2010, which is also the original airdate of the final episode of the series, [...] "The Big Bang". Before the Doctor, River, and Octavian leave Amy and the other clerics, the Doctor briefly returns to console Amy and <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> trust him and remember what he told her when she was younger; however, the Doctor in this scene is shown wearing his jacket, which he had lost to the Angels earlier in the episode, as well as a different wristwatch.

River Song tells the Doctor she will see him again when the Pandorica opens; the Pandorica was previously referred to by Prisoner Zero in [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] and is revealed in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", which also sees the return of River Song.|$|E

We were always good friends with that period of Fairport Convention. Richard Thompson is a superlative guitarist. Sandy and I were friends, {{and it was the}} most obvious thing <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sing on [...] "The Battle of Evermore".

2500|$|Nixon's {{involvement}} in Watergate brought disgrace and a forced resignation in 1974 and any long-term movement toward the GOP {{was interrupted by}} the scandal. Gerald Ford succeeded Nixon {{and gave him a}} full pardon—thereby giving the Democrats a powerful issue they used to sweep the 1974 off-year elections. Ford never fully recovered and in 1976 he barely defeated Ronald Reagan for the nomination. The one positive to come from Ford's brief presidency was the outspoken personality of First Lady Betty Ford. Ford took several liberal positions on social issues regarding breast cancer awareness following her Mastectomy in 1974. To add to her outspoken persona, she was a staunch supporter of and activist for the Equal Rights Amendment, (ERA). Pro-choice on abortion and a leader in the women's movement, she gained fame {{as one of the most}} candid first ladies in history, commenting on every hot button issue of the time, including feminism, equal pay, the ERA, sex, drugs, abortion, civil rights, and gun control. Her liberal positions and her outspoken personality garnered her high approval ratings throughout her husband's term in office [...] despite opposition from the conservative wing of the GOP who objected to her liberal stances and even a few members of Ford's cabinet like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld advised Ford <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> tone down her outspoken views to avoid losing voters, but Ford declined to do so. Despite the candid nature of the First Lady and the end of the Vietnam War, Democrats ended up with major gains in Congress and the taint of Watergate and the nation's economic difficulties contributed to the election of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, running as a Washington outsider.|$|E
