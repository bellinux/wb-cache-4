500|$|Vladimir Yazdovsky {{made the}} final {{selection}} of dogs and their designated roles. Laika {{was to be}} the [...] "flight dog"—a sacrifice to science on a one-way mission to space. Albina, who had already flown twice on a high-altitude test rocket, was to act as Laika's backup.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, HB1002 was almost complete, with the lessons learned from the HB1001 {{incorporated}} into the aircraft, including the rebuilding of the aft fuselage. HB1002 was distinguished from the prototype in having a gray paint coat. It did not have the flight <b>test</b> <b>instrumentation</b> boom present on HB1001's nose. As the aircraft was used to test RCS returns, the unstealthy spin recovery chute was removed, and the aircraft was covered in radar-absorbent material. It first flew on 20July1978 [...] with Dyson at the controls, who would be the only pilot to fly the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|During 1943, {{a single}} Miles M.3B Falcon Six light aircraft, {{which had been}} {{previously}} used for wing tests by the RAE, was provided to Miles for purpose of performing low-speed flight testing work on the project. A full size wooden model of the M.52 wing, <b>test</b> <b>instrumentation,</b> and a different undercarriage were fitted to this aircraft. Owing to the wing's thinness and sharp {{leading and trailing edges}} somewhat resembling a razor blade, the aircraft was nicknamed the [...] "Gillette Falcon". On 11 August 1944, this low-speed demonstrator performed its maiden flight. These tests found the wing to present favourable aileron function, but also indicated that landing without flaps to be more difficult than its contemporaries. Compared with a standard Falcon Six, wing area was reduced by about 12 per cent; it had the effect of increasing the landing speed by over 50 per cent from , higher than any prior aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the second}} orbiter to be constructed, {{and the first}} able to fly into space, Columbia was roughly [...] heavier than {{subsequent}} orbiters such as Endeavour, which were of a slightly different design, and had benefited from advances in materials technology. In part, {{this was due to}} heavier wing and fuselage spars, the weight of early <b>test</b> <b>instrumentation</b> that remained fitted to the avionics suite, and an internal airlock that, originally fitted into the other orbiters, was later removed in favor of an external airlock to facilitate Shuttle/Mir and Shuttle/International Space Station dockings. Due to its weight, Columbia could not have used the planned Centaur-G booster (cancelled after the loss of Challenger). The retention of the internal airlock allowed NASA to use Columbia for the STS-109 Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, along with the Spacehab double module used on STS-107. Due to Columbia's heavier weight, it was less ideal for NASA to use it for missions to the International Space Station, though modifications were made to the Shuttle during its last refit in case the spacecraft was needed for such tasks.|$|E
