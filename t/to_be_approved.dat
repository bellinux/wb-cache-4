5|$|In January 1893, Palmer {{approached}} the House Appropriations Committee, asking that $10,000 {{of the funds}} already designated to be paid over to the Lady Managers {{by the federal government}} be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E
5|$|Membership in B'nai Israel was {{restricted}} to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined. The members also instituted rules intended to guard {{the image of the}} small Jewish congregation {{in the eyes of the}} much larger Christian community. New members had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by a secret ballot, and existing members could blackball candidates. A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E
50|$|The then President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, {{stated that}} he will support any reform to the Statute of Autonomy which is {{supported}} by 2/3 of the Basque Parliament (a verbal condition not legally written anywhere, for the only condition needed for a statute <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approve</b> <b>is</b> the half of the total plus one votes in the Basque Parliament).|$|R

50|$|The {{referendum}} was classed as {{an optional}} referendum, {{which meant that}} only {{a majority of the}} public vote was required for the proposals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approve,</b> as opposed <b>to</b> the mandatory referendums that required both a majority of voters and cantons to approve the proposals.|$|R
5|$|The Jagiellonian dynasty was not {{entitled}} to automatic hereditary succession, rather each new king had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by nobility consensus. Władysław Jagiełło had two sons late in life from his last wife Sophia of Halshany. In 1430, the nobility agreed to the succession of the future Władysław III only after the king consented {{to a series of}} concessions. In 1434, the old monarch died and his minor son Władysław was crowned; the Royal Council led by Bishop Oleśnicki undertook the regency duties.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan District {{accepted}} that {{wages and salaries}} had to be high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers. It generally allowed wages and salaries to be paid by contractors as they saw fit, subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit inflation. Salaries above $9,000 had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by Patterson and Groves.|$|E
5|$|The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was {{organised}} {{under the}} control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts and many emigrated. Books and scripts had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>approved</b> by voters and came into force on 10 December 1946.|$|R
5|$|The Secretary of State regulates flag {{protocol}} {{as well as}} {{the distribution}} and sale of the state flag. Replica flags made for commercial sale are required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the Secretary of State. The state seal on the flag must be stitched on both sides with the profile of George Washington facing the same direction, making the Washington state flag among the most expensive U.S. state flags to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} games (where the Cup {{could change}} leagues) {{are to be}} decided either in a one-game affair, a two-game total goals affair, or a best of three series, {{to the benefit of}} both teams involved.

5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and {{would be the first}} of a long series of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E

5|$|The {{constituency}} {{was created}} as per the Political Reform Act 1977 and was first contested in the 1977 general election. The Act {{provided for the}} provinces of Spain to be established as multi-member districts in the Congress of Deputies, with this regulation being maintained under the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Additionally, the Constitution requires for any modification of the provincial limits <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> under an organic law, needing an absolute majority in the Cortes Generales.|$|E
5|$|While Motts Clamato {{continues}} to be synonymous with the cocktail, other producers have begun offering alternative caesar mixes. Walter Caesar (named in honor of Chell) was launched in 2013 to offer an 'all natural' alternative to Clamato. Walter Caesar also became the first caesar mix in Canada <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by Ocean Wise by using ocean-friendly clam juice from the North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Without any {{ostensible}} heir, Cosimo contemplated {{restoring the}} Republic of Florence. However, this presented many obstacles. Florence was nominally an Imperial fief, and Siena a Spanish one. The plan was about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the powers convened at Geertruidenberg when Cosimo abruptly added that if {{himself and his}} two sons predeaceased the Electress Palatine she should succeed and the republic be re-instituted following her death. The proposal sank, and was ultimately put on hold following the Emperor Joseph's death.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of Sesame Street in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved,</b> initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E
5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> by the nobles and knights of both lands. The {{meeting between the}} nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 {{in the town of}} Nakło, where they {{confirmed}} the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} metro plans had {{not called}} for the Østensjø Line to run further than to Bøler. As housing development was gradually forcing its way further south in Nordstrand, the municipal council saw the need for extensions to the line. The section from Bøler <b>to</b> Borgerud <b>was</b> <b>approved</b> on 8 March 1963 and construction started immediately. The section from Borgerud <b>to</b> Skullerud <b>was</b> <b>approved</b> of on 31 January 1964. The total costs of the line from Helsfyr to Skullerud ended at 39 million Norwegian krone.|$|R
