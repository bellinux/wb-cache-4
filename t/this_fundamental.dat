5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. <b>This</b> <b>fundamental</b> characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E

The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories, but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard's theory. He posits that intensified conflict {{is a product of the}} imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them ‘Siamese twins'.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, there were huge forced {{population}} movements as families, mostly but not exclusively Roman Catholic, living in areas {{dominated by the}} other community were intimidated from their homes, {{either directly or indirectly}} through general fear. The general decline in European manufacturing industry of the early 1980s, exacerbated by political violence, devastated the city's economy. As recently as 1971 the city and surrounding area had a large Protestant majority, but as of 2011 is almost evenly balanced. <b>This</b> <b>fundamental</b> change in balance has been attributed to higher Catholic birth rates and rising prosperity, together with Protestant emigration (both internal, e.g., to North Down and external).|$|E

25|$|MS2 tagging: by {{incorporating}} RNA stem loops, such as MS2, into a gene, these become incorporated into newly synthesized RNA.

The recruitment of GFP {{to the site of}} transcription is visualized as a single fluorescent spot. This new approach has revealed that transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts, or pulses (see Transcriptional bursting). With the notable exception of in situ techniques, most other methods provide cell population averages, and are not capable of detecting <b>this</b> <b>fundamental</b> property of genes.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, {{achievement}} {{was once again}} accepted {{as the basis for}} admission and promotion in education. <b>This</b> <b>fundamental</b> change reflected the critical role of scientific and technical knowledge and professional skills in the Four Modernizations. Also, political activism was no longer regarded as an important measure of individual performance, and even the development of commonly approved political attitudes and political background was secondary to achievement. Education policy promoted expanded enrollments, with the long-term objective of achieving universal primary and secondary education. This policy contrasted with the previous one, which touted increased enrollments for egalitarian reasons. In 1985 the commitment to modernization was reinforced by plans for nine-year compulsory education and for providing good quality higher education.|$|E

25|$|Bubbles in {{financial}} markets {{have been studied}} not only through historical evidence, but also through experiments, mathematical and statistical works. Smith, Suchanek and Williams designed a set of experiments in which an asset that gave a dividend with expected value 24 cents {{at the end of}} each of 15 periods (and were subsequently worthless) was traded through a computer network. Classical economics would predict that the asset would start trading near $3.60 (15 times $0.24) and decline by 24 cents each period. They found instead that prices started well below <b>this</b> <b>fundamental</b> value and rose far above the expected return in dividends. The bubble subsequently crashed before the end of the experiment. This laboratory bubble has been repeated hundreds of times in many economics laboratories in the world, with similar results.|$|E
25|$|Quantum theory also {{provides}} accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as black-body radiation and {{the stability of}} the orbitals of electrons in atoms.

Even so, classical physics can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.|$|E
