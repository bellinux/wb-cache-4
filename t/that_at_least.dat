5|$|As in the 2005 season, {{the team}} {{predicted}} it was highly probable <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81%probability <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland, a 64%chance {{of at least}} one major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47%chance {{of at least one}} major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.|$|E

A recent study found <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves.
