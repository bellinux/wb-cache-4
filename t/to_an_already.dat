5|$|Following his death, {{his body}} was {{transferred}} to Constantinople and buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles there. His body survived the plundering of the city during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Constantine was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews Dalmatius (who held the rank of Caesar) and Hannibalianus, presumably to eliminate possible contenders <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> complicated succession. He also had two daughters, Constantina and Helena, wife of Emperor Julian.|$|E
5|$|His father, disapproving of Darling's {{fondness for}} sport, sent {{him away from}} his cricket and Australian rules {{football}} teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on the farm added size and strength <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> stocky and athletic frame. He was selected for the South Australian team at age 19, but his father would not allow him time off the farm to play.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E
5|$|As {{the force}} which {{was sent to}} {{reinforce}} and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties, the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed. The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months, adding fuel <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> volatile atmosphere {{in the city of}} Bjelovar, where the 105th Brigade was originally based. This tension erupted a week later, with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar. The JNA denied it had any knowledge on the fate of the Croatian soldiers. Details of their deaths became known in December 1991. Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk-91, and their bodies were exhumed in January 1992. Along with the soldiers, the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of Rakov Potok. The soldiers were re-interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992. According to JNA intelligence reports, during the period from the exhumation to the re-interment, 32 Serb-owned houses in Bjelovar were demolished in retribution for the killings.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E
25|$|In {{extremely}} humid locations, adding insulation <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> well-insulated tank {{may cause}} condensation leading to rust, mold, or other operational problems so some air flow must be maintained, usually by convection caused by waste heat, but in particularly humid conditions such ventilation may be fan-assisted.|$|E

25|$|In Germany all {{throughout}} the century, Bach was coupled to nationalist feelings, and the composer was inscribed {{in a religious}} revival.

25|$|The {{dramatic}} increase of emigration (Republikflucht, brain drain) {{in the first}} half of 1953, already high since the establishment of the GDR, constituted a serious economic and social problem. Another factor that contributed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> complicated political situation was the high number of political prisoners in the GDR. Suppression of the illegal organisation Junge Gemeinde (Young Congregation), wrongly perceived as the central youth organisation of the Evangelical Church, played a role here. Numerous trainee pastors were imprisoned (e.g. Johannes Hamel and Fritz Hoffmann). Ecclesiastic recreation centres were closed and taken over by the FDJ (e.g.: Schloss Mansfeld and Huberhaus Wernigerode). High school students who belonged to a church were often expelled by the school authorities, sometimes even shortly before school graduation.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved their factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television manufacturing operations to Suffolk, Virginia, {{and later to}} Asia. The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse, relocated its manufacturing operations out of state, and outsourced some of its production to Asian facilities. Nevertheless, although city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, even growing by 2.5 percent since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far {{below the national average}} during that period.|$|E

25|$|The {{region in}} which Lake Ilo NWR is located {{was one of}} the last to be settled by white {{settlers}} on the Great Plains of the United States. By the 1930s, the era of the Dust Bowl brought drought and dust storms <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> arid region. Starting in 1936, local citizens were hired by the U.S. Government to build a dam at the confluence of two creeks, which would help create a more sustainable water supply for the immediate area since no sizeable bodies of water existed in this region of North Dakota. The dam was completed in 1938 and the following year, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a congressional bill designating the new lake and the surrounding area as a National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
25|$|On October 22, 2013, the Dodgers {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Cuban middle-infielder Alexander Guerrero to a four-year deal, worth $32 million with incentives.

On December 5, the Dodgers re-signed relief pitcher Brian Wilson to a one-year, $10 million contract, that included a player option for 2015 and on December 14, they agreed to terms with third baseman Juan Uribe on a two-year, $15 million, extension. On December 17, relief pitcher J. P. Howell re-signed on a two-year, $11.25 million, contract.

25|$|Connauton {{began his}} junior {{career in the}} AJHL with the Spruce Grove Saints in 2007–08. He {{recorded}} 13 goals and 45 points over 56 games – first among rookie defencemen and third among defencemen overall – to earn a {{rookie of the year}} nomination and a unanimous selection to the AJHL North All-Rookie Team. He garnered interest from the Vancouver Giants of the WHL, who put him on their protected list in October 2008, but opted to play college hockey instead in the NCAA. He signed with the Western Michigan Broncos of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) in April 2008 and initially intended to join them for the 2009–10 season, due <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>already</b> full defensive corps. However, after Jesse Perrin departed for the Central Hockey League (CHL) in August 2008, Connauton was invited to join the Broncos for the 2008–09 season.
