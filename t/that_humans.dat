5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach is the fact <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy {{in a number of}} imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> would question its reliability. Swinburne argued <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E

In general, few small animals became extinct on Madagascar, except for these rodents, two species of Plesiorycteropus, and the shrew tenrec Microgale macpheei; in contrast, large animals such as subfossil lemurs, the {{carnivore}} Cryptoprocta spelea, Malagasy hippopotamuses, Dipsochelys tortoises, and Aepyornis and Mullerornis birds all became extinct around the time <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> arrived.|$|E
5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount <b>that</b> <b>humans,</b> being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms.

For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips {{published}} The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God in 2004, {{presenting a}} challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work <b>that</b> <b>humans</b> are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence. With reference to the suffering of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.|$|E
