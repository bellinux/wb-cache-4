Using data from video recordings of 52 interactions between six mothers and their young children, this article examines one particular kind of sequence in which interactionally ordered child laughter occurs. In that sequence, the young child commits some kind of potential transgression (e. g., breaking wind, standing on objects on the floor, or playing in a proscribed location). The child's mother then {{draws attention to the}} potential transgression in some way (e. g., by admonishing the child, requesting a change to the child's behavior, issuing a particular kind of child-directed gaze), thus treating the child's action as constituting a transgression. At some point following the potential transgression, the child laughs. What is shown is that even young children can fit their laughter to the ongoing interactional sequence. It is argued that the child's laughter provides for a display of affiliation from <b>the</b> <b>mothe...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: How much {{economic}} mobility {{is there}} across generations in a poor, primarily rural, economy? How much do intergenerational linkages contribute to current inequality? We address these questions using original survey data on Senegal that include an individualized measure of consumption. While intergenerational linkages are evident, {{we find a}} relatively high degree of mobility across generations, associated with the shift from farm to non-farm sectors and greater economic activity of women. Male-dominated bequests of land and housing bring little gain to consumption and play little role in explaining inequality, though they have important effects on sector of activity. Inheritance of non-land assets and the education and occupation of parents (especially the mother) and their choices about children's schooling are more important to adult welfare than property inheritance. Significant gender inequality in consumption is evident, though it is almost entirely explicable in terms of factors such as education and (non-land) inheritance. There {{are a number of}} other pronounced gender differences, with intergenerational linkages coming through <b>the</b> <b>mothe...</b>|$|E

A special curvilinear coordinate system is proposed to analytically include realistic ventricular shape and myofiber directions. With this anatomical model, electrophysiological simulations can be performed on a rectangular coordinate grid. We apply our method to study the effect of fiber rotation and electrical anisotropy of cardiac tissue (i. e., {{the ratio of the}} conductivity coefficients along and across the myocardial fibers) on wave propagation using the ten Tusscher–Panfilov (2006) ionic model for human ventricular cells. We show that fiber rotation increases the speed of cardiac activation and attenuates the effects of anisotropy. Our results show that the fiber rotation in the heart is an important factor underlying cardiac excitation. We also study scroll wave dynamics in our model and show the drift of a scroll wave filament whose velocity depends non-monotonically on the fiber rotation angle; the period of scroll wave rotation decreases with an increase of the fiber rotation angle; an increase in anisotropy may cause the breakup of a scroll wave, similar to <b>the</b> <b>mothe...</b>|$|E

Eleven fetal lambs (gestational age 125 - 133 d) were chronically instrumented with a catheter in a hindlimb artery and vein and a forelimb artery; a carotid arterial oximeter catheter was placed in six of these fetuses. An inflatable cuff occluder was placed around the maternal hypogastric artery. Acute fetal hypoxemia was induced repeatedly by reducing uterine blood flow. Fetal heart rate, arterial pressure, and carotid arterial oxygen saturation were monitored continuously before and after administering ketamine, morphine, pentobarbital, or propranolol to the fetus. The ratio delta heart rate/delta O 2 saturation has been shown previously to be a reproducible index of chemoreflex response. The differences in baseline values and changes with drugs were compared by multiple regression analysis coded by effects. Chemoreflex response was markedly attenuated by ketamine and morphine but not by pentobarbital or propranolol.

Overweight and obesity were defined based on body mass index (BMI) using the IOTF cut-off points. To evaluate the rates of overweight and obesity occurrence in children with regard to family socio-economic status, parental level of education, the number of children in the family, and the place of residence (divided into city and village) was used. ‘Only children’ were the most likely group to be overweight or obese.

Based on the transactional model of development, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether developmental parenting trajectories mediated or moderated the relation between gestational age and problem behavior. Longitudinal data were collected from mothers of 104 full-term and 126 moderate preterm children in the Netherlands. Mothers filled out questionnaires on four parenting dimensions (warmth, stimulation, structure and discipline) and problem behavior of the child when their child was 12, 18, 24 and 36 months old. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling in Mplus. Results showed that warmth, stimulation and discipline remained relatively stable over the first two years of the child’s life. No differences were found between mothers of full-term and moderate preterm children concerning parenting. Parenting did not mediate the relation between gestational age and problem behavior, but warmth, stimulation and discipline did moderate this relation and, therefore, functioned as a protective factor for later development of problem behavior. As moderate preterm children were found to be at increased risk for internalizing problem behavior, positive parenting might even be more important for this group of children. These findings suggest that effective parenting interventions should focus enhancing warmth, stimulation and positive disciplining behavior of <b>the</b> <b>mothe...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann {{syndrome}} (BFLS; MIM 301900) is an infrequently described X linked disorder {{caused by}} mutations in PHF 6, a novel zinc finger gene of unknown function. OBJECTIVE: To {{present the results}} of mutation screening in individuals referred for PHF 6 testing and discuss the value of prior X-inactivation testing in the mothers of these individuals. RESULTS: 25 unrelated individuals were screened (24 male, one female). Five PHF 6 mutations were detected, two of which (c. 940 A [...] >G and c. 27 _ 28 insA) were novel. One of these new mutations, c. 27 _ 28 insA, was identified in a female BFLS patient. This was {{shown to be a}} de novo mutation arising on the paternal chromosome. This is the first report of a clinically diagnosed BFLS female with a confirmed PHF 6 mutation. In addition, the X-inactivation status of the mothers of 19 males with suggested clinical diagnosis of BFLS was determined. Skewed (> or = 70 %) X-inactivation was present in five mothers, three of whom had sons in whom a PHF 6 mutation was detected. The mutation positive female also showed skewing. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the success of PHF 6 screening in males suspected of having BFLS is markedly increased if there is a positive family history and/or skewed X-inactivation is found in <b>the</b> <b>mothe...</b>|$|E

40|$|For salmonids, the smolting process {{includes}} substantial morphological, {{physiological and}} behavioral changes {{all of which}} must coincide to ensure the greatest chance of survival in the marine environment. Therefore, understanding how environmental parameters influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications. I used historical data and a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the role of both temperature and flow on the timing of migration in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts. An Information Theoretic Model Comparison (ITMC) technique was used to correlate 13 years of historical smolt migration data from the Nechako River in central British Columbia, Canada with data on temperature and discharge from the same period. A combination of temperature experience (accumulated thermal units ATU) and flow discharge were best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, ATU consistently performed better than daily mean temperature suggesting that temperature experience plays {{a larger role in}} the migration process than a temperature threshold. In a laboratory experiment, temperature manipulation affected growth and development of physiological smolt characteristics. In addition, fish in tanks with increasing temperature showed earlier movement than those in constant temperature tanks. Flow velocity was not found to have an effect on physiological development of smolt characteristics and did not appear to affect timing of migration in the absence of increasing temperature. However, velocity did influence the pattern of migration, since the presence of a strong, directional flow resulted in a well defined migration event with a clear increase, peak and decrease in movement regardless of the temperature manipulation. Alternatively, fish in experimental tanks without increased flow showed either pulses of movement or no clearly defined movement period.

40|$|The studies {{contained}} in this dissertation {{were conducted to}} examine potential connections between neurophysiological measures of face processing and behavioral responses to structured mother-child interactions in two ages that have been implicated as developmental transitions in both the face processing literature and the mother-child attachment literature. Chapter's I and II present data from a study that examined a relationship between 6 -month-olds' responses {{to a series of}} separations and reunions with the mother and the same infant's event-related potential (ERP) responses to mother and stranger faces. In Chapter I, a composite measure of infant behavior was used as a general index of amount of proximity and interaction seeking behaviors. Chapter II extended this investigation to examine three specific behaviors that have been implicated as highly influential {{in the development of the}} mother-child relationship during the first year. Taken together, the results of these two chapters suggest that a general measure of amount of proximity seeking exhibited by infants was associated with larger ERP responses to the stranger's face. However, the specific behaviors examined in Chapter II correlated with the identity of the two faces in unique and specific ways, although distress during separations seemed to be particularly related to neural responses to the mother's face. Chapter III presents data from a study conducted with toddlers (28 to 40 months) using the same paradigm. Potential age-related changes in the neural correlates of processing the two faces were examined in this age range as well, as they have not been found in previous work. The findings presented in Chapter III indicated evidence of age-related change in processing faces in general, as well as the identity of the mother and stranger faces in this age range. In addition, related to the findings in Chapter III, toddler distress behaviors during separation were particularly related to neural responses to the mother's face.

If this asynchronous motor can be well understand {{and meet the}} requirements, it could be applied for several products. With not much research {{on this kind of}} motor, the understanding and model of the motor itself is a valuable project. In this thesis a theory model for the special structure asynchronous motor is introduced. Simulation base on the model has been done. After these a practical motor is made for the measurement. Measurement setup is designed and made, including power electronic power supply for the asynchronous motor. The characteristics of the asynchronous motor are measured. From the measurement results the most important problem is that the asynchronous motor tends to run at lower speed with respect to the synchronous speed. To understand this much effort is made. Improvement of <b>the</b> measuring <b>mothed</b> and power supply quality is tried. Influence of the motor structure is investigated, such as closing ring and self-inductance of the windings. Theory calculation are make to explain the low running speed, including the eccentric rotor influence and space harmonics.

Conclusions are made that the low running speed could be a reason of the low speed traveling wave or the additional friction in the system.
