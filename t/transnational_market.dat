However, more commonly, smugglers engage and do business within a larger smuggling network where there is a division of work among the actors involved. In the past, smuggling rings tended to be more obscure, amateurish, and limited. As people smuggling has continued to grow, however, smuggling rings are far more extensive and organized. In Mexico, as Jim Chaparro—head of the anti-smuggling office at the US Immigration and Naturalization Service—puts it, the once small and informal smuggling business has evolved into a powerful web of [...] "literally hundreds of syndicates, some at a low level and some at the kingpin level". (In fact, as the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States from Mexico has become more organized, there has opened an opportunity for smuggling groups within Mexico to market their services to non-Mexicans. Indeed, smuggling operations are often complex and smuggled persons often make stops at countries across the globe before arriving at their final destination.) ...|$|E

40|$|The Qualitex {{decision}} in 1995 inspired trademark reformation and harmonization worldwide {{for the protection}} of color marks. While protecting color trademarks has not created issues of market entry in domestic markets, the {{growth in the number of}} <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> participants and an increased utilization of non-traditional branding may catalyze color depletion in international trade. After exploring how current advertising expenditure requirements and distinctiveness requirements affect the registrability and protection of a color mark, this Note offers potential global reforms to help minimize hurdles for small scale transnational participants and the threat of international color depletion. Specifically, due to consumers 2 ̆ 7 increasing exposure to international brands through e-commerce, courts should give more deference to survey results on Internet platforms to establish distinctiveness in the brand 2 ̆ 7 s relevant customer base. The proposals in this Note will benefit trademark owners and potential <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> participants by ensuring that consumer confusion is based on actual market practices, which will in turn prevent color depletion by keeping widely used colors in the public domain. Ultimately, by remaining conscious of the facts and issues presented in this Note, attorneys, legislators, and trademark owners can ensure fair market competition and mitigate color depletion from taking place in transnational trade...|$|E

It analyzes the drivers of regulatory change and explores the conditions under which post-Soviet economies integrate with international markets.

Furthermore, through the study of the impact of Western and Russian transnational actors, the book concludes that Russia’s presence does not necessarily hinder the integration of the EU’s Eastern neighbours with international markets.

40|$|Abstract: This paper argues {{against the}} widely shared {{assumption}} that the coordination of markets depends primarily or exclusively on institutions {{at the level of}} the nation state. It shows instead that coordination problems of "global " markets can be addressed through a variety of governance mechanisms combining different forms of private and public authority. This is illustrated through an analysis of long-distance exchange networks and cross-border markets in late mediaeval Europe, which emerged and operated within a polycentric and multilayered transjurisdictional system long before the rise of the nation state. The paper concludes that a comparison of different historical forms of <b>transnational</b> <b>markets</b> can open new perspectives for analyzing the contemporary era of globalization. ...|$|R

Second, I pro-vide an overview of the ‘constitutionalization’ of the treaty system, and survey the activities of the European Court. Among other things, constitutionalization secured property rights for <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> actors, expanded the discretionary powers of national judges, and re-duced the EC’s intergovernmental character.

40|$|The role {{of small}} and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) in the economic and social development of the advanced and developing countries is well established. SMEs operating in a <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> must constantly adapt to changing and turbulent organization environment and search for new possibilities of gaining competitive advantage. To face this challenge, SMEs base their operation on collaboration within Virtual Organizations (VOs). VO operation is based on collaborative processes. Due to dynamism and required flexibility of collaborative processes, existing business information systems are insufficient to efficiently support them. In this paper, a novel RMV method for supporting collaborative processes based on process mining techniques is proposed. The RMV method allows activity patterns in various instances of collaborative processes to be identified and used for recommendation of activities. This method provides an opportunity for better computer support of collaborative processes leading to more efficient and effective cooperation {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises...|$|E

The focus is on three emerging trends that result from stalemates in intergovernmental negotiations, but may also further complicate decision-making.

The results emphasise the instability inherent in MJVs, and in most cases instability reflected poor performance rather than the evolution of a successful venture in the foreign market. Companies were found to undertake MJVs in order to protect and control existing market positions in the foreign country rather than gain access. Little attempt was made to transfer knowledge and expertise between the partners. Under these conditions instability resulted in the failure of the parent company to achieve its primary objective: the protection of marketing assets in the foreign market.

30|$|Secondly, {{while our}} study {{includes}} a comparative case study perspective, despite the case variance and the political-institutional differences, our data show more similarities than differences.

In Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden we observed similar cost minimisation strategies by employers next to investment or compliance strategies of employees. This absence of differences {{could be related to}} the specific case studies, but it can probably be better explained by the overall framework of Europe as an ‘Internal Market’ in which market forces and liberal strategies play upon capital and labour actors in a way that overrides national differences. It shows that despite all the particularities of our cases, that transitory regimes, political composition and institutional outlook play a minor role in influencing <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> processes. Our comparative perspective shows in any case that the phenomena we observed are not limited to member-state borders at all.

40|$|Few {{issues have}} gained such {{universal}} support {{as the right}} of all children {{to be free from}} sexual abuse. All countries of the world but two have signed the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Article 34 of which stipulates that State Parties have the obligation to protect children from “all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse”. Children are most likely to experience sexual exploitation or abuse {{at the hands of a}} family member or of someone known to them. There is also evidence, however, that over and above intra-familial sexual abuse, there exists a <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> for the sexual services of children. The general pattern is that “tourists ” from developed countries (including Australia) seek out the sexual services of children in developing countries. Children in these countries may be vulnerable to sexual exploitation due to poverty, social dislocation, family breakdown, and prior experiences of sexual victimisation, and/or homelessness. In some cases, children may actively seek out customers for their sexual services as a means of economic survival. These circumstances do not change the fact that sexual activity with children is universally condemned as an abuse of human rights and is, in many countries, a crime.

It explains how and why private groups acquire a decision-making and implementation role and furthermore, explores the issues of authority and legitimacy that follow. The article illustrates these points by focusing on the Group of Thirty, one such private organisation that has exerted considerable influence. More specifically, the analysis traces the policy influence of this group on the regulatory and supervisory framework of over-the-counter derivatives. Finally, the article shifts the attention to some of the implications of private sector involvement in policy and the potential risks to systemic stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Portuguese entertainment market {{and the rise of}} several types of musical theatre are inextricably bound to the complex symbolic and material process through which Portugal was established, presented, developed, and commodified as a modern nation-state between 1865 and 1908. During this period, several fundamental transformations that merged urban planning, everyday life, and modernity took place in Lisbon. In this process, leisure activities began to include new forms of music theatre (such as operetta and the revue theatre) that became an important site for the display of modernity, representing and commodifying the nation. Despite its colonial possessions, Portugal was a peripheral European country where modernity developed in a specific way. The commodification of music associated with both music publishing and mechanical music fostered the creation of a <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> for goods in a period when most of the trade was conducted with or within national economies. In this context, the Portuguese entertainment market reflected a particular form of negotiation between the local, the national and the global levels, in which gender, class, ethnicity, and technology intertwined with theatrical repertoires, street sounds and domestic music making.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} ways in which literary and poetry books travel across the globe. First, I ask quantitatively from which foreign languages fiction and poetry books are translated into Dutch and how these translation flows developed between 1980 and 2009. To do so, I construct a dataset of all fiction and poetry books published in the Netherlands in this period to analyze translation flows {{within the context of the}} entire book production in fiction and poetry. Secondly, I asked qualitatively how translations come about in practice and how the <b>transnational</b> <b>market</b> for transnational rights is organized. I study the practices of New York literary scouts that work for Dutch (and other) publishers to help them select the most interesting manuscripts from the Anglo-American literary field. Furthermore, I analyze the practices of Dutch acquiring editors who are responsible for deciding which books to publish. In other words, I sought to understand how the process of cultural globalization, defined in this thesis as ‘the growing international diffusion, exchange, and intermingling of cultural goods and media products’ (Janssen, Kuipers & Verboord, 2008 : 720), is made possible in practice in the literary field. In combining large-scale quantitative data with in-depth qualitative data, I attempt to examine the whole of the translation processes, not only the translation flows on an aggregate level, but also the micro-sociological and meso-sociological processes that underlie these translation flows...|$|E

This article examines some attempts to re-nationalise global sushi, both from the Japanese state and from the vernacular media.

40|$|The {{efforts by}} the world’s most {{powerful}} corporations to develop global markets have spawned a substantial sociological and economic literature on how <b>transnational</b> <b>markets</b> form, what stages characterize market development, and what rules of exchange are most effective. As the authors of a prominent article put it, “…the central question is…what kinds of rules and structures promote market activity and what kinds stifle it” (Fligstein and Stone Sweet 2002 : 1212). Such a goal assumes market activity to be a per se good, part of the grand globalization blueprint for a better society. But as Robert Merton emphasized throughout his writings, such grand purposive actions may have unintended consequences and serve latent functions or dysfunctions. Alejandro Portes (2000), in his extension of Merton’s analytic framework, adds four other possibilities pertinent to good research on globalization: concealed goals to achieve covert ends, emergent means and altered outcomes, backfire or results contrary to those intended, and unexpected changes that facilitate outcomes or frustrate them. ...|$|R

The continuous role of state law in shaping transnational private legal orders is guaranteed because the latter operate with the endorsement and support of states. In this way states facilitate globalization. At the same time, the impact of state laws is fragmentary and disintegrates the applicable global private legal framework. Finally, the scattered influence of state laws undermines the protection offered to consumers. This is particularly important, because mutual rights and obligations between transnational private rule-makers, like the online platform PayPal, and their ‘users’ tend to be strongly biased in favour of the former...|$|R
