5|$|During his lifetime, List {{became a}} {{well-known}} figure among the nationalist and völkisch subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing {{the work of}} many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>List</b> Society, influenced later völkisch {{groups such as the}} Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden, and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning Nazi Party and the SS. After World War II his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and Heathen practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E

Several bank runs occurred outside the US in 1907: in Egypt in April and May; in Japan in May and June; in Hamburg and Chile in early October. The fall season was always a vulnerable time for the banking system—combined with the roiled stock market, even a small shock could have grave repercussions.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{starred in}} The Dead Pool (1988), {{the fifth and}} final film in the Dirty Harry series. It co-starred Patricia Clarkson, Liam Neeson, and a young Jim Carrey who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and {{the first of the}} victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film {{director}} Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called [...] "Dead Pool". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. The Dead Pool grossed nearly $38million, relatively low receipts for a Dirty Harry film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.|$|E

2500|$|Bubble sort, {{sometimes}} referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements [...] "bubble" [...] {{to the top of the}} list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. [...] It can be practical if the input is usually in sorted order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.|$|E

His argument was that BioWare did not deliver on the promise of its game, saying, [...] "after reading <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of promises about the ending of the game they made in their advertising campaign and PR interviews, {{it was clear that the}} product we got did not live up to any of those claims." [...] However, with the release of the extended cut, he is now happy with the end product.|$|E
