40|$|AbstractUntil recently, the {{automotive}} industry was solely relying on one energy resource: oil. However, because of several environmental, political and economical issues, new alternatives are now emerging, such as electric vehicles (EVs). The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of an EV are linked with the manufacturing {{of the car and}} the electricity production during the use phase. In this article, we study the GHG emissions linked with EVs using photovoltaic (PV) and wind electricity associated with a Renault EV. GHG emissions are compared with EVs using average electricity from various European countries and from conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The results show that using wind electricity always allows decreasing GHG emissions while PV impact is dependent on the country studied. Nonetheless, when using PV electricity, GHG emissions are always lower than conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|E

30|$|It must {{be pointed}} out that, {{it is not enough}} to replace the <b>thermal</b> <b>{{vehicles}}</b> by vehicles that have zero emissions locally in the area of operation, for example electric vehicles. We must also be certain that the chain of production of materials used to manufacture these vehicles and to produce the energy used by these vehicles during their operation life does not contribute to climate change and to pollution of the earth. This problem is certainly the most difficult to face in several countries that do not have the necessary natural resources. Well-to-wheel studies are needed in each country in order to evaluate each one of the new vehicle-technologies with respect to CO 2 emissions and energy consumption, given the energy mix used in each country for electric energy production.|$|E

We used 6671 visual images and 4005 thermal images as a training set and 767 visual vehicle images and 447 <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicle</b> images as a test-set. To classify the thermal images, we identified vehicle objects then extracted the shapes of the fronts of the cars. We then classified the vehicles in six types based on their texture.|$|R

40|$|Transport {{is a key}} {{economic}} sector, supporting {{economic development}} and growth, and facilitating exchange. At the same time, motor vehicles are major emitters of gaseous and particulate pollution in urban areas. The transport industry's quest to limit {{its impact on the}} environment and improve road safety continues to drive policy, research and development. Eco-driving is a well-established, affordable and simple behavioural change intervention, which could reduce fuel consumption up to 20 %. Fully electric vehicles are predicted to be available for the mass market by 2020, however an energy efficient driving style will still be necessary for these vehicles due to a relatively poor battery performance. Furthermore Eco-driving could be applied to electric or <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Despite a widespread adoption of Eco-driving, its safety benefits have not been clearly established. This paper discusses research issues related to Eco-driving interventions. It covers policy, industry practice and research approaches ranging from education to in-vehicle technology. This paper demonstrates the lack of comprehensive systemic research analyzing the impacts of Eco-driving on road safety. Most of the methods used to assess the benefits of eco-driving lack scientific rigour and have methodological shortcomings. Ecological Driving Assistance Systems (EDAS) has emerged as a viable ITS intervention addressing Eco-driving but the associated Human Machine Interface is still neglected. Furthermore, there is not enough research assessing the long-term effects of Eco-driving driving...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{hybridization}} of {{the conventional}} <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicles</b> nowadays constitutes a paramount importance for car manufacturers, facing the challenge of minimizing the consumption of the road transport. Although hybrid power train technologies did not converge towards a single solution, series/parallel power trains with power-split electromechanical transmissions {{prove to be the}} most promising hybrid technology. In fact, these power trains show maximum power train overall efficiency and maximum fuel reduction in almost all driving conditions compared to the conventional and other hybrid power trains. This paper addresses the model and design of the electro-mechanical configuration {{of one of the most}} effective HEV power trains: case study of the 2 nd generation Prius. It presents the simulation work of the overall operation of the Toyota Hybrid System (THS-II) of the Prius, and explores not only its power-split eCVT innovative transmission system but also its overall supervision controller for energy management. The kinematic and dynamic behaviors of the THS-II power train are explained based on the power-split aspect of its transmission through a planetary gear train. Then, the possible regular driving functionalities that result from its eCVT operation and the energy flow within its power train are outlined. A feed-forward dynamic model of the studied power train is next proposed, supervised by a rule-based engineering intuition controller. The energy consumption of the THS-II proposed model has been validated by comparing simulation results to published results on European, American and Japanese regulatory driving cycles...|$|E
40|$|A single module {{radiator}} {{within a}} dual loop <b>vehicle</b> <b>thermal</b> management setup was investigated {{as a method}} for reducing the vehicle power consumption when the air conditioner was operating.

The total vehicle power consumption improved by 3 % compared to the dual loop setup when the air conditioner was operating and by 7 % compared to the standard <b>vehicle</b> <b>thermal</b> management setup. The simulations revealed that this was due to an improvement in the underhood cooling airflow rates and an increase in the initial temperature difference between the coolant and air entering the radiator...|$|R
40|$|Collecting large {{scientific}} quality {{thermal infrared}} image and video data sets {{is an expensive}} time consuming endeavor. Thermal infrared imagers cost much more than comparable visible systems and require skilled experienced operators. Also, time and experienced personnel are required to collect quality ground truth. Often it is advantageous to perform computer simulations {{as an alternative to}} collecting image and video data with real camera systems. As long as enough physics is incorporated into the models to give accurately comparable results to real imagery, simulated data can be used interchangeably. Generating synthetic images and video has the added benefit of being flexible as the user has control over every aspect of the simulation. Simulations are not subject to restrictions such as location, weather conditions, time of day, or time of year. Ground truth is assigned instead of measured in the synthetic world so it is known a priori. This thesis illustrates a method of using the Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) software to create simulated infrared images and video of validated <b>thermal</b> target <b>vehicle</b> models inside <b>thermal</b> infrared wide-area scenes. A finite difference heat propagation and surface temperature solver, ThermoAnalytics Multi-Service Electro-optic Signature (MuSES TM), was used to accurately model the emissive <b>thermal</b> target <b>vehicles.</b> Validation of the <b>thermal</b> target <b>vehicle</b> model was performed using images taken from a laboratory calibrated MWIR camera. Images taken with the calibrated camera of the same type of vehicle as the target model were compared to the synthetic images for the same conditions for validation. Target vehicle motion was added to the simulations through the use of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), DIRSIGs movement files, and custom python scripting. The output images from DIRSIG were then laced together into video. The resulting video was used to test three tracking algorithms illuminating each one’s strengths and weaknesses...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} element {{to the success}} of new propulsion technologies that enable reductions in fuel use is the integration of component thermal management technologies within a viable vehicle package. Vehicle operation requires <b>vehicle</b> <b>thermal</b> management systems capable of balancing the needs of multiple vehicle systems that may require heat for operation, require cooling to reject heat, or require operation within specified temperature ranges. As vehicle propulsion transitions away from a single form of vehicle propulsion based solely on conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs) toward a wider array of choices including more electrically dominant systems such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), new challenges arise associated with <b>vehicle</b> <b>thermal</b> management. As the number of components that require active thermal management increase, so do the costs in terms of dollars, weight, and size. Integrated <b>vehicle</b> <b>thermal</b> management is one pathway to address the cost, weight, and size challenges. The integration of the power electronics and electric machine (PEEM) thermal management with other existing vehicle systems is one path for reducing the cost of electric drive systems. This work demonstrates techniques for evaluating and quantifying the integrated transient and continuous heat loads of combined systems incorporating electric drive systems that operate primarily under transient duty cycles, but the approach can be extended to include additional steady-state duty cycles typical for designing <b>vehicle</b> <b>thermal</b> management systems of conventional vehicles. The work compares opportunities to create an integrated low temperature coolant loop combining the power electronics and electric machine with the air conditioning system in contrast to a high temperature system integrated with the ICE cooling system...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{classification}} of vehicles into sub-category types poses a significant challenge within infra-red imagery due to {{the high levels of}} intra-class variation in <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicle</b> signatures caused by aspects of design, current operating duration and ambient thermal conditions. Despite these challenges, infra-red sensing offers significant generalized target object detection advantages in terms of all-weather operation and invariance to visual camouflage techniques. This work investigates the accuracy of a number of real-time object classification approaches for this task within the wider context of an existing initial object detection and tracking framework. Specifically we evaluate the use of traditional feature-driven bag of visual words and histogram of oriented gradient classification approaches against modern convolutional neural network architectures. Furthermore, we use classical photogrammetry, within the context of current target detection and classification techniques, as a means of approximating 3 D target position within the scene based on this vehicle type classification. Based on photogrammetric estimation of target position, we then illustrate the use of regular Kalman filter based tracking operating on actual 3 D vehicle trajectories. Results are presented using a conventional thermal-band infra-red (IR) sensor arrangement where targets are tracked over a range of evaluation scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and design of}} a cryogenic liquid quantity gauge for zero-g applications is described. The gauge, named the Compression Mass Gauge (CMG), operates {{on the principle of}} slightly changing the volume of the tank by an oscillating bellows. The resulting pressure change is measured and used to predict the volume of vapor in the tank, from which the volume of liquid is computed. For each gauging instance, pressures are measured for several different bellows frequencies to enable minor real-gas effects to be quantified and thereby to obtain a gauging accuracy of +/- 1 % of tank volume. Southwest Research Institute (Tm) and NASA-GRC (Glenn Research Center) have developed several previous breadboard and engineering development gauges and tested them in cryogenic hydrogen and nitrogen to establish the gauge capabilities, to resolve several design issues, and to formulate data processing algorithms. The CMG has been selected by NASA's Future X program for a flight demonstration on the USAF (United States Air Force) / Boeing Solar <b>Thermal</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Space Experiment (SOTVSE). This paper reviews the design trade studies needed to satisfy the SOTVSE limitations on CMG power, volume, and mass, and describes the mechanical design of the CMG...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} work aims {{to study the}} impact of the heating system on the fuel consumption of a hybrid electric <b>vehicle</b> (HEV). The <b>thermal</b> engine is less used in an HEV than in a <b>thermal</b> <b>vehicle,</b> thus the cabin heating is partly ensured by electrical resistances. However, because the battery is partly charged by the thermal engine, this electrical heating has an impact on the fuel consumption. In the present work, a multi-domain model is proposed to analyze {{the impact of the}} heating system on the fuel consumption of a HEV. The models of the different physical subsystems are organized and unified by energetic macroscopic representation (EMR). Experimental validations, with an accuracy of 95 %, are provided for each subsystem model. The validated simulation models are used to study the impact of the heating system for a specific driving cycle and climatic condition. For a simple energy management strategy (EMS), there is an over-consumption of 19 % that is due to the heating system. When a more efficient EMS is used, the over-consumption is reduced to 12 %. This study shows the interest in developing advanced energy management strategies that couple the traction and the heating functions of the vehicle...|$|R
