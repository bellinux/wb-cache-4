30|$|The {{height and}} {{area of the}} second peak {{increase}} with increasing of amount of deposited tin. At this peak, tin is dissolved {{in the form of}} tin pyrophosphate complexes, in which it is in the oxidation level of + 2. After tin deposition at the limiting current (cathodic border of the range of potential scan is − 1.2 V), the shoulder appears on the downward branch of the peak. It is associated apparently with the formation of Sn(II) compounds passivating the surface. At the more positive potentials, the third peak appears on the anodic branch of the CVA curve. According to E-pH diagram at 6.5, only Sn(IV) compounds are produced at the potential range of the third peak [28]. At this peak, the cathodic deposit consisting of <b>tin</b> and its <b>hydroxide</b> oxidizes with formation of Sn(IV) compounds. Both soluble tin pyrophosphate complexes (with tin oxidation level of + 4) and insoluble compounds including tin dioxide can be produced depending on the composition and pH of the electrolyte.|$|R

It is found that the {{corrosion resistance}} of this alloy improves {{with the increase of}} the applied cooling rate, which is attributed to the distinct microstructure. The furnace-cooled and air-cooled alloy with active Zn-rich phase and a microstructure formed by a coarser dendritic array associated with larger size of AgZn 3 intermetallic compounds exhibit a worse corrosion resistance due to a serious galvanic corrosion. Besides, the Mott-Schottky measurement and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed to analyze the semiconductor properties and composition of the passive film formed {{on the surface of the}} alloy. It confirms that the stability and protective ability of the passive films formed on furnace-cooled and air-cooled alloy are worse than that of water-cooled alloy due to their higher oxygen vacancy defects and concentration of unstable SnO.

The bulk polymerization was conducted at 110 and 130 °C with different Sn(Oct) 2 /BF 3 ratios. The polymerization kinetics was followed using gel permeation chromatography, and the molecular structures of the low-molecular weight polymers were examined using 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A polymerization induction period was observed in polymerizations containing the Sn(Oct) 2 catalyst, {{but it was not}} observed in the system containing only BF 3. After the induction period, BF 3 and Sn(Oct) 2 initiated the polymerization separately.

40|$|Particle {{contamination}} {{control is a}} critical issue for the semiconductor industry. In the near future, this industry will be concerned with the chemical identities of contaminant particles as small as 0. 01 pm in size. Therefore, analytical techniques with both high chemical sensitivity and spatial resolution are required. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides excellent spatial resolution and yields structural and compositional information. It is rarely used, however, due {{to the difficulty of}} sample preparation. The goals of this research are to promote the use of TEM as an ultrafine particle analysis tool by developing new sample preparation methods, and to exploit the new TEM techniques for analysis of particles in semiconductor processing fluids. A TEM methodology for the analysis of particulate contaminants in fluids with an elemental detectability limit as low as 0. 1 part per trillion (ppt), and a particle concentration detectability limit as low as 1 particle/ml for particles greater than 0. 2 pm was developed and successfully applied to the analysis of particles in HF, H 202, de-ionized (DI) water, and on the surface of an electronic device. HF samples from three manufacturers were examined. For HF (B), the maximum particle concentration was 8. 3 x 103 particles/ml. Both a viscous material and lath-shaped particles were observed.

40|$|The {{prominent}} {{melting point}} depression of nanoparticles {{has been the}} subject of a considerable amount of research. For their promising applications in electronics, tin-based nano-alloys such as near-eutectic Sn–Ag–Cu (SAC) alloys have been synthesized via various techniques. However, due to issues such as particle aggregation and oxidation or introduced impurities, the application of these nano-size particles has been confined or aborted. For instance, thermal investigations by DTA/DSC in a large number of studies revealed exothermic peaks in the range of 240 – 500 °C, i. e. above the melting point of SAC nanoparticles, with different and quite controversial explanations for this unclear phenomenon. This represents a considerable drawback for the application of nanoparticles. Correspondingly, in the current study, the thermal stability of SAC nanoparticles has been investigated via electron microscopy, XRD, FTIR, and DSC/TG analysis. It was found that the nanoparticles consist mainly of a metallic β-Sn core and an amorphous <b>tin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> shell structure. The SnO crystalline phase formation from this amorphous shell has been associated with the exothermic peaks on the first heating cycle of the nanoparticles, followed by a disproportionation reaction into metallic Sn and SnO 2.

The use of nano-ITOH nanoparticles enables a facile large-scale fabrication of homogeneous crack-free coatings with good adhesion to the substrate, good optical quality and tunable thickness, which easily transform at 400 degrees C into crystalline ITO with similar morphology. Macroporous ITO films exhibit reasonably high electric conductivity of 4. 0 +/- 0. 3 S cm(- 1) and open interconnected pores with a uniform size of ca. 300 nm, which makes them suitable conducting platforms for immobilization of bulky redox species or for deposition of functional electroactive layers. Deposition of functional semiconducting layers {{on the walls of}} the porous ITO scaffold was shown for titanium dioxide, which penetrates the ITO framework as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of a cross-section. The obtained layers were used as conducting substrates for the immobilization of the heme proteins cytochrome c and hemoglobin, which demonstrate a direct electron transfer to the macroporous ITO electrode. Surface coverage of cytochrome c adsorbed on the macroporous ITO electrode is more than 12 times higher than on a planar one, reaching 400 pmol cm(- 2) for a film of ca. 360 nm in thickness. Hemoglobin adsorbed on the macroporous ITO electrodes also demonstrates a noticeably high surface coverage of ca. 160 +/- 20 pmol cm(- 2), which is roughly 7 - 10 times higher than the theoretical value for monolayer coverage.

30|$|There {{are also}} several reports {{dealing with the}} {{synthesis}} of bimetallic Ni-Sn nanoparticles via the chemical reduction method. Unfortunately, some of these papers did not provide any structural analysis, and others presented controversial results. For instance, Milanova et al. [6] synthesized Ni-Sn nanoparticles at a mass ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 2 : 3 (molar ratio approx. 4 : 3) with a C-foam support using sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) in an aqueous solution at room temperature. However, it is practically impossible to estimate the average size of the obtained nanoparticles from the presented SEM images, and no diffraction pattern of the Ni-Sn nanoparticles was shown. In a later paper of this group, the same method was used to synthesize Ni-Sn nanoparticles at mass ratios of Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 3 : 1 and 3 : 2 (molar ratios approx. 6 : 1 and 3 : 1) with and without different supports [7]. The obtained nanopowder was additionally dried in vacuum for 24  h at 373  K which had not been mentioned in Ref. [6]. Furthermore, there is some contradiction between the results shown in Fig.  4 of Ref. [7] and the corresponding text: whereas in the text it is mentioned that the compound Ni 3 Sn is formed in nanopowders with a molar ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 6 : 1 and the compound Ni 3 Sn 2 in those with a molar ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 3 : 1, the figure seems to indicate the opposite. In contrast, Ni-Sn nanoparticles with molar ratios Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 2 : 3, and 1 : 2 using NaBH 4 as a reducing agent were also synthesized by Liu et al. [8]. The main difference in synthesis compared to the procedure in Refs. [6, 7] was the addition of trisodium citrate (Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7) to the mixture of metal ions {{and the addition of}} ammonia to adjust the pH value. The samples were dried in vacuum at 343  K. From the XRD patterns, it was concluded that nanopowders with molar ratios Sn:Ni[*]=[*] 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 consisted mainly of Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and pure Sn while nanopowders with molar ratios Sn:Ni[*]=[*] 2 : 3 and 1 : 2 contained the compounds “NiSn” (a compound which does not exist in the phase diagram [9]) and Ni 3 Sn as well as pure Sn. According to the presented SEM images, the size of as-synthesized nanoparticles was between 50 and 100  nm. Pure Ni and Sn nanoparticles as well as bimetallic Ni-Sn nanoparticles with initial weight ratios Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 9 : 1; 3 : 1; 1 : 1, and 1 : 3 (molar ratios 19 : 1; 6 : 1; 2 : 1, and 2 : 3, respectively) were produced from aqueous solutions using nickel sulfate and tin sulfate as metal precursors and PVP and NaBH 4 as a capping and reducing agent, respectively, by Dhanapal et al. [10]. According to the provided FESEM analysis, the Ni nanoparticles had a sheet or foam like morphology while the XRD pattern showed a broad diffraction line with three small sub-peaks of lower intensity. In contrast, Sn nanopowder consisted of spherical and mostly agglomerated fine particles, and the XRD pattern showed sharp diffraction lines corresponding to the crystal structure. The surface morphology of bimetallic Ni-Sn nanoparticles changed from a foam-like type for nanopowder with the molar ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 19 : 1 to an ultrafine spherical-like type for nanopowder with the molar ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 2 : 3. Based on the XRD patterns, it was suggested that Ni-Sn nanoparticles contained nickel hydroxide and <b>tin</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The prepared nanopowders, except nano Sn, were annealed afterwards for 3  h at 773  K under N 2 atmosphere. The XRD analysis of the annealed samples showed that amorphous Ni nanoparticles had transformed into nanocrystalline Ni. The diffraction peaks of nanoparticles with a Ni:Sn molar ratio of 19 : 1 corresponded also to the Ni fcc structure. XRD patterns of annealed Ni-Sn nanoparticles with initial molar ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 6 : 1 revealed the formation of the Ni 3 Sn phase besides pure Ni. Annealed nanoparticles with Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 2 : 1 contained Ni and Ni-Sn phases; while only the Sn phase could be distinguished from the XRD pattern of Ni-Sn nanoparticles with an initial molar ratio Ni:Sn[*]=[*] 2 : 3.|$|E
