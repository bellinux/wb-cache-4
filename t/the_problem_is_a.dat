5|$|The next case {{given to}} Sam and Max {{involves}} {{dealing with a}} computer crisis that is causing the world economy to collapse. They discover <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> virtual reality program called Reality 2.0, powered by the Internet (which has gained sentience), which is hypnotizing people so they never {{want to leave the}} program. Sam and Max access the program themselves and introduce a computer virus that crashes Reality 2.0 and deletes the digital embodiment of the Internet. Prior to expiring, the Internet reveals that it was following the plans of one Roy G. Biv. Sam eventually deduces that Roy G. Biv is actually Hugh Bliss, a character seemingly in the background of all their previous cases. The Freelance Police travel to Bliss' Prismatology retreat on the Moon, where Bliss is preparing a device to hypnotize the entire planet. Bliss reveals himself as a colony of sentient bacteria that feeds off of the endorphins produced by human happiness; by hypnotizing the planet, Bliss assures himself of a permanent supply of nourishment. Bliss activates the device, but is killed when Sam tricks him into a tank of water and boils it using the rocket engine of a lunar lander. Returning to Earth, Max takes great pleasure in reversing the hypnotism by personally knocking everyone on the planet unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Design {{theory is}} a study of {{combinatorial}} designs, which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties. Block designs are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area {{is one of the}} oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in Kirkman's schoolgirl problem proposed in 1850. The solution of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> special case of a Steiner system, which systems play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups. The area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics.|$|E
25|$|In modern terms, {{the problem}} is an inverse problem, an attempt to deduce the {{parameters}} of a mathematical model from observed data. Though <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> simple one for modern mathematics after the advent of electronic computers, {{at the time it}} involved much laborious hand calculation. Adams began by assuming a nominal position for the hypothesised body, using the empirical Bode's law. He then calculated the path of Uranus using the assumed position of the perturbing body and calculated the difference between his calculated path and the observations, in modern terms the residuals. He then adjusted the characteristics of the perturbing body in a way suggested by the residuals and repeated the process, a process similar to regression analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E
25|$|Proposed {{solutions}} to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> topic of heated debate among {{politicians and the}} community at large.

40|$|This {{memorandum}} {{contains the}} detailed solution to four classroom problems of Elementary Computer Science. They are adequate for second semester students. <b>The</b> first <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> simple stocks control application. It {{involves the use}} of sequential text files. And the design calls also for the use of several data structures: Tables and lists. <b>The</b> second <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very simplified version of printed circuit design. It involves some geometric calculations: straight segment intersections. <b>The</b> third <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pattern recognition <b>problem.</b> It deals with the detection of given patterns inside a bitmap table, which presumably has been obtained through digitization of <b>a</b> picture. <b>The</b> fourth <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> path planning <b>problem.</b> It takes some of the ideas of <b>the</b> travelling salesman <b>problem,</b> but <b>the</b> specification <b>is</b> much more relaxed and, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> and its resolution are easier and shorter. <b>The</b> last three <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> strongly related to Computer Graphics.

South America is, as you may have heard, a granite continent. At this single point in the {{interior}} there has been, in some far distant age, a great, sudden volcanic upheaval. These cliffs, I may remark, are basaltic, and therefore plutonic. An area, as large perhaps as Sussex, has been lifted up en bloc with all its living contents, and cut off by perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from {{all the rest of the}} continent. What is the result? Why, the ordinary laws of Nature are suspended. The various checks which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered. Creatures survive which would otherwise disappear. You will observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are Jurassic, and therefore of a great age in the order of life. They have been artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions." ...|$|E
