Growth and yield of all amaranth lines were higher in gray soil (pH 8. 4) than in dark red soil (pH 6. 6) and red soil (pH 5. 4). The combined NPK fertilizer resulted in highest growth parameters and yield of amaranths in all soils. Nitrogen fertilizer alone did not affect growth parameters and yield of amaranths in dark red and red soils. Growth parameters and yield increased similarly with the 30, 40, and 50  g m− 2 of NPK fertilizer in BB line, and with the 20, 30, 40, and 50  g m− 2 in BC line. Agronomic efficiency of NPK fertilizer at 50  g m− 2 was not prominent on the amaranths, compared to the fertilizer at 40  g m− 2. Amaranth lines had higher Na in dark red and red soils, while K and Mg in gray soil, Ca in gray and red soils, and Fe in dark red soil. The NPK fertilizer resulted in higher Na, Ca, Mg, and P in BB line in glasshouse. These minerals in BB line were not clearly affected, but in BC line were lower with NPK fertilizer at 20 – 50  g m− 2 in field. These studies indicate that gray soil is best for amaranth cultivation and combined NPK fertilizer at 20 – 40  g m− 2 is effective in gray soil in Okinawa for higher yield and minerals of amaranth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} non-cooperative fishing between Mainland China (MC) and <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW)</b> {{as well as the}} effects of rising sea surface temperature (SST) on the grey mullet fishery. The results show that Taiwan can expand its fleets to a greater extent when facing an imperfectly elastic demand for fish than when facing a perfectly elastic demand. In addition, when consumer welfare is included in the determination of the size of fleets, fleet size can expand more than when profit is considered alone. It is also shown that the expansion of the fleets in MC and the rising SST cause the rent obtained from the TW fishery to decline, and that Taiwan may partially offset such an adverse effect by adjusting the fleet size.

In this study, we compared {{the quantity and quality of}} nephrological and urological articles published in international journals from the three major regions of China: the mainland (ML), Hong Kong (HK), and <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW).</b> METHODS: Nephrological and urological articles originating from ML, TW, and HK that were published in 61 journals from 1999 - 2008 were retrieved from the PubMed database. We recorded the numbers of total articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, case reports, impact factors (IF), citations, and articles published in the leading general-medicine journals. We used these data to compare the quantity and quality of publication output from the three regions. RESULTS: The total number of articles increased significantly from 1999 to 2008 in the three regions. The number of articles from ML has exceeded that from HK since 2004, and surpassed that from TW in 2008. Publications from TW had the highest accumulated IF, total citations of articles, and the most articles published in leading general-medicine journals. However, HK publications had the highest average IF. Although ML produced the largest quantity of articles, it exhibited the lowest quality among the three regions. CONCLUSION: The number of nephrological and urological publications originating from the three major regions of China increased significantly from 1999 to 2008.

Objectives: To understand media professionals’ experiences with applying controversial practices when reporting suicide news in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 33 journalists working at popular and representative media outlets in Mainland China (CN), Hong Kong (HK), and <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW)</b> were conducted. Grounded theory method was used for data analysis. Results: Controversial practices were commonly and consciously adopted by journalists in the three regions when reporting suicide news. To gather suicide news tips, the journalists in the three regions commonly wrote their suicide news articles {{based on what they}} overheard. Some journalists would fake their identities to gather information and some even stole photos or documents. Many CN journalists and some HK and TW ones secretly paid money to key informants. Some TW journalists obtained information leaked from their police contacts. At a suicide scene, HK and TW journalists often neglected surviving family members’ requests to stop taking photos and continued to do so. Conclusion: Journalists’ controversial practices violate suicidal individuals and their families’ privacy. More studies are needed to investigate how suicide survivors perceive and are influenced by these practices.

The molecular epidemiology of G 9 rotaviruses in Taiwan from 2000 to 2002 was investigated in this study. G 9 rotavirus first appeared in 2000 with 4 cases and constituted 33. 8 % and 54. 8 % of the rotavirus-positive samples in 2001 and 2002, respectively. These G 9 strains belonged to P[8]G 9, subgroup II, and long electropherotype, except one belonged to P[4]G 9, subgroup II, and short electrophero-type. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 52 Taiwanese G 9 rotaviruses showed that the VP 7 genes shared {{a high degree of}} identity to overseas G 9 rotaviruses detected after 1993 and that the VP 8 * portions of the VP 4 genes were more closely related to those of local rotaviruses of other G types. The two P[8]G 9 strains with high nucleotide identities in the VP 7 and the partial VP 4 genes, 01 <b>TW</b> 591 of <b>Taiwan</b> from 2001 and 95 H 115 of Japan from 1995, varied in four genes, genes 2, 3, 7, and 8, which was revealed by RNA-RNA hybridization.

The "Foxconn suicides" is a description referring to a string of suicides/attempts during 2010, {{all of which were}} related to a giant electrical manufacturing company, Foxconn. This study aimed to examine the clustering and copycat effects of the Foxconn suicides, and to investigate temporal patterns in how they were reported by the media in Mainland China, Hong Kong (HK), and <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW).</b> Methods Relevant articles were collected from representative newspapers published in three big cities in Mainland China (Beijing (BJ), Shenzhen (SZ), and Guangzhou (GZ)), HK, and TW, together with searching intensity data on the topic conducted using the Baidu search engine in Mainland China. The temporal clustering effects of the Foxconn suicides and their media prominence were assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The media reports of the Foxconn suicides' temporal patterns were explored using a nonparametric curve estimation method (that is, the local linear method). The potential mutual interactions between the Foxconn suicides and their media prominence were also examined, using logistic and Poisson regression methods. Results The results support a temporal clustering effect for the Foxconn suicides. The BJ-based newspapers' reporting and the occurrence of a Foxconn suicide/attempt are each found to be associated with an elevated chance of a further Foxconn suicide 3 days later. The occurrence of a Foxconn suicide also immediately influenced the intensity of both Baidu searching and newspaper reporting. Regional diversity in suicide reporting tempo-patterns within Mainland China, and similarities between HK and TW, are also demonstrated. Conclusions The Foxconn suicides were temporally clustered. Their occurrences were influenced by the {{reporting of}} BJ-based newspapers, and contagion within the company itself.

The TW clade is endemic to Taiwan, while the Christmas Island (CI) clade is confined to CI. There was weak or no population subdivision observed within these clades, suggesting high gene flow within the range of the clades. The clades demonstrate clear signatures of recent demographic expansion that predated the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but they have maintained a relatively stable effective population in the past 100, 000 years. The persistence of intertidal fauna through the LGM may, therefore, be a common biogeographic pattern. The lack of genetic subdivision in the IM clade across the Indian and Pacific Oceans may be attributed to recent expansion of ranges and the fact that a mutation-drift equilibrium has not been reached, or the relaxed habitat requirements of C. malayensis that facilitates high concurrent gene flow. Further studies are needed to determine between these alternative hypotheses. © The Author 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the orthopaedic research output in the three Chinese-speaking regions – the Mainland (ML), Hong Kong (HK), and <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW).</b> HypothesisWe hypothesized that there was a positive trend in China orthopaedic research during the past decade and this regardless of the Chinese-speaking regions of origin. Materials and methodsForty-nine orthopaedic journals were retrieved from the PubMed database and Science Citation Index Expanded. Articles from ML, TW, and HK in 2000 to 2009 were identified. The total number of articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), impact factors (IF), citations, and articles published in the top 10 orthopaedic journals were analyzed. ResultsA total of 1878 published articles in 2000 to 2009 were broken down as follows: ML (607), TW (865), and HK (406). There was a significant increase in published articles for ML and TW from 2000 to 2009. The number of published articles from ML exceeded the total sum of articles from TW and HK in 2009. The accumulated IF of articles from TW (1751. 91) was higher than that from ML (1054. 67) and HK (708. 25). TW had the highest average IF (2. 025), followed by ML (1. 902) and HK (1. 862). The total citations of published articles in 2000 to 2009 from TW (4759) were higher than those for HK (2276) and ML (1751). The highest average citation of each article was from HK (5. 784), followed by TW (5. 720) and ML (3. 051). TW published 339 articles in 10 high-impact journals, whereas ML and HK published 267 and 154 articles, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the current pharmacological treatments patterns among a cohort of children diagnosed with ASD in <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW)</b> and Hong Kong (HK). METHODS: Patients who aged younger than 12 years old with autism diagnosis (ICD- 9 -CM 299. xx) were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and registry for catastrophic illness between 2000 to 2010 in TW and the Clinical Data and Reporting System (CDARS) database between 2001 and 2010 in HK. Based on literature review, agents found to be possibly efficacious of those patients were studied. Psychotropic drug use was assessed within one year after the first diagnosis of ASD was recorded. Results: A total of 11, 825 (5, 501 from TW; 6, 324 from HK) of ASD children were identified. The majority of patients were boys (84. 0 % for TW; 87. 2 % for HK), and median age at diagnosis were 5 years old in both areas. 2, 354 patients (1, 740 (31. 6 %) from TW, 614 (9. 7 %) from HK) received at least one prescription of psychotropic drug within the study period. There is variation of prescribing pattern in TW and HK. In TW, the most commonly prescribed medications were stimulants (1, 018 patients, 58. 5 %), antipsychotics (615 patients, 35. 3 %), anxiolytics (477 patients, 27. 4 %), antidepressant (227 patients, 13. 0 %), and clonidine (128 patients, 7. 4 %). In HK, stimulants was also the most commonly prescribed medication (506 patients, 82. 4 %), followed by antipsychotics (133 patients, 21. 7 %), anxiolytics (78 patients, 12. 7 %), and antidepressant (31 patients, 5. 0 %). Of these stimulants, methylphenidate was the most commonly prescribed drug in both TW and HK (70. 1 % in TW, 92. 1 % in HK). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed one-third of ASD children received medication treatment in TW whereas it was only one-tenth of children received treatment in HK.

However, little is known about trends in the incidence and resource utilization of these conditions in Asia as life-style have westernized. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence (IR) and medical resource utilization of cardiovascular events among the study population in Hong Kong (HK), <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW),</b> Japan (JP) and US from 2006 - 2013. METHODS: We utilized the OMOP common data model in the AsPEN converted from a 1 % random sample of Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a 5 % random sample from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Japan Medical Data Center Database (JMDC), and 5 % sample from the US Medicare database. Hospitalization and length of hospital stay for myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were identified from the databases. Comorbidities and concurrent medications for the patients {{at the time of the}} MI/ACS were assessed. RESULTS: The age-gender adjusted IR (per 100 persons) for MI/ACS were 0. 2 in HK, 0. 1 in JP and TW, and 0. 9 in US. Average number of hospitalizations increased from 4. 7 - 15. 2 in HK, 0. 8 - 1. 1 in JP, 4. 5 - 7. 0 in US but slightly decreased in TW (10. 8 - 10. 0) over the study period. Average length of stay was increased by 14. 5 %- 107. 9 % across the four countries. Congestive heart failure and hypertension were the most common comorbidities in these patients. Medications used after MI/ACS were quite different across sites: 93 % of HK and 63 % of TW patients started antiplatelet after MI/ACS vs. only 14 % patients in JP and 0. 1 % in US. 61 % patients in HK started renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors after diagnosis, whereas 22. 1 % and 38. 3 % patients in TW and US started the same treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The IR of MI/ACS were similar among different Asian sites but were higher in US. An increasing number of hospitalizations and length of stay suggested an increasing disease burden. Discrepancy in recommended drug use after MI/ACS provides additional insights into the variation across countries in treatment patterns that must be appreciated when undertaking multinational studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of clinically recognized disease among the study population in Hong Kong (HK), <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW),</b> Japan (JP) and the United States (US). METHODS: We utilized the OMOP common data model in the AsPEN converted from a 1 % random sample of Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a 5 % random sample from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Japan Medical Data Center Database (JMDC), and 5 % sample from the US Medicare database. Prevalence rates (per 100 persons, age-gender adjusted) of 33 clinically recognized diseases were evaluated. RESULTS: 6, 476, 773 individuals were identified in 4 databases, 47 % were male. Hypertension is the most common disease in HK, TW and US and ranked fourth in JP with the prevalence of 2. 6, 7. 9, 59. 6 and 4. 6 respectively. Diabetes ranked third in HK (1. 3), fourth in TW (3. 8), fifth in JP (3. 7) and third in US (23. 3). Hyperlipidemia is the second most common in TW (5. 1), JP (4. 9) and US (51. 6) and seventh in HK (0. 8). Obstructive chronic bronchitis is the third most common disease in TW and JP (4. 6 for TW, 4. 8 for JP, 0. 7 for HK, 9. 1 for US). Asthma is the most common disease in JP (7. 6) but not in other sites (0. 5 for HK, 2. 3 for TW, 5 for US). Prevalence of cancers were similar among Asian sites ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 5 but were lower than US (0. 4 - 2. 2). Similar pattern was observed in psychiatric disorders; Prevalence of depression and schizophrenia were 0. 4 - 1. 6 and 0. 4 in Asian sites whereas 4. 4 and 1 in US. US has the highest prevalence in most of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS: US has the highest age-gender adjusted prevalence across most of the diseases but the discrepancy was much less in non-CV diseases. This may be due to the difference in diet and lifestyle as well as in health care system and coding between Asian countries and US. Understanding the underlying prevalence of disease across standardized database representations is important when undertaking multi-national studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Methods. Patients aged 55 years and older, referred for upper endoscopy due to dyspeptic symptoms, were included in the study. Gastric biopsies were histological investigated according modified Sydney classification. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was detected if any two of three methods (urease test, histology, and serology) were positive. Results. Overall 322 patients included: 52 from <b>Taiwan</b> (<b>TW),</b> 171 from Latvia (LV) and 99 from Lithuania (LT). There were 227 (70 %) females and 95 (30 %) males. The mean age of TW patients was significantly lower (61. 0 ± 5. 8 years), than of LV (68. 1 ± 7. 3 years) and LT (66. 5 ± 7. 5 years) patients. H. pylori was established in 224 (69. 6 %) patients. H. pylori positivity was established in 43 (82. 7 %) TW patients, in 112 (65. 5 %) LV patients, and in 69 (69. 7 %) LT patients (P> 0. 05). In H. pylori-infected patients, any atrophy either in the corpus or in the antrum of the stomach was detected in 26 (60. 5 %) TW patients, in 40 (35. 7 %) LV patients, and in 36 (52. 2 %) LT patients (between TW and LV patients P 0. 05). Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 22 (51. 2 %) TW patients, in 37 (33. 0 %) LV patients and in 31 (44. 9 %) LT patients among countries (P> 0. 05). There were no significant differences in proportions of different degrees of both atrophy and intestinal metaplasia among countries. Intestinal metaplasia was found in 79 (77. 5 %) of 102 patients with any degree of atrophy and in 11 (9. 0 %) of 122 patients without atrophy (P 0, 05.
