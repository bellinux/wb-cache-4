5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> or pharynx (throat).|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> and infect enterocytes of the villi {{of the small}} intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium.

5|$|The {{mouth is}} inside {{the base of the}} crown of tentacles but to one side. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> runs from the mouth {{to one side of the}} stomach, in the bottom of the ampulla. The {{intestine}} runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> and intestine are both supported by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected to the body wall, and another mesentery connects <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> to the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E
5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in <b>the</b> <b>gut.</b> While it reduces LDL cholesterol, {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness.

5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{data were}} {{published}} as {{a letter in}} The Lancet in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen.

5|$|The {{mouth is}} ventral {{and a little}} behind {{the front of the}} body. The foregut, stomach and {{intestine}} run a little below the midline of the body and the anus is {{at the tip of the}} tail. Above <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and separated from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but still under the front of the body. In the other class, Enopla, the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice. The rhynchocoel is a coelom, as it is lined by epithelium.|$|E

5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The diet of Engraulicypris sardella (Cyprinidae) larvae was {{determined}} {{from the open}} waters of Lake Malawi, Africa. <b>The</b> <b>guts</b> of first-feeding larvae of 2 - 3 mm total length (TL) usually contained many cells of 5 - 9 um diameter tentatively identified as a non-colonial green alga (Chloro-phyta). The number of these cells in <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of larvae declined as larvae increased in size, and were not found in larvae greater than 9 mm TL. Other types of phytoplankton were rarely seen in <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of larvae. Copepod nauplii were eaten by larvae greater than 4 mm TL, and copepodite copepods and cladoceans by larvae greater than 5 mm TL. The biomass of open water crustacean zooplankton and E. sardella larvae were determined over a 2 -year sampling programme. The mortality rate of E. sardella was negatively correlated with zooplankton biomass, but was not significantly correlated {{with the amount of}} zooplankton food in <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of larvae...|$|R

5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
