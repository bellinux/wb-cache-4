5|$|In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) {{announced}} a proposal, which {{became known as}} the Northern Heights project, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to the Northern City line at Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> services from the Northern line's existing terminus at Archway station (then also called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.|$|E

The {{makers of the}} children's film The Boy Who Turned Yellow (1972) managed to persuade London Underground to paint a <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> yellow.|$|E
25|$|London's {{underground}} railway system, {{known as}} the Tube, has featured in several films. The plot of the 1998 film Sliding Doors hinges on whether Gwyneth Paltrow's character catches a particular <b>Tube</b> <b>train</b> or not. Bulldog Jack (1934), Man Hunt (1941), The Good Die Young (1954), and 28 Weeks Later (2007) all include chase sequences across underground tracks.|$|E

25|$|On 22 July 2005 Jean Charles de Menezes {{was shot}} dead by armed police {{officers}} on a London Underground train at Stockwell tube station. Three media reports carry unconfirmed assertions by unattributed UK government sources that SRR personnel {{were involved in the}} intelligence collection effort leading to the shooting and on the <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> whilst the offensive action occurred. A partial Ministry of Defence response was reported by The Sunday Times.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} risk for passengers of trains operating in evacuated tubes {{is that they}} could be exposed to the risk of cabin depressurization unless tunnel safety monitoring systems can repressurize the tube {{in the event of a}} train malfunction or accident though since trains are likely to operate at or near the Earth's surface, emergency restoration of ambient pressure should be straightforward. The RAND Corporation has depicted a vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> that could, in theory, cross the Atlantic or the USA in ~21 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The smaller {{diameter}} of the <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> {{in relation to the}} tunnel allowed the first car to ride up over the hydraulic buffers, with the second coach driving under the first, leading to significant damage at this end. The leading driving car buckled at three points into a V shape and was crushed to less than half its length between the wall and the weight of the train piling up behind it. The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the leading end as it rode over the second car. Forty-two passengers and the driver died and 74 passengers were treated in hospital for their injuries.|$|E

One of the trust's boxes stands outside the Kent Police Museum in Chatham, Kent. and another at Grampian Transport Museum.

25|$|Aldwych tube station, {{formerly}} on {{a branch}} of the Piccadilly line, has been used as the location for many films and television productions, especially since the branch and station closed in 1994 and the platforms have been left intact making it suitable for filming and photography purposes, due to the absence of a regular train service. A 1970s <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> permanently is based at the station and heritage rolling stock can be brought in for filming - London Underground have retained one of their 1938 trains which can be used for historic appearances. In more recent years filming has also taken place at the former Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross station, which were withdrawn from regular use when the line was extended in 1999 avoiding the station.|$|E
25|$|The Moorgate tube crash {{occurred}} on 28 February 1975 on the isolated Northern City Line when a southbound train failed {{to stop at}} the Moorgate terminus and crashed into the wall at end of the tunnel, killing forty-four people. No fault was found with the train equipment, the subsequent report found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the cause. Following the incident, a system that stops a train automatically if the driver fails to brake was introduced at dead-ends on the London Underground. The Northern City Line was connected to British Rail tracks at Finsbury Park in the 1970s. The last <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> ran in October 1975, and British Rail services began in 1976. In 1977, the Piccadilly line was extended from Hounslow to Heathrow Airport, and in 1986 a platform serving Terminal 4 opened on a loop line.|$|E

A sparrow-hawk nests {{in a silver}} birch, a jay comes visiting, bees and wood-mice also live here." [...] The TES continues: [...] "There are open glades for picnics and, in autumn, blackberries to gather. The aim here is to manage the woodland as a natural piece of countryside in town, and if, from time to time, you glimpse a <b>tube</b> <b>train,</b> you hardly notice it, beyond the trees." ...|$|E

Inside the packaging, there is an oil-on-canvas of the band dressed as mop-top skinheads in a <b>tube</b> <b>train.</b> The album's lyric sheets also feature the songs' chord progressions, hand-written by guitar player Graham Coxon. While Albarn explained that it was an attempt to [...] " [...] people to know that, old-fashioned as it might seem, we write songs", Total Guitar magazine attributed the inclusion of the chords to Coxon's [...] "keen to demystify guitar playing".|$|E

He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a <b>tube</b> <b>train</b> in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Without the tireless work of Maclean's daughter, Nan Milton, {{the memory}} of her father might have been lost. It was not just that she helped found the John MacLean Society and served as it's Secretary, she made the revival possible. At a time when no one was interested, she copied out all her father's {{writings}} from his own and other publications in the National Library and typed them up. That was how Hugh MacDiarmid read his works and then championed his ideas [...] Her first husband wrote a biography of MacLean and lent the only copy of the manuscript to the West Indian Socialist CLR James, who left it on a London <b>Tube</b> <b>train.</b> Nan painstakingly reconstructed it for her own biography. Her devotion was remarkable because she hardly knew her father. He became separated from his wife and family when she was an infant because he had time for nothing except work.|$|E

It has always seemed to me that the {{difficulties}} of their life are greatly exaggerated--generally by themselves. In a large country like Africa, for instance, I should imagine that it was almost impossible for a man not to get somewhere if he goes on long enough. Give me the fellow who can plunge into the bowels of the earth at Piccadilly Circus and find the right <b>Tube</b> <b>train</b> with nothing but a lot of misleading signs to guide him. However, we are not all constituted alike in this world, and it was apparent from the flush on her cheek and the light in her eyes that Betty admired explorers.|$|E
