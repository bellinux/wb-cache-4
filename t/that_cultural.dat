Brown said <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> differences led to the investigation. The investigation centered around allegations that Brown had made two female United States Peace Corps volunteers feel uncomfortable.|$|E

For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the ANC {{held to the}} belief that its primary {{activity}} was political organising, and that any cultural activity was secondary to this. This belief began to shift with the establishment of the Mayibuye Cultural Ensemble in 1975, and the Amandla Cultural Ensemble later in the 1970s. Mayibuye was established as a growing number of ANC activists argued <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> events needed to form a part of their work, and could be used to raise awareness of apartheid, gather support, and drive political change. The group was established by ANC activists Barry Feinberg and Ronnie Kasrils, who named it after the slogan Mayibuye iAfrika (Let Africa Return). The group consisted of several South African performers, and used a mixture of songs, poetry, and narrative in their performance, which described life under the apartheid government and their struggle against it. The songs were often performed in three- or four-part harmony. The group performed more than 200 times across Europe, and were seen as the cultural arm of the ANC. The group experienced personal and organisational difficulties, and disbanded in 1980.|$|E

5|$|The brigade was {{organized}} as a training brigade preparing Army Reserve and Army National Guard units for deployment. The brigade prepares other units for mobilization and provides training, assistance, {{and support to}} them during pre-deployment exercises, and evaluates performance and progress of these units as they are deploying. Since its reactivation, the brigade has specialized in training provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) deploying to Afghanistan. In early 2007, the 189th Infantry Brigade, along with the 158th Infantry Brigade, cooperated to train the first 12 PRTs at once at Fort Bragg for three-month training exercises. PRT personnel were trained {{in a wide range}} of scenarios, ranging from hospital repairs to childbirth scenarios and language labs.Afterwards, they conducted a conference on the training, in which it was decided <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> awareness and language training needed to be stressed for future PRTs. It was during this training that the brigade finally received its distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia on 25 May 2008. In early 2008, the Brigade began training another group of 12 PRTs. Several months later, the Brigades began training the next 12 PRTs for a 270-day deployment to Afghanistan.|$|E

The book received few reviews, including one produced by Edmund Leach for Nature which was highly critical, claiming that Clark's functionalist and culturally evolutionary approach was outdated. He then produced a sequel, Symbols of Excellence, which allowed him to discuss his interest in art; it was published by Cambridge University Press in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Bahá'u'lláh stressed, however, {{that the}} {{auxiliary}} language should not suppress existing natural languages, {{and that the}} concept of unity in diversity must be applied to languages.

The Bahá'í teachings state that having an international auxiliary language would remove the pressure from the natural aggrandizement of majority language groups and thus preserve minority languages, since each person would keep their own mother-tongue, and thus minority cultures.|$|E

25|$|Studies on the {{formation}} of early states {{tend to focus on}} processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations and the Malagasy civilization in Madagascar. Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 UNESCO report showed <b>that</b> <b>cultural</b> {{exchange}} {{is becoming more}} frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the European Union's shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.|$|E

During the numerous years of Dutch economic growth the average GDP per capita increased by 0.18 per cent per annum; at about 1810 the growth rate was about 1 per cent annually. Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples such as rye and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then were reexported around Europe and the world.|$|E
