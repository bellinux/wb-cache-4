5|$|Beginning {{development}} in 1987, it was conceived by designer and writer Shouzou Kaga: he wanted <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> <b>the</b> strategic elements of Famicom Wars with {{the characters and}} story of a role-playing video game.

While initial sales and critical reception were lackluster, it later became popular, launching the Fire Emblem series. The game would later be credited with popularizing the tactical role-playing genre in general.|$|E
