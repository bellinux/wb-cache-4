5000|$|The home plant of YS&T {{was known}} as the Campbell Works located in Campbell and Struthers, Ohio. This plant {{contained}} four blast furnaces, twelve open hearth furnaces, several blooming mills, two Bessemer converters, a slabbing mill, a butt-weld tube mill, a 79" [...] hot strip mill, seamless tube mills, and 9" [...] and 12" [...] bar mills at the Struthers Works. The Brier Hill Works consisted of two blast furnaces named Grace and Jeannette, twelve open hearth furnaces, a 40" [...] blooming mill, a 35" [...] intermediate blooming mill, a 24" [...] round mill, 84" [...] and 132" [...] plate mills, and an electric-weld tube mill. During much of the Depression, the Brier Hill works was shut down, but it reopened in 1937. Much of the reopened plant's production comprised <b>tube</b> <b>rounds</b> for the Campbell seamless tube mills. Due to the imbalance of ironmaking and steelmaking facilities at the two plants, rail shipments of molten iron [...] "hot metal" [...] were made from Campbell to Brier Hill from 1937 until 1979.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using Oyane ductile {{fracture}} criterion, a 2 -D coupled thermo-mechanical simulation of center crack occurrence in round billet during 2 -roll rotary rolling process is {{presented with the}} aid of FE code MSC. Superform. Based on an existing flat-die-model, an improved FE model is advanced, in which not only the influence of roll feed angle and entry cone angle but also the diameter of the piercing roll on the process are taken into account. By adopting the parameters of the Diescher piercer in 140 mm Mandrel Mill of Bao Steel in China, the distribution and development of strain/stress in <b>tube</b> <b>rounds</b> are analyzed, and the eigenvalue of {{ductile fracture}} as well. The critical percentage of diameter reduction is obtained from the simulation. The result shows a good agreement with the experimental value, and therefore is of widely guiding significance to practical process for rationally formulating deformation parameters of steel tube piercing...|$|E

40|$|Metallic {{thin-walled}} <b>round</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are widely}} used as energy absorption elements. However, lateral splash of the <b>round</b> <b>tubes</b> under impact loadings reduces the energy absorption efficiency and may cause secondary damages. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} assemble and fasten <b>round</b> <b>tubes</b> together by boundary constraints and/or fasteners between tubes, which increases the time and labor cost and affects the mechanical performance of <b>round</b> <b>tubes.</b> In an effort to break through this limitation, a novel self-locked energy-absorbing system has been proposed in this paper. The proposed system is made up of thin-walled tubes with dumbbell-shaped cross section, which are specially designed to interlock with each other and thus provide lateral constraint under impact loadings. Both finite element simulations and impact experiment demonstrated that without boundary constraints or fasteners between tubes, the proposed self-locked energy-absorbing system can still effectively attenuate impact loads while the <b>round</b> <b>tube</b> systems fail to carry load due to the lateral splashing of tubes. Furthermore, the optimal geometric design for a single dumbbell-shaped tube and the optimal stacking arrangement for the system are discussed, and a general guideline on the structural design of the proposed self-locked energy absorbing system is provided.

40|$|AbstractHeat {{recovery}} from exhaust gas streams is applicable {{to a wide}} variety of industries. However, high heat transfer resistance of gases and the presence of entrained particulate matter that readily fouls limits industry uptake of current heat recovery technology. Improvements to standard heat exchanger designs are needed. In this study Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the effect of ten different tube cross-sections on heat transfer resistance, gas flow resistance and foulability. The average wall shear stress around the shape is used to predict foulability and an estimated asymptotic fouling resistance is used to calculate an equivalent fouled Coulburn j factor, jf. CFD results show the best tube for exhaust heat recovery is an elliptical tube closely followed by the flattened <b>round</b> <b>tube.</b> The ellipse shape produced fouled Coulburn j factor, jf values, expressed as a ratio of tube bank friction factor f, over 100 % higher than that of standard <b>round</b> <b>tube.</b> A flattened <b>round</b> <b>tube</b> is also promising, given enough spacing between the tubes, and may be the practical economic optimum...|$|R

Two problems encountered in exhaust gas heat recovery are: the high heat transfer resistance of gases and the presence of entrained particulate matter, which can limit the use of extended surface area.

For a wider acceptance, and major heat pump market expansion, it is crucial to develop heat pumps that cause minimal disturbance. Results from field measurements made by SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden indicate that the use of indirect heat pumps has potential to significantly reduce the outdoor noise level of ambient air heat pumps. The noise level caused by such heat pumps {{has been shown to be}} highly influenced by the design of the air-to-fluid heat exchanger. The overall purpose of this study is to propose a design of an air-to-fluid heat exchanger that allows for a well performing system as well as a low level of noise and cost. Two different types of heat exchangers, with flat <b>tubes</b> and <b>round</b> <b>tubes,</b> are compared theoretically. According to the modelling results, a heat exchanger with flat tubes and plain fins is the most suitable out of the studied designs due to its low heat transfer resistance on the <b>tube</b> side.
