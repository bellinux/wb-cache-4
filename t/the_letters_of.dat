5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> both of Jef's names.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit {{contract}} and the collection contract The diploma thesis {{deals with the}} topic of the Direct Debit Contract and <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit. A <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit is a special payment instrument issued as a rule by a bank that the principal has undertaken to pay to the person in whose interest <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit is open and designated as the authorized amount up to the amount agreed. The Direct Debit is the commitment of the collector of receivables to obtain from the third party a receipt of a sum of money or other Direct Debit. Current legislation, contained in the Civil Code, took over the legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit and <b>the</b> Direct Debit from the Commercial Code without any major changes.

5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history and {{insights}} of everyday crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent from the various crew members {{to family and friends}} while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as The Monitor Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{style is}} found in several centres on the Continent in the tenth century. In Italy, the leading proponents were Liutprand of Cremona, Eugenius Vulgarius and Atto of Vercelli.

French works which display the hermeneutic style include Dudo of Saint-Quentin's Gesta Normanniae Ducum and the Libellus Sacerdotalis by Lios Monocus.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{names of}} the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters.

50|$|Lipiński {{became one}} of the {{prominent}} critics of the government. His position as a known Marxist economist shielded him to certain extent from government persecution and allowed him to say things many others were unable to. Nevertheless, till the very end he remained convinced that some form of socialism is preferable to capitalism. He signed three public <b>letters</b> criticizing <b>the</b> communist government: <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> 34 in 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> 59 in 1975 and <b>the</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> 14 in 1976.

5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar Lucien Stiernon places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek Apostolos D. Karpozilos rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
50|$|After a sales {{contract}} has been negotiated and <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit has {{been agreed upon}} as the method of payment, the Applicant will contact a bank {{to ask for a}} <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit to be issued, and once the issuing bank has ascertained that the Applicant will be able to pay for the goods, it will issue <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit. Once <b>the</b> Beneficiary receives <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit, it will check the terms to ensure that it matches with the contract and will either arrange for shipment of the goods or ask for an amendment to <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit so that it meets with the terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit is limited in terms of time, the validity of credit, the last date of shipment, and in terms of how much late after shipment the documents may be presented to the Nominated Bank.|$|R

5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
5|$|He {{was tried}} and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence– {{execution}} by hanging– {{was to be}} carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he could write a justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two failed suicide attempts with his wife, who {{died as a result of}} the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp's Confession was published in 1826. Some editions included <b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> Ann Cook as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.|$|E
