5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus {{were described as}} a separate species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis of}} a rufous chestnut cap and a rooting stipe, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a taxonomic revision of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, Boletus regineus. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and belong in a different porcini lineage.|$|E
5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E

Most assisted openers use flippers as their opening mechanism. Assisted opening knives can be as fast or faster than automatic knives to deploy.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{stuttering}} {{behaviors are}} the overt, observable signs of speech disfluencies, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> {{from the normal}} dysfluencies found in all speakers in that stuttering dysfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain. Stuttering dysfluencies also vary in quality: common dysfluencies tend to be repeated movements, fixed postures, or superfluous behaviors. Each of these three categories is composed of subgroups of stutters and dysfluencies.|$|E

25|$|In the {{creation}} myths of Polynesian mythology are found various {{concepts of the}} heavens and the underworld. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> from one island to another. What they share is {{the view of the}} universe as an egg or coconut that is divided between the world of humans (earth), the upper world of heavenly gods, and the underworld. Each of these is subdivided in a manner reminiscent of Dante's Divine Comedy, but the number of divisions and their names differs from one Polynesian culture to another.|$|E
25|$|Variety angulata Moore, {{and variety}} abnormis Moore, have been {{described}} from Burma and Tenasserim. Typically, <b>these</b> <b>differ</b> slightly from A. echerius as follows: Upperside with no purple gloss; the discal and postdiscal transverse bands more clearly defined, the former sometimes white anteriorly on the upperside, generally white or whitish on the underside and extending across both forewings and hindwings; underside of hindwing with an extra, subterminal black spot. The white markings and the extra black spot are variable characters, and specimens intermediate between typical A. echerius and typical angulata or abnormis are not uncommon.|$|E

25|$|Conidia are asexual {{reproductive}} (reproduction {{without the}} fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. Another type of cell is a conidial anastomosis tube (CAT); <b>these</b> <b>differ</b> from germ tubes {{in that they}} are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial anastomosis tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.|$|E
25|$|A superbone uses a {{full set}} of valves and a slide. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves {{operated}} by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the F attachment, which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A buccin is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.|$|E

LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as Monte Carlo methods and finite difference methods, as well as the nature of the products being modeled.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between Holyrood and Westminster is an evolving one {{where there is}} some evidence of policy divergence. Underpinning policy approaches are different views of social citizenship, with the Holyrood approach maintaining elements of the post- 1945 welfare settlement. The place of refugees and asylum seekers within <b>these</b> <b>differing</b> approaches is currently underexplored. This article looks at the Scottish and UK Governments’ views of social rights and how they apply to asylum seekers and refugees. It suggests that despite refugee ‘policy’ being at least partly reserved, the Scottish Government has been able to take a different approach from that of Westminster, an approach underpinned by <b>these</b> <b>differing</b> welfare outlooks...|$|R
25|$|Unlike modern lizards, dinosaur teeth grew {{individually}} in the sockets of the jawbones, {{which are}} known as the alveoli. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> from teeth of other vertebrates, which are directly fused to {{the bones of the}} jaw. Teeth that were lost were replaced by teeth below the roots in each tooth socket. Occlusion refers to the closing of the dinosaur's mouth, where the teeth from the upper and lower parts of the jaw meet. If the occlusion causes teeth from the maxillary or premaxillary bones to cover the teeth of the dentary and predentary, the dinosaur is said to have an overbite, the most common condition in this group. The opposite condition is considered to be an underbite, which is rare in theropod dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the notion}} of {{permutation}} relates to the act of arranging {{all the members of}} a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three element set. As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.|$|E
25|$|Mobbing {{calls are}} signals {{made by the}} mobbing species while harassing a predator. <b>These</b> <b>differ</b> from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics {{to escape from the}} predator. The great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less {{effective}} at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.|$|E
