500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} Gregory's {{belief in the}} infinity of God is his belief that God, as limitless, is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings. In Life of Moses, Gregory writes: [...] "...every concept that comes from some comprehensible image, by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature, constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God." [...] Gregory's theology was thus apophatic: he proposed that God should be {{defined in terms of}} what we know He is not rather <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might speculate Him to be.|$|E

The author of the ICWA, Senator Jim Abourezk, initially stated that this is [...] "something totally different <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> intended at the time" [...] but two weeks later said that the main intent of the law was to ensure that tribes had an opportunity to sign off on the adoption of tribal children.|$|E

500|$|Besides directing, Leni was {{a painter}} and set designer. The sets of the film were {{designed}} by Leni and fabricated by Charles D. Hall, who later designed the sets of Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931). Leni hoped to eschew realism for visual designs that reflected the emotions of characters. He wrote, [...] "It is not extreme reality that the camera perceives, but {{the reality of the}} inner event, which is more profound, effective and moving <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see through everyday eyes ...."

So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory").

500|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for the group with gruelling schedules including spending over thirteen weeks in America filming the first series of their show and their subsequent television specials, the members often felt that the travelling {{back and forth from}} the UK and the US was [...] "perhaps more tiring <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were actually going out to America to do". Paul Cattermole once commented that the speed of the schedule sometimes caused a [...] "kind of dreamscape in your head", as the group often felt [...] "jetlagged and tired". On top of the filming schedules, the group often performed at high-profile pop music festivals such as Party in the Park where they performed for 100,000 fans. The intensity of the schedule would be a constant battle for the group and was going to continue to take its toll for all the years S Club 7 were together. In spite of this, the group always remained in solidarity that they were all good friends, [...] "cared for each other a lot" [...] and supported each other through difficult times in the group.|$|E

John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory".

[...] The song focuses on two characters; Reynolds' vocals supply a revolutionary perspective, and Rory Clewlow's are those of a person in power. [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] has unconventional lyrics for its characters; [...] "Yabba Dabba do one, son" [...] was described by Reynolds as the product of a drunken MC battle, and during the song the other band members pause and urge Reynolds to calm down. Reynolds described [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] as a [...] "lively electro influenced dubstep" [...] and a [...] "rap rock pileup" [...] textured over [...] "wobbly dubstep bass".|$|E

Vela also lauded Selena's capability to quickly [...] " [...] the phrasing of the song, the meaning of the song, the gist of what it was trying to convey", finding it to be the equivalent of acting in a film.

500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [...] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU.

500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular {{kind of things that}} were on the album."

500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude {{with a lot of}} people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E
