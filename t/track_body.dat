50|$|Mechanical {{motion capture}} systems {{directly}} <b>track</b> <b>body</b> joint angles {{and are often}} referred to as exoskeleton motion capture systems, due to the way the sensors are attached to the body. A performer attaches the skeletal-like structure to their body and as they move so do the articulated mechanical parts, measuring the performer’s relative motion. Mechanical motion capture systems are real-time, relatively low-cost, free-of-occlusion, and wireless (untethered) systems that have unlimited capture volume. Typically, they are rigid structures of jointed, straight metal or plastic rods linked together with potentiometers that articulate at the joints of the body. These suits tend to be in the $25,000 to $75,000 range plus an external absolute positioning system. Some suits provide limited force feedback or haptic input.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Hamm Railway Bridge was a double-track bridge {{built by}} the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company from April 1868 as the first solid bridge across the Rhine in Düsseldorf and was opened on 24 July 1870. It was named the König-Wilhelm-Brücke ("King William Bridge") or König-Wilhelm-Eisenbahn-Rheinbrücke (“King William railway bridge across the Rhine”) after the Prussian King [...] William I. It was built as a wrought iron arch supporting a three-span truss to plans of the engineer Pichier of the Harkort Company (Harkort’sche Fabrik) of Duisburg. The bridge towers on both sides reflected not only a need for architectural decoration, but also a desire to promote the military security of the bridge {{in the event of}} a war. For the same reason there was an outer fort at the side of the bridge, which was removed in 1885. Between July and September 1896, the approaches to the bridge were repaired and the <b>track</b> <b>body</b> was renewed under traffic. The whole construction was carried out in heavy traffic with all traffic handled on a single track. After 1896 the greatly increasing train traffic necessitated the building of additional infrastructure to complement the bridge. Between 1909 and 1911, a second, parallel, double-track bridge was built only 32 m upstream. It was built with the same distance between the piers, with a more modern and stronger superstructure as an iron truss arch. As with the older bridge there were bridge towers, but they were larger and stronger.|$|E

These tracking systems estimate the pose of <b>tracking</b> <b>bodies</b> attached to objects within a tracking volume. In this work, we explore the case of tracking the origins of joints of articulated robots when the <b>tracking</b> <b>bodies</b> are mounted on limbs or structures relative to the joints.

40|$|The {{flight pattern}} of many fly species {{consists}} of straight flight segments interspersed with rapid turns called body saccades, {{a strategy that}} is thought to minimize motion blur. We analyzed the body saccades of fruit flies (Drosophila hydei), using high-speed 3 D videography to <b>track</b> <b>body</b> and wing kinematics and a dynamically-scaled robot to study the production of aerodynamic forces and moments. Although the size, degree and speed of the saccades vary, {{the dynamics of the}} maneuver are remarkably stereotypic. In executing a body saccade, flies perform a quick roll and counter-roll, combined with a slower unidirectional rotation around their yaw axis. Flies regulate the size of the turn by adjusting the magnitude of torque that they produce about these control axes, while maintaining the orientation of the rotational axes in the body frame constant. In this way, body saccades are different from escape responses in the same species, in which the roll and pitch component of banking is varied to adjust turn angle. Our analysis of the wing kinematics and aerodynamics showed that flies control aerodynamic torques during the saccade primarily by adjusting the timing and amount of span-wise wing rotation...|$|E

To compensate for this, we present a novel standpoint where occluded images of objects may be considered as data missing from a time series. Thus we can consider this as a new application of the "missing data" problem studied in other fields dealing with time series data applied to the classic computer vision problem of occlusion. Using this approach, we consider three ways of compensating for occlusion - namely polynomial interpolation, autoregressive prediction and coupled time/frequency domain interpolation. We propose an experimental instantiation using a gait dataset and analyzing the motion of colored markers attached to body parts. The actual and predicted positions are compared which show our approach holds promise for complete occlusion compensation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a new {{formulation}} for the problem of human motion tracking in video. Tracking is still a challenging problem when strong appearance changes occur as in videos of human in motion. Most trackers rely on a predefined template or on a training dataset to achieve detection and tracking. Therefore they are not efficient to track objects which appearance is not known in advance. A solution is to use an online method that updates iteratively a subspace of reference target models. In addition, we propose to integrate color and motion cues in a particle filter framework to track human body parts. The algorithm process consists in two modes, switching between detection and tracking. Detection steps involve trained classifiers to update estimated positions of the tracking windows, whereas tracking steps rely on an adaptative color-based particle filter coupled with optical flow estimations. The Earth Mover distance is used to compare color models in a global fashion, and constraints on flow features avoid drifting effects. The proposed method has revealed its efficiency to <b>track</b> <b>body</b> parts in motion and can cope with full appearance changes.

40|$|Past {{three decades}} {{witnessed}} a {{growing interest in}} biped walking robots because of their advantageous use in the human environment. However, their control is challenging because of their many degrees of freedom and non-linearities in their dynamics. Various trajectory generation and walking control approaches ranging from open loop walking to systems with many sensors and feedback loops {{have been reported in the}} literature. The tuning of the parameters of reference gait is a common complication encountered. Another important problem of the walking control is the contact transients at the instant of landing. The method presented in this thesis generated position references for the upper body. Optimization techniques are employed to obtain suitable leg joint torques for the supporting leg to <b>track</b> <b>body</b> reference trajectories. Locomotion is achieved by a swinging leg control scheme, which is based on position control on certain directions, and artificial gravity compensation on certain directions. Soft landing and low impedance problem of the legs can easily be handled with this scheme. Another advantage is that limited number of parameters is required for gait generation. 3 D dynamics and ground interaction simulation techniques are employed for a 12 -DOF biped robot to test the proposed method.

40|$|Background: The use of {{hospital}} bed side rails for increased mobility and safety for elderly and high fall risk patients {{has become a}} controversial topic. The suggested removal of side rails to prevent entrapment, as recommended by Consumer Federation of America, increases the risk that a patient may {{fall out of the}} bed. Additionally, without side rails, patients may require additional assistance from nurses to reposition patients in bed, which increases the risk of back injuries among nurses (Jang et al. 2007).

Results: With 6. 2 ± 4. 3 kg of weight loss, %FM, as determined by DXA and ADP, significantly decreased by 3. 9 ± 2. 9 % and 3. 9 ± 3. 3 % respectively.

Furthermore, the Bland-Altman plots demonstrated no systematic bias for Δ%FM (r = – 0. 20, p = 0. 17). However, %FM by ADP (r = 0. 42) at baseline and Δ%FM by ADP (r = – 0. 54) were significantly correlated to the differences between Δ%FM by DXA and ADP.
