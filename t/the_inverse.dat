5|$|Placing {{an integer}} {{superscript}} after the name or {{symbol of a}} function, as if the function were being raised to a power, commonly refers to repeated function composition rather than repeated multiplication. Thus, f 3(x) may mean f(f(f(x))); in particular, f −1(x) usually denotes <b>the</b> <b>inverse</b> function of f. Iterated functions are {{of interest in the}} study of fractals and dynamical systems. Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1/2(x).|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input and stores a halved value for later use. Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by one bit is performed {{and the result}} subtracted from the magic number 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of <b>the</b> <b>inverse</b> square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inverse</b> {{square root}} of a {{floating}} point number {{is used in}} calculating a normalized vector.
