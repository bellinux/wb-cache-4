40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{correlation}} between the patient rotational error measured with pul-monary point registration and tumor shift after bony anatomy matching in stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung cancer. Methods: Twenty-six patients with lung cancer who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy were the subjects. On 104 cone-beam computed tomography measurements performed prior to radiation delivery, rotational setup errors were measured with point registration using pul-monary structures. Translational registration using bony anatomy matching was done and the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>vector</b> of tumor displacement was measured retrospectively. Correlation among the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>vector</b> and rotational error and vertebra–tumor distance was investigated quantitatively. Results: The median and maximum rotational errors of the roll, pitch and yaw were 0. 8, 0. 9 and 0. 5, and 6. 0, 4. 5 and 2. 5, respectively. Bony anatomy matching resulted in a 0. 2 – 1. 6 cm <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>vector</b> of tumor shift. The shift became larger as the vertebra–tumor dis-tance increased. Multiple regression analysis for the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>vector</b> indicated {{that in the case of}} bony anatomy matching, tumor shifts of 5 and 10 mm were expected for verte-bra–tumor distances of 4. 46 and 14. 1 cm, respectively. Conclusions: Using pulmonary point registration, it was found that the rotational setup error influences the tumor shift. Bony anatomy matching is not appropriate for hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy with a tight margin. Key words: lung-radoncol – radiation therapy – SBRT – rotation – setup – erro...|$|R

An adaptive sampling approach is introduced and used to seed streamlines in a more meaningful and efficient manner. Cell-locking is a new concept that isolates regions of a data set that do not contain separatrices.
