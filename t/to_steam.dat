5|$|All the {{stations}} {{along the line}} were designed by Paul Armin Due, with all but the terminal station built in wood. Flekkefjord Station was built as a three-story brick building in Art Nouveau. In addition, there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord. Passengers could transfer <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> ship services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} decade after {{nationalisation}} services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant {{a wider variety of}} locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel train on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and the branch reverted <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> operations.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event that she needed to be towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1914, {{the annual}} summer cruise to Norway began. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet {{conducted}} drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> back to Germany, {{as a result}} of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skadenes before returning to port, where it remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July Ostfriesland and the rest of ISquadron was back in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1957 the BBC {{produced}} a live outside broadcast from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated {{on a trip}} from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No.1 Talyllyn returned <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> after an extensive overhaul.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, Bismarck {{received}} the order <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> to Kiel. On the way, {{the ship was}} escorted by several Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters {{and a pair of}} armed merchant vessels, along with an icebreaker. At 08:45 on 8 March, Bismarck briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of dazzle paint to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March. On 17 March, the old battleship , now used as an icebreaker, escorted Bismarck through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.|$|E
50|$|The Great Western Railway (GWR) was {{established}} under {{the vision of}} Isambard Kingdom Brunel, to link London to North America on the quickest possible route, with steamships landing passengers and goods in West Wales as opposed <b>to</b> <b>steaming</b> <b>to</b> an English port. Further, such a port link could also provide quicker access to Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Fletcher {{saw many}} {{similarities}} {{between humans and}} functioning machines. He posited several analogies between machines and the human body. Just some of the comparisons that Fletcher drew included: fuel <b>to</b> food; <b>steam</b> <b>to</b> blood circulation; <b>steam</b> gauge <b>to</b> human pulse; and engine to heart.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was not prepared to spend further money at this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{preference}} toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into seaplane carriers during World War I. They carried only {{two to four}} aircraft each, however, and were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which was fast enough <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> with the Fleet, was converted into a seaplane carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes. The plan for the conversion was drawn up by Leutnant zur See Jürgen Reimpell in 1918, {{an officer of the}} 1st Aviation Detachment.|$|E
5|$|Seven S15s {{have been}} preserved, two Urie {{examples}} and five by Maunsell, {{and can be}} seen at several heritage railways around the country. All the surviving members of the class were purchased from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. Currently only 499 and 830 have yet <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> in preservation. 825, 828 and 841 have all operated on the main line at certain points in their preservation careers, though 825 has only run between Grosmont & Whitby.|$|E

5|$|Steam's {{primary service}} {{is to allow}} its users to {{download}} games and other software {{that they have in}} their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these titles since they had sole access to the Steam's database and engine, but with the introduction of the Steamworks software development kit (SDK) in May 2008, anyone could potentially become a publisher <b>to</b> <b>Steam,</b> outside of Valve's involvement to curate titles on the service.|$|E
5|$|The B's use of {{electrification}} {{instead of}} steam {{power in a}} Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, marked the first use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives <b>to</b> <b>steam</b> power in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
