25|$|The next Annual Report had {{virtually}} {{nothing to say}} about how and why the Irish banking system collapsed. Although there were four Central Bank directors {{on the board of the}} Financial Regulator, the Central Bank maintained it had no powers to intervene in the market. Yet, the Central Bank had the power <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>directives</b> to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.|$|E
500|$|Wilton's {{position}} as CCOSC had no statutory {{authority over the}} heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam. David Horner noted that in an emergency, Wilton [...] "had <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>directives</b> and then seek retrospective endorsement of them by either the minister or the Chiefs of Staff Committee." [...] According to historian Eric Andrews, Wilton [...] "chaffed over his lack of command over the services and the need for organisational reform". While CGS, he had joined Scherger in calling for a single Australian Defence Force organisation with one Minister of Defence, in contrast to the existing arrangement where each service operated with virtual autonomy, supported by its own minister and department. [...] In July 1967, he became a member of the Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee to plan a tri-service military academy, which was eventually opened as the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986. He was also able to push through a plan to establish, in 1970, the Joint Intelligence Organisation to replace the former Joint Intelligence Bureau and three single-service intelligence groups.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I defend {{a form of}} epistocracy I call limited epistocracy— rule by {{institutions}} housing expertise in non-political areas that become politically relevant. This kind of limited epistocracy, I argue, isn’t a far-off fiction. With increasing frequency, governments are outsourcing political power to expert institutions to solve urgent, multidimensional problems because they outperform ordinary democratic decision-making. I consider the objection that limited epistocracy, while more effective than its competitors, lacks a fundamental intrinsic value that its competitors have; namely, political inclusion. After explaining this challenge, I suggest that limited epistocracies can be made compatible with robust political inclusion if specialized institutions are confined <b>to</b> <b>issuing</b> <b>directives</b> that give citizens multiple actionable options. I explain how this safeguards citizens’ inclusion through rational deliberation, choice, and contestation...|$|R

One such act, passed in 1937 by the Gheorghe Tătărescu cabinet, prohibited {{the activities of}} Inochentists, whom it grouped together with the Old Calendar Orthodox, the Pentecostals, the Nazarenes, the Apostolic Faith Church of God, Jehovah's Witnesses and Bible societies. Official Christian propaganda warned Romanians to shun the dissident preachers, who lacked [...] "the godly gift of preaching God's law", be they Inochentists, [...] "Tudorites" [...] or Adventists. Interest {{in the activities of}} Inochenție's followers was kept alive by Romanian writer Sabin Velican, in his 1939 novel Pământ nou ("New Land"); it fictionalizes the movement's alleged sexual practices.|$|R

25|$|In addition, the {{constitution}} grants the central government, acting through the President, the power <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> certain <b>directives</b> <b>to</b> {{the government of}} a state {{in relation to the}} use of minority languages for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.|$|R
25|$|Debate {{continues}} {{as to the}} origins of the unidentified ghost rockets. In 1946, however, it was thought likely that they originated from the former German rocket facility at Peenemünde, and were long-range tests by the Russians of captured German V-1 or V-2 missiles, or perhaps another early form of cruise missile because of the ways they were sometimes seen to maneuver. This prompted the Swedish Army <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> a <b>directive</b> stating that newspapers were not to report the exact location of ghost rocket sightings, or any information regarding the direction or speed of the object. This information, they reasoned, was vital for evaluation purposes to the nation or nations performing the tests.|$|R

50|$|The Poor Law Commission was {{independent}} of Parliament. This made it vulnerable to criticism from those inside Parliament. In the parishes the commissioners were almost universally hated.

50|$|The {{legislative}} {{model for}} implementing {{a set of}} international labour standards is the best known. This model involves the enactment and enforcement of labour standards by a legislative body across a union of countries. Social policies regarding employment and labour typically fall into three areas: free movement of labour, prevention of social dumping via low labour standards, and dialogue between labour and management. This model has been adopted by the European Community, part of the European Union, and is also the model taken by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Organisations, such as these, are given the authority, {{through a series of}} procedures, <b>to</b> then <b>issue</b> <b>directives</b> in any of these areas of labour policy. Member states must comply with these directives; however, what compliance actually means and entails is left to the discretion of each member state.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{and rural}} local {{authorities}} constitute the lowest tier of Zimbabwe's multilevel system of government. These {{local governments have}} a constitutional "right to govern" that must be exercised within the constitutional, legislative and policy framework. Under the old constitutional order, the national government could supervise urban local authorities, for example by <b>issuing</b> policy <b>directives</b> <b>to</b> ensure that these authorities governed {{in a manner that}} enabled them to deliver on national and local goals. This article examines this supervisory instrument, the powers it gives the national government, its use in practice and its relevance under the new constitutional order. The main argument is that supervisory instruments, such as the power <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> policy <b>directives</b> <b>to</b> local governments, are necessary in any multilevel system of government. However, such supervisory powers must be balanced with the need for local autonomy, to allow local governments to deliver on their service delivery obligations and development mandate. IS...|$|R

The Court of Appeal ruled that Paulwell’s directive was outside his ministerial powers and invalid, and the OUR had no obligation to comply with it. Digicel then again appealed the ruling by taking the matter to the Privy Council, Jamaica’s final court of appeal, though it proved unsuccessful after the Privy Council, upholding {{the decision of the}} Court of Appeal, again ruled that Paulwell’s directive was ultra vires and that OUR had been correct in ignoring him.|$|R
