5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E

Entering the ticketing gate, travelers can take the escalators or stairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> areas on the second floor. Two waiting areas for passengers that lead to the northbound and southbound trains are connected by an air bridge. Two escalators and one stairway take passengers to the platforms. There are ten emergency exits around the platforms.|$|E
5|$|König {{took part}} in several fleet sorties in support of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group; however, due to her {{grounding}} outside Wilhelmshaven, the ship missed the first operation of these battlecruisers {{on the night of}} 15–16 December 1914, when they were tasked with bombarding the English coast to lure out a portion of the British Grand Fleet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> German fleet. On 22 January 1915, König and the rest of IIISquadron were detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic. They returned to the North Sea on 11 February, too late to assist the IScouting Group at the Battle of Dogger Bank.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{conduct an}} {{experimental}} study <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> impact of {{two types of}} waiting information - waiting-duration information and queuing information - on consumers' reactions to waits of different lengths. The authors test a model that includes three different constructs - perceived waiting duration, acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>wait,</b> and affective response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> - as mediators between waiting information and service evaluation. Results show that though acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> and affective response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> have a significant mediating effect on <b>the</b> relationship between <b>waiting</b> information and service evaluation, perceived waiting duration does not. Moreover, neither type of information has significant impact in the short-wait condition, whereas waiting-duration information has greater impact than queuing information in the intermediate-wait condition and a smaller impact in the long-wait condition. The authors conclude {{with a discussion of}} research and managerial implications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

While this was taking place the mourners were escorted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to land in}} Brønnøysund was a Hansa-Brandenburg seaplane of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service on 23 July 1922. It was piloted by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Lützow-Holm, en route from Horten to Kirkenes. The following thirteen years Brønnøysund only saw occasional landings, when Norwegian Air Lines started a service from Bergen to Tromsø on 7 June 1935, which included {{a stop at the}} harbor in Brønnøysund. Passengers and mail would be rowed out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> aircraft. The first season the route was flown using a single-engine Junkers W 34. The aircraft turned out to be too small and a larger Junkers Ju 52 was introduced the following season. Flights were dependent on good weather and were only operated during the summer. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1938. All civilian flights were terminated during World War II, although the town would see occasional military landings.|$|E

25|$|The Keelmen of Tyne and Wear were a {{group of}} men who worked on the keels, large boats that carried the coal from the banks of both rivers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> collier ships. Because of the shallowness of both rivers, it was {{difficult}} for ships of any significant draught to move up river and load with coal from the place where the coal reached the riverside. Thus the need for shallow-draught keels to transport the coal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> ships. The keelmen formed a close-knit and colourful community on both rivers until their eventual demise late in the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in English {{cities in the}} Middle Ages, Canterbury {{employed}} a town band known as <b>the</b> <b>Waits.</b> There are records of payments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waits</b> starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this. <b>The</b> <b>Waits</b> were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile. Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. A modern early music group called <b>The</b> Canterbury <b>Waits</b> has revived <b>the</b> name.|$|R

Because of the difficulty for colliers trying to navigate the shallow waters of the Wear, the coal was loaded onto keels (large boats) and taken downriver <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> colliers. The keels were manned by a close-knit group of workers known as 'keelmen'.|$|E

At the meeting, Ayalon did not display the Turkish flag, and pointed out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> media that the Turkish Ambassador sat on a lower sofa.

Cyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> area and onto the boat and bicycles must be stored in the designated bicycle storage area on each boat. Cyclists are subject to screening upon arrival at the ferry terminals. Bicycles may also be taken on the lowest deck of the ferry without charge.|$|E
25|$|In the Sandgate area, to {{the east}} of the city, and beside the river, resided the close-knit {{community}} of keelmen and their families.

In the 1630s, about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, {{more than one-third of the}} population. Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the epidemic; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British City in this period.|$|E
