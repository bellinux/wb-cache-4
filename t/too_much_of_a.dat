5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} cast, George Sewell stars as Mark Neuman, a German Operations Chief in EUROSEC who uncovers Dr Hassler's dealing with Communist China and whose parallel self directs the interrogation of Ross after the Dove crash. His surname {{in the draft}} script is Hallam. Finally, Ed Bishop stars as David Poulson, a NASA official. Bishop replaced English actor Peter Dyneley, who had voiced characters for Thunderbirds (1965–66), after the producers decided that Dyneley bore <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resemblance to Wymark and that scenes featuring both the characters of Poulson and Webb would confuse audiences.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the year}} that Jacob Rogers died and {{the same year that}} the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other {{locomotive}} manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again the shop superintendent. But Rogers was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or in research and development. ALCO and Baldwin, the two companies that were at the time the largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers' troubles was the greater city of Paterson that had grown up around the shop. There was not any room for Rogers to expand.|$|E
5|$|In November 1897, Frank Chapman {{sponsored}} Beebe {{to become}} an associate member of the American Ornithologists' Union, and the following month Beebe gave his first professional lecture on ornithology to a society called Uncle Clarence's Bergen Point Culture Club. In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies {{in favor of an}} invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was about to open. Several factors contributed to this decision, including both excitement at being part of the zoo, and the sense that his studies were putting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strain on his family's finances.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, {{as opposed to the}} more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E

The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under the pretense of being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch.|$|E

5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E
5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's {{draft was}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, {{and that the}} dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed {{to work on the}} script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E
5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward the future of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, {{even in the face of}} a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E
