40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{maximize}} throughput in end-system multicast, {{it is necessary}} to have fine-grained control over the <b>transmit</b> <b>load</b> of each participating member. This both avoids bottlenecks where members are overloaded, and allows heterogeneous members to contribute as much transmit capacity as they are able or willing to. In this paper, we describe and simulate an unstructured end-system multicast protocol called Chunkyspread that provides members with fine-grained control over their <b>transmit</b> <b>load,</b> scales well, has relatively low latencies, and can tolerate high membership churn. Chunkyspread is designed as a flexible framework that easily incorporates different constraints and optimizations. For instance, it is straightforward to add titfor-tat or path disjointness as constraints to the system. This paper demonstrates the performance of Chunkyspread through extensive simulations, and provides partial validation of these simulations on Emulab. It also provides detailed comparisons with Splitstream, a structured heterogeneous end-system multicast protocol. The simulations show that Chunkyspread provides far better control over <b>transmit</b> <b>load</b> than Splitstream, while exhibiting comparable or better latency and responsiveness to churn...|$|E

The most common methods for forming composite monotapes are the powder cloth, foil/fiber, plasma spray, and arc spray processes.

Adhesively bonded joints offer many advantages, but stress singularities {{can contribute to the}} initiation and the propagation of crack in adhesive joints. Therefore, designing adhesively bonded joints which strongly limit the influence of edge effects can significantly increases the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> by the assembly. Cylindrical joints are associated with high substrate strength in the radial direction, meaning that peel and cleavage forces have different effects compared to simple lap joints. But, for such assemblies, edge effects also exist. The aim of this paper is first to analyse stress concentrations in cylindrical joints in the case of axial loadings, starting from refined finite element computations under a linear elastic assumption. Thus as the stress state in the adhesive thickness can be complex associated to edge effects, simplified methods can lead to an overestimation of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> by the assembly as they generally are not able to represent effects of stress concentrations in the adhesive thickness.

40|$|Abstract — The rising {{popularity}} of live IPTV has triggered {{renewed interest in}} P 2 P multicast. In particular, the simple and robust ‘swarming ’ style of P 2 P multicast is currently favored over more traditional tree-based approaches, which are seen to be complex and fragile. Swarming approaches, however, exhibit a basic control-overhead-versus-latency tradeoff that gears it more towards high-volume, latency-tolerant applications. This paper presents a new unstructured P 2 P multicast protocol called Chunkyspread 1 that is tree-based yet simple and robust. Chunkyspread uses multiple trees to provide fine-grained control over member load, reacts quickly to membership changes, scales well, and has low overhead. This paper gives {{a detailed description of}} Chunkyspread and an apples-to-apples comparison with the DHT-based Splitstream multi-tree P 2 P multicast algorithm. We show that Chunkyspread exhibits far better control over <b>transmit</b> <b>load</b> than Splitstream, while exhibiting comparable or better latency and responsiveness to churn. This comparison establishes Chunkyspread as the ‘best of breed ’ among treebased P 2 P multicast algorithms, thus setting the stage for future comparisons with swarming-based approaches. I...|$|E

Bricks are normally used as infill materials in these framed structures. However, research has shown that bricks can also be used as external and internal masonry bearing walls. With the use of structural masonry construction method, cheaper and faster construction can be achieved. Savings are obtained by using less formwork and reinforcing steel, reducing construction time as lesser frames or none are used, and eliminating waiting time for the structural concrete to cure or gain their strength. Calcium silicate and sand cement bricks were tested for their mechanical properties. Investigations were carried out on six masonry bearing walls. Each unit measured 1000 mm × 1000 mm and a half brick thick. The structural behaviour due to compressive axial load was investigated and it shows that both bricks satisfy the requirement as load bearing wall.

40|$|Publisher's PDF. The {{mechanical}} function of soft collagenous tissues is largely determined by their hierarchical organization of collagen molecules. While collagen fibrils {{are believed to}} be discontinuous and transfer load through shearing of the interfibrillar matrix, interfibrillar shear stresses have never been quantified. Scaling traditional shear testing procedures down to the fibrillar length scale is impractical and would introduce substantial artifacts. Here, {{through the use of a}} novel microscopic variation of notch tension testing, we explicitly demonstrate the existence of interfibrillar shear stresses within tendon fascicles and provide the first measurement of their magnitude. Axial stress gradients along the sample length generated by notch tension testing were measured and used to calculate a value of 32 kPa for the interfibrillar shear stress. This estimate is comparable to the interfibrillar shear stress predicted by previous multiscale modeling of tendon fascicles, which supports the hypothesis that fibrils are discontinuous and <b>transmit</b> <b>load</b> through interfibrillar shear. This information regarding the structure-function relationships of tendon and other soft collagenous tissues is necessary to identify potential causes for tissue impairment with degeneration and provide the foundation for developing regenerative repair strategies or engineering biomaterials for tissue replacement.

Many measurement and imaging techniques, such as X-rays, have been utilized to investigate the movement of the residual femur within the stump during gait. However, due to associated health risks and costs, none of the current techniques have been extended to clinical prosthetics. The use of B-mode ultrasound has been suggested as a safe and cheap alternative, and has been utilized in previous studies to monitor the motion of the femur.

Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone {{interface}} than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating. This study investigated whether locked plating in osteoporotic diaphyseal bone causes a greater periprosthetic fracture risk than conventional plating because of stress concentrations at the plate end. It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a conventional screw {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis. Constructs were tested dynamically to failure in bending, torsion, and axial loading to determine failure loads and failuremodes. A locked plating construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost locking screw in locked plating constructs was replaced with a conventional screw to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional plating construct, the locked plating construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the locked end screw with a conventional screw increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the locked plating construct.

5000|$|The unique {{plantigrade}} {{alignment of}} the human foot results in a distal-limb structure that can adapt {{to a variety of}} conditions. The less mobile and more robust tarsal bones are shaped and aligned to accept and <b>transmit</b> large <b>loads</b> during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running). The tarsals of the midfoot, which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to <b>transmit</b> <b>loads</b> between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase. Conversely, the midfoot bones and joints also allow for the transmission of loads and inter-joint movement that unlocks the foot to create a loosely packed structure which renders the foot highly compliant over a variety of surfaces. In this configuration, the foot is able to absorb and damp the large loads encountered during heel strike and early weight acceptance. [...] The forefoot, with its long metatarsal and relatively long phalanges, <b>transmits</b> <b>loads</b> during the end-of-stance phase that facilitate the push-off and transfer of forward momentum.

40|$|After {{resection}} of the radial head, {{the load}} transmission through the forearm is changed dramatically. Most of the axial load is {{transmitted to the}} ulna. This can happen through the interosseous membrane, if intact, thus preventing proximal migration of theradius. However, radial head resection entails some slacking of the interosseous membrane, thereby reducing its ability to <b>transmit</b> <b>load.</b> In traumatic lesions of the interosseous membrane there is no limit to the proximal migration of the radius until the ulnar head abuts on the carpus. In both cases the load transmitted by the ulna increases dramatically and can promote fractures thereof. A 52 -year-old, right-handed male patient presented with a periprosthetic fracture of the right ulna 6 weeks after implantation of an ulna head prosthesis. He had previously undergone radial head excision for malunion of the radial head and secondary humeroradial osteoarthritis.

From the spectrum of possible treatment options, ulnar head resurfacing/hemiprosthesis was elected and performed without intraoperative or postoperative irregularities. However, 6 weeks postoperatively, as he was lifting a heavy object, a periprosthetic fracture of the ulna occurred, which ultimately was treated successfully by open reduction and plate fixation.
