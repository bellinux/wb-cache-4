5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|In September 1794 the Sardinians and Austrians {{advanced}} to Carcare, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the French link to Genoa, where supplies were obtained. Advised by his artillery chief Napoleon Bonaparte, Dumerbion struck back on 15 September. While Sérurier feinted at Vinadio {{on the left}} and Macquard feinted at Limone Piemonte in the center, Masséna mounted the main thrust on the right. In the First Battle of Dego on 21 September, 18,000 French troops beat Olivier, Count of Wallis and 8,000 Austro-Sardinians. Though the allies escaped encirclement, the French later seized the port of Vado Ligure. Dumerbion and Garnier both recommended Sérurier's promotion and he was nominated general of division on 22 December 1794. Given command of the right flank division in place of Masséna who was sick, his brigadiers were Barthélemy Catherine Joubert and Sextius Alexandre François de Miollis.|$|E
5|$|When the Chinese forces, {{numbering}} up to 1,000 and <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> {{supply lines}} to Semarang, arrived in Tanjung in April 1741, Visscher told the regent {{to deal with}} them; however, the regent's forces stalled, refusing to move until they received a tribute of high quality rice. After Yonko sent the rice, the regent's men went to Tanjung, stood with the rebels outside of their range, then fired and left. The rebels soon occupied a sugar mill there. In Grobogan, Mertopuro, armed with weapons from the Dutch military command, staged {{an attack on the}} Chinese rebels, in which the Javanese troops opened fire on the Chinese before the Dutch came. Once the Dutch arrived, Mertopuro showed bullet wounds in horses—inflicted by his own men—as proof that he had fought.|$|E

5|$|Dance formed his ships into a line {{of battle}} and ordered {{three or four of}} them to raise blue ensigns and the others red, giving the {{impression}} of a heavy escort by implying that the ships with blue ensigns were warships. This ruse provoked a cautious response from Linois, who ordered his squadron to shadow the convoy without closing with them. During the night, Dance held position and Linois remained at a distance, unsure of the strength of the British convoy. At 09:00, Dance reformed his force into sailing formation to put distance between the two forces and Linois took the opportunity to attack, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off the rearmost British ships. Dance tacked and his lead vessels came to the support of the rear, engaging Marengo at long range. Unnerved by the sudden British manoeuvere, Linois turned and retreated, convinced that the convoy was defended by an overwhelming force. Continuing the illusion that he was supported by warships, Dance ordered his ships to pursue Linois over the next two hours, eventually reforming and reaching the Straits of Malacca safely. There they were met several days later by two ships of the line sent from India.|$|E
5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E
5|$|The two {{combined}} battalions began {{digging in}} around Isurava. A headquarters {{had been set}} {{up at the top of}} the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group. Using a Bren gun he had taken from wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery and the rest of the group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that the undergrowth was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged straight at the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold {{one of six}} £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack by}} the 8th Brigade, {{consisting}} of the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment, the 47th Sikhs, the 59th Scinde Rifles and the 2/124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry, began at 04:45 towards the Wadi Ishkar, west of Jaljulye. The 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment at Ras el 'Ain and the 2/124th Baluchistan Infantry at Tell el Murkhmar, advanced rapidly capturing {{the first line of}} defence, between Bir Adas and the Hadrah road. A company from the Manchester Regiment advanced {{on both sides of the}} railway, eventually reaching a bridge over the Wadi Ishkar west of Jaljulye. Here, they fired on the village and railway redoubt with two machine guns, while the Baluchistan Infantry advanced to occupy Byar Adas at 07:15. At 09:10 the 47th Sikhs reinforced the attack on the Railway Redoubt, supported by an intense five-minute bombardment. Shortly afterwards, the redoubt, along with a pack gun and two machine guns, was captured by the Baluchistan Infantry. At 10:45 a bombardment covered the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment's attack on Jaljulye, which was easily captured after the Ottoman defenders had quickly withdrawn, in consequence of the advance by the 7th Brigade, 3rd (Lahore) Division, which was <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> them off. At 12:30 artillery fire from the IV Brigade RFA was directed on Hable, which was captured 30 minutes later; the 8th Brigade's advance was resumed at 13:30 towards Kh. Ras et Tire and Tell Manasif. Both objectives were reached about 18:00, the brigade bivouacking for the night behind strong outposts.|$|E

25|$|Wilson, French and Murray {{crossed to}} France on 14 August. Wilson was sceptical of the German {{invasion}} of Belgium, {{feeling that it}} would be diverted to meet the French thrusts into Lorraine and the Ardennes. Reconnoitring the area with Harper in August 1913, Wilson had wanted to deploy the BEF just east of Namur. Although Wilson's prediction of the German advance was less prescient than Kitchener's, had this been done, it is possible that Anglo-French forces could have attacked north, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off the German Armies moving westwards north of the Meuse.|$|E

25|$|On 11 July 1920, the {{government}} of Great Britain sent a telegram to the Soviets, signed by Curzon, which {{has been described as}} a de facto ultimatum. It requested that the Soviets halt their offensive at the Curzon line and accept it as a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations. In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On 17 July, the Bolsheviks refused and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off the ongoing trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.|$|E

25|$|Singapore has {{traditionally}} relied on water from Malaysia. However, this reliance has made Singapore {{subject to the}} possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as a political leverage by <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off supply. In order to reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974. However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand on the reservoirs for potable water.|$|E
25|$|Following her husband's death, Elizabeth made solemn vows to Konrad {{similar to}} those of a nun. These vows {{included}} celibacy, as well as complete obedience to Konrad as her confessor and spiritual director. Konrad's treatment of Elizabeth was extremely harsh, and he held her to standards of behavior which were almost impossible to meet. Among the punishments he is alleged to have ordered were physical beatings; he also ordered her to send away her three children. Her pledge to celibacy proved a hindrance to her family's political ambitions. Elizabeth was more or less held hostage at Pottenstein, the castle of her uncle, Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, in an effort to force her to remarry. Elizabeth, however, held fast to her vow, even <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off her own nose so that no man would find her attractive enough to marry.|$|E
25|$|In the Krivasoo swamp ten {{kilometres}} {{south of}} Narva, the Soviet 1078th Regiment and the ski battalion of the 314th Rifle Division crossed the river under a heavy German air and artillery attack in four hours. Despite {{the resistance of}} the 29th Estonian Police Battalion, the 314th Rifle Division approached the Auvere Railway Station 10 kilometres west of Narva, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the railway behind the III SS Panzer Corps and the two division-sized units of Army Group Narwa. The Soviet author Fyodor Paulman depicts the battles for Auvere station as ferocious, causing serious casualties to the 314th Rifle Division. Two regiments of the 125th Rifle Division were sent to assist them. The renewed Soviet units captured the railway crossing near Auvere station on 6 February, losing it on the same day under the fire of the German coastal artillery. From then on, the Soviet forces remained passive in the direction of Auvere, giving Army Group Narwa valuable time to regain their strength.|$|E

25|$|The next day, 27 July, at the Battle of Talavera the French {{advanced}} in three columns and were repulsed several times {{throughout the day}} by Wellesley, but at a heavy cost to the British force. In the aftermath Marshal Soult's army was discovered to be advancing south, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Wellesley off from Portugal. Wellesley moved east on 3 August to block it, leaving 1,500 wounded {{in the care of}} the Spanish, intending to confront Soult before finding out that the French were in fact 30,000 strong. The British commander sent the Light Brigade on a dash to hold the bridge over the Tagus River at Almaraz. With communications and supply from Lisbon secured for now, Wellesley considered joining with Cuesta again but found out that his Spanish ally had abandoned the British wounded to the French and was thoroughly uncooperative, promising and then refusing to supply the British forces, aggravating Wellesley and causing considerable friction between the British and their Spanish allies. The lack of supplies, coupled with the threat of French reinforcement (including the possible inclusion of Napoleon himself) in the spring, led to the British deciding to retreat into Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Unhappy with Hiller's {{inability}} to chase Eugène out of Italy, the Hofkriegsrat replaced him with Count Heinrich von Bellegarde. When Joachim Murat defected to the Coalition in January 1814, bringing {{the army of}} the Kingdom of Naples with him, Eugène abandoned the line of the Adige and fell back to the Mincio River. Hoping to secure a bridgehead across the Mincio, Bellegarde put his army in motion. On the same day, Eugène determined to drive back the Austrian outposts. These actions brought about the Battle of the Mincio River on 8 February 1814. The Franco-Italians won the battle while losing 3,000 killed and wounded and 500 captured out of 34,000 troops engaged. The Austrians suffered losses of 2,800 killed and wounded plus 1,200 men captured. Accompanied by Bellegarde, Radivojevich's right wing got across the Mincio at Borghetto near Valeggio and began to drive back Eugène's weak left wing under Jean-Antoine Verdier. Meanwhile, Eugène made his main effort on the right with Paul Grenier's reinforced corps. He and Grenier crossed the river and began rolling up the Austrian left wing after heavy fighting near Pozzolo. Though outnumbered three-to-one, Verdier's men proved unexpectedly tenacious and held out most of the day. When Eugène and Grenier approached Valeggio from the south, <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> them off from the east bank, Bellegarde and Radivojevich hastily withdrew their soldiers and conceded defeat. Undaunted, they tried to force a crossing two days later, but were repulsed again. Discouraged, Bellegarde never again tried to break the Mincio line during the campaign.|$|E
