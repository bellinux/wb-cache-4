5|$|Elizabeth {{gave birth}} to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent {{allowing}} her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince. A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main game, four self-contained stories were released as downloadable content (DLC) under the title , featuring new characters within the Muramasa universe. For the new characters, swords are replaced by other weapons such as clubs and shurikens, but <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> play {{in the same way}} as Momohime and Kisuke. New music was created for the title under Sakimoto's supervision: the four episodes were scored by Kudo, Chiba, Kaneda and Iwata respectively. The Vanillaware-developed DLC launched in both Japan and the West between November 2013 and November 2014: the final DLC's Japanese release was delayed by over two months behind the Western release. A special edition of Muramasa Rebirth exclusive to Japan contained all four DLC episodes alongside the original content.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E

25|$|<b>They</b> <b>otherwise</b> hold very {{different}} {{views on the}} succession, chronology and identity of Neferneferuaten. (the public and the internet still often commingle the two unwittingly and otherwise).

25|$|Under {{the current}} Laws, a captain may forfeit either of his side's innings. A {{forfeited}} innings shall {{be considered as}} a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other how to set up the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result. Winning a game gains a team considerably more points than drawing it, so captains are often willing to risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win that <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> would not have had {{as long as they are}} getting a similar opportunity in return.|$|E

25|$|This is {{analogous}} to a human throwing an arrow by hand versus using a bow; the use of elastic storage (the bow) allows the muscles to operate closer to isometric on the force-velocity curve. This enables the muscles to do work over a longer time and thus produce more energy than <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> could, while the elastic element releases that work faster than the muscles can. The use of elastic energy storage {{has been found in}} jumping mammals as well as in frogs, with commensurate increases in power ranging from two to seven times that of equivalent muscle mass.|$|E
25|$|Rocket League {{was officially}} {{announced}} as {{the sequel to}} Battle-Cars in February 2014. Building on the effects {{from the lack of}} marketing with Battle-Cars, Psyonix developed a different marketing approach to Rocket League. This included engaging with YouTube and Twitch.tv video game streamers with early release copies to help spread the word, recognizing that clips from the game would be readily shared through social media. They also opened the game to early alpha and beta testing for several months following the game's announcement. Davis noted that <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> did not spend any money on traditional marketing approaches.|$|E
25|$|The project allowed Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis {{to explore}} {{some aspects of}} the {{original}} films that <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> {{had not been able to}} in the past, such as the history of the Librarian ghost, and pursue some of the ideas left out of the original script, including the appearance of Ivo Shandor as Gozer, who was intended to appear in the finale of the film as the ghost of a man in a business suit. Other concepts used in the game, such as the alternate dimensions that open up during the latter half of the game, are based on the original Ghostbusters 3 concept Hellbent which was in development hell during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Nutrient bioextraction is {{bioremediation}} involving cultured {{plants and}} animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is {{the practice of}} farming and harvesting shellfish and seaweed {{for the purpose of}} removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies. It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> would incur. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries. Additionally, studies have demonstrated seaweed's potential to improve nitrogen levels.|$|E
25|$|Males {{within a}} group have a {{dominance}} hierarchy, with one male having alpha status. The dominance status of male macaques usually changes when a former alpha male leaves or dies. Other {{ways in which}} status changes is when an alpha male loses his rank or when a troop splits, leaving a new alpha position open. The longer a male is in a troop, the higher his status is likely to be. Females also exist in a stable dominance hierarchy, and a female's rank depends on her mother. Younger females tend to rank higher than their older siblings. Higher-ranking matrilines have greater social cohesion. Strong relationships with dominant females can allow dominant males to retain their rank when <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> would not.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E

25|$|Larger chains {{have felt}} the impact of {{discount}} retailers, with some customers switching from larger supermarket retailers for everyday necessities. To entice customers into their stores from larger supermarket chains, Poundland advertise familiar brands at competitive prices, with the hope customers may then be inclined to impulse buy other products such as own-brand that <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> wouldn't have purchased. Asda reduced some branded product prices such as Colgate toothpaste to £1 in January 2009, in competition with Poundland who offered the same products at the £1 price; in response, Poundland introduced multi-buy offers to provide a larger quantity of the products for the same price. However, research conducted by The Grocer magazine in August 2009 found that of the 1300-odd supposedly discounted ASDA products, a third were the same price as in March 2008 and 173 products had been selling for less than £1 during Spring 2009.|$|E
25|$|Later, Cherion and {{a company}} called Steam Frontier plan to redevelop Harlem and Cheiron organizes a mock trial {{involving}} Shinjiro and Carlos, {{a member of a}} local biker gang called the Centaurs, to evict the people of Harlem. Cherion and Steam Frontier lose the trial and Cheiron is revealed to be {{a former member of the}} Centaurs, and realizes her feelings for Harlem's citizens. Soon after, the city is attacked by Kokuryu, a self-proclaimed princess who wants to destroy the city. After killing Kokuryu to save Harlem, Shinjiro encounters Rosarita Aries, a bounty hunter from Mexico, and she joins the Star Division. As a perfectionist, she becomes devastated when Shinjiro is injured after an attack but learns that everyone makes mistakes as <b>they</b> <b>otherwise</b> cannot grow. After successfully repelling an attack by Dokurobo, a demon commander, Rosarita establishes herself as a member of the Star Division.|$|E
25|$|The MCC touring team left Tilbury Docks on the S.S. Stratheden amidst {{calls to}} cancel the Ashes tour because of the {{weakness}} of the team led by Freddie Brown. Such critics were, of course, ignored and the team traveled in first-class luxury on the P liner. Though it took several weeks for them to reach Fremantle in Western Australia this method avoided jet lag and allowed the team to relax and get to know each other. The teenager Brian Close had been excused from National Service in the British Army and was particularly active in exploring the whole ship from top to bottom. Apart from the normal deck exercises some of the MCC players formed a short lived band and Godfrey Evans gave his well-known impression of Carmen Miranda in the fancy dress party. They stopped in Ceylon for a one-day game which was drawn, but saw Arthur Macintyre make 104 and Len Hutton damage one of his fingers. <b>They</b> <b>otherwise</b> arrived safely and found that steak and fried eggs were regularly served in Australian hotels (virtually unobtainable in ration-bound Britain) and soon put on weight.|$|E
