He was quoted in 1950 remarking, [...] "If you say why not bomb [...] <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>I</b> say, why not today? If you say today at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock?" ...|$|E

[...] On 30 June, Del Piero wrote an open letter to the Juventus fans thanking them for almost two decades of support, stating, [...] "Above all what remains is the fans, you who are Juventus. That jersey that I loved and will always love, that I desired and respected... From <b>tomorrow</b> <b>I</b> will no longer be a Juventus player, but I will always be one of you. Now a new {{adventure}} begins and I am as fired up as I was 19 summers ago." ...|$|E

500|$|Emily Estep of WeGotThisCovered.com {{ranked the}} episode [...] 5 on her [...] "Top 10 Episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants" [...] list. She said [...] "While Rock Bottom {{is mostly a}} goofy episode, it's {{also one of the}} scarier episodes of SpongeBob." [...] She also said the episode has [...] "the ideal balance of cuteness and sheer terror – like SpongeBob running from a mysterious character, saying, 'Well, that place will be there <b>tomorrow.</b> <b>I</b> guess I'd better keep walking. Running. Better start running. Running. Sprinting! Yes, I just gotta keep sprinting!' (Before he hits a wall; 'Sitting, sitting, bleeding.')" [...] that made the episode [...] "so well-remembered." [...] Bill Treadway of DVD Talk gave the episode a 3 out of 5 rating.|$|E
500|$|Gleeson was an {{advisor to}} men {{of all faiths}} in the {{regiment}} and kept careful records of their names and addresses {{so that he could}} write to the families of those that died. He ended each letter with the words [...] "They paid a great sacrifice", which was later used as the title of a book published in 2010 that details the wartime service records of men from Cork. [...] Much of his time was spent answering letters from families in Ireland concerned about the wellbeing of their sons and husbands. [...] At times the task almost overwhelmed him and this is evident in his personal diary when he wrote, in June 1915, [...] "I got 12 letters today; just after reading them. What answering they will take <b>tomorrow.</b> <b>I</b> like to give these poor people all the solace I can, anyhow, but still there’s no limit to the sorrowing inquiries. The tragedy of these letters".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{perceived}} adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, {{especially those}} {{with whom she had}} once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: [...] "My dear you are ugly, but <b>tomorrow</b> <b>I</b> shall be sober and you will still be ugly"—or similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. According to the columnist Simon Hoggart, similar stories involving other figures had been circulating for years; he concluded: [...] "If it sounds true, if it echoes something we feel about the politician, then it will cling to him or her as if bonded with superglue".|$|E

500|$|Nelson {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} battle, repeating a sentiment he had expressed {{at the battle}} of Cape St Vincent that [...] "Before this time <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>I</b> shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey." [...] It was late by the time the British arrived and the French, anchored in a strong position with a combined firepower greater than that of Nelson's fleet, did not expect them to attack. Nelson however immediately ordered his ships to advance. The French line was anchored close to a line of shoals, in the belief that this would secure their port side from attack; Brueys had assumed the British would follow convention and attack his centre from the starboard side. However, Captain Thomas Foley aboard [...] discovered a gap between the shoals and the French ships, and took Goliath into the channel. The unprepared French found themselves attacked on both sides, the British fleet splitting, with some following Foley and others passing down the starboard side of the French line.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>I</b> have a really bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{ordered the}} fleet {{to slow down}} at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig [...] "springs" [...] on their anchor cables, a system of {{attaching}} the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under raking fire. Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria, was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive Orient would be fighting against three. The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division {{would be unable to}} join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line. To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their mizzen mast and [...] hoist an illuminated White Ensign, which was different enough from the French tricolour {{that it would not be}} mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness. As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with Vanguards officers, announcing as he rose: [...] "Before this time <b>tomorrow</b> <b>I</b> shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey," [...] in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.|$|E
