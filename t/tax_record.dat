500|$|Modern written {{use of the}} toponym Trachones appears {{right before}} the Greek Revolution in an 1820 <b>tax</b> <b>record</b> of villages in Attica, while its location, {{corresponding}} {{to the area of}} Euonymeia, is revealed in 19th century maps, including John Thomson's 1814 map of Attica (therein labeled as Traconi), and an 1881 map from the German Archeological Institute. During the preceding years, the Trachones Estate, corresponding to a large part of what is now South Athens, was sold to Mufti Hamza, an 18th-century Muslim religious leader of Athens. Records show that the feudal estate had a small population of landless farmers, and that ownership passed on through the Mufti's progeny. In 1912, the settlement of Trachones was incorporated into the Municipality of Athens, while the land of the estate was sold in 1918 by the Greek State to the Geroulanou family for 680.000 drachma. In 1952, {{a large part of the}} estate was converted from farm to urban plots, including land for the creation of the Hellenicon Airport. This led to a rapid urbanization following the expanding urban sprawl of the Greek capital, and to the establishment of the current residential community. In 1968 the modern Municipality of Alimos was established, administratively linking the community of Trachones with the coastal community of Kalamaki [...] to the West, giving rise to the term Ano Kalamaki (upper Kalamaki) to refer to the area of Euonymeia.|$|E
