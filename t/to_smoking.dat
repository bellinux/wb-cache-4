40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the predictors of the willingness <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> among a cohort of male Saudi students. MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to a cohort of male students that were recruited from three institutes of higher education. Using the retrieved data, bivariate analysis and logistic regression tests were performed to assess the factors associated with the willingness <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking.</b> ResultsOf 467 participants, 24 % of respondents were current smokers, while 65 % of these smokers were willing <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking.</b> In the bivariate analysis, past attempts <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> and the anti-smoking messages on TV and in newspapers were significantly associated with the willingness <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking.</b> Only one variable – past attempts <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> – was a significant predictor of the willingness <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking,</b> as shown by the multivariate logistic regression analysis. ConclusionThe findings of this study indicate that Saudi male students who smoke are willing to quit smoking; having unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> in the past, they are willing to try again. Successful programs should be developed for male university students in KSA to assist them in their quest <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> and maintain cessation...|$|R

Due to the various negative health effects of smoking, nicotine dependence contributes to the high mortality in this patient group. The purpose of the current study was to investigate Swiss methadone and buprenorphine-maintained patients' willingness <b>to</b> stop <b>smoking</b> and <b>to</b> clarify further <b>smoking</b> cessation procedures. Methods Substance abuse history, nicotine dependence, and readiness <b>to</b> stop <b>smoking</b> were assessed in a sample of 103 opiate-dependent patients in the metropolitan area of Zurich, Switzerland. Patients were asked <b>to</b> document their <b>smoking</b> patterns and readiness to quit. Results Only a small number of patients were willing <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> cigarettes (10. 7 %) and, even though bupropione or nicotine replacement therapy was included in the fixed daily treatment care, only one patient received nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. A diagnosis of depression in patients' clinical records was associated with readiness <b>to</b> stop <b>smoking.</b> No significant associations were found between readiness <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> and age, methadone treatment characteristics, and presence of co-dependencies.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Susceptibility <b>to</b> {{cigarette}} <b>smoking,</b> {{defined as}} {{the lack of a}} firm decision against smoking, is a strong predictor of regular smoking and addiction. Several modifiable risk factors have been identified among never cigarette smokers, and one potential factor of interest is waterpipe use. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the association of waterpipe use with susceptibility <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> among never-smoking youth. METHODS: In a pooled analysis of 17 Arab nations with nationally representative Global Youth Tobacco Surveys conducted during 2002 - 2011, tobacco-related information was obtained from 30, 711 never-smoking adolescents representing 4, 962, 872 youth. Study outcome was susceptibility <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoking,</b> and primary exposure was waterpipe use. Data were analyzed in 2014 using weighted logistic regression models, including stratified models by gender, to determine the odds of susceptibility <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> with waterpipe use, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 20 % of never-smoking youth were susceptible <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoking,</b> ranging from 13. 1 % in Oman to 32. 6 % in Somalia; 5. 2 % currently used waterpipe, ranging from 0. 3 % in Morocco to 23. 5 % in Kuwait. The estimated odds of susceptibility <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> were 2. 5 (95 % CI= 1. 9, 3. 4) times higher for adolescents who used waterpipe in the past month compared with those who did not, controlling for confounders. Estimates were similar when stratified by gender. CONCLUSIONS: Waterpipe use is associated with susceptibility <b>to</b> cigarette <b>smoking.</b> Study findings identify a novel risk factor for never smokers <b>to</b> initiate <b>smoking</b> and will help the public health community develop and implement policies around waterpipe use prevention...|$|R

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{study examined the}} relationships between household smoking restrictions and intentions <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> among Korean American male smokers in California. We used data from the California Korean American Tobacco Use Survey (CKATUS), which was conducted in 2004 using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Among the 2, 545 respondents {{who participated in the}} CKA-TUS, the 387 male smokers who answered a question assessing their intention <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> were included in the final analyses. In univariable analyses, smokers who reported having household smoking restrictions were more likely to intend <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> as compared with those who did not (P< 0. 01). Other independent correlates of having an intention <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> were being less than 50 yr of age, having spent more than 50 % of one’s life in the US, being assimilated, and having other smokers in the household. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant correlates of having an intention <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> were household smoking restrictions (complete or partial restriction vs. no restriction on smoking; odds ratio, 2. 54; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 22 - 5. 28) and absence of other smokers in the household.

40|$|Abstract Background Programs to {{encourage}} smokers <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> tobacco {{have been implemented}} worldwide and are generally viewed as an effective public health intervention program. However, {{few studies have examined}} the social factors that influence a smoker’s intention <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking.</b> This study investigated the socio-contextual factors that are associated with the intention <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> among male smokers in South Korea. Methods Data were obtained from a 2014 nationally representative panel that examined the influences of mass media on the health of the Korean population. Members of this panel were recruited using a mixed-method sampling and a combination of random digit dial and address-based sampling designs. Survey questions were based on those used in previous studies that assessed the effects of social context, including mass media and social capital, on health. Multivariate logistic regression analyses of the answers of 313 male smokers were undertaken. Results Male smokers who participated in community-based activities were 2. 45 times more likely to intend <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> compared <b>to</b> male smokers in general (95  % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 25 – 6. 82). In addition, male smokers who participated in informal social gathering networks were 2. 38 times more likely to intend <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> compared <b>to</b> male smokers in general (95  % CI: 1. 11 – 5. 10). Moreover, male smokers with high smartphone use were 1. 93 times more likely than smokers with low smartphone use to intend <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> within one year (95  % CI: 1. 07 – 3. 46). Conclusions A supportive environment that enables male smokers to access beneficial health information and that encourages them <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking</b> is necessary for a stop-smoking program to be effective. The result of this study contribute to establishing a new smoking control policy by identifying socio-contextual factors related to the intention <b>to</b> quit <b>smoking...</b>|$|R
