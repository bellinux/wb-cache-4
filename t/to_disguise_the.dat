5|$|On Friday 16 November 2001, {{two months}} after the show had {{finished}} forever, parts of the old Live & Kicking set from Series 8 were resurrected and reused as part of BBC Scotland's regional studio set for BBC Children in Need. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> set's former use, all traces of L branding were removed and replaced with Children In Need logos and throughout the course of the evening, the old gunge tank, beanbag seating area and performance stage were reused one more time'.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham was a {{military}} deception employed by the Allies during the Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic deception designed <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> imminent Allied invasion of Normandy. Graffham provided political support to the visual and wireless deception of Operation Fortitude North. These operations together created a fictional threat to Norway {{during the summer of}} 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang {{had to be}} altered in post-production {{as it had been}} filmed against black velvet cloth, <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind. Jim Henson was unhappy with the compositing of the finished scene, although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy of inclusion.|$|E

5|$|Major Danuta Ślązak of the Home Army, hid {{out with}} a group of wounded {{patients}} whom she had saved from a hospital that had been set on fire by the Germans during {{the last days of the}} uprising. After the war she wrote a book about her experiences, Byłam Warszawskim Robinsonem (I was a Warsaw Robinson). A portion of her group left the hiding place after German troops called out for them to surrender and were immediately executed. The rest remained hidden and escaped detection. Eventually they used the corpses of their murdered companions <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> entry to their hiding place.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the security breach {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, {{a reference to the}} flags' earlier use <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> successful breach by the real motorcade. Police {{had no choice but to}} release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.|$|E

5|$|Prominent {{families}} {{throughout the}} world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of Henry VIII survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, and his two daughters: Mary I of England in 1527 and Elizabeth I of England in 1562 (as an adult she would often try <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E

40|$|The {{patient in}} {{psychotherapy}} often communicates <b>disguised</b> impressions of <b>the</b> therapist. Certain mechanisms, such as displacement from the therapist to other persons and situations or identification with <b>the</b> therapist, contribute <b>to</b> <b>disguising</b> <b>the</b> communication. Among patients’ manifest stories about relationships, those selected by two independent raters as latent communications about the therapist contained more negative aspects and destructive interactions than those not selected. In the nonselected stories {{the patient and}} his or her relationships were portrayed more positively. This may be a clue as to how therapists make assessments of whether latent content about the therapist is present. They may view it as more likely to be present if the patient speaks of negative feelings in relationships...|$|R

5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally {{on behalf of the}} Egyptian government, with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge <b>to</b> <b>disguise</b> <b>the</b> true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E

40|$|Kantian {{aesthetic}} discourse seems built {{exclusively on}} this {{exclusion of the}} personal and the economical to ensure the collective-ness and universality of the judgment made by the aesthetic subject, even though the discourse clearly celebrates the genius, the free expressive self. My thesis focuses on the excluded "interest" in the Kantian aesthetic judgment. For me, there is something behind the insistence of disinterestedness" of the aesthetic judgment. External forces symbolized by the term-interest-seem to be an annoying part of the aesthetic. They have to be exorcised. The purgation of "interest" has to be incessant {{so much so that}} what interest symbolizes, i. e. the economical, seems to be the essential part of aesthetic discourse. The thesis of this report is the Kantian aesthetics is an ideological mask that tries <b>to</b> <b>disguises</b> <b>the</b> uneasiness, the anxiety in the conflicts between cultural forces and economic forces.
