40|$|What makes {{a problem}} hard to compute, {{and how does}} one {{categorize}} problems that accurately captures this notion of hardness? Computer science has traditionally approached this issue with two classification schemas: resource-bounded complex-ity classes (deterministic or nondeterministic time and space bound computations) and bounded reducibilities (≤ p m and ≤ p T reductions). We show that neither of these approaches accurately capture the phenomena of being “hard to compute” The development of complexity classes has blurred <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> and complexity. That a function (or the sets characterized by them) cannot be computed in time t does not imply it always requires more than time t, but only that it sometimes does. So nonmembership in a complexity class only implies infinitely often (i. o.) complexity. From this view, classification of problems by complexity classes is a classification of problems that are almost-everywhere easy. Here we study problems that require more than time t for all but {{a finite number of}} inputs, that is, problems that are almost-everywhere (a. e.) complex.

40|$|In {{this article}} I propose that creoles are {{relatively}} transparent {{compared to their}} source languages. This means that they display more one-to-one relations between meaning and form. Transparency should be distinguished from <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>simplicity,</b> ease <b>of</b> acquisition, and regularity. Definitions of these notions are given and it is shown how they have been mixed up in earlier literature. The transparency of creoles is explained {{as a result of}} language contact. When people speaking radically different languages communicate, they tend to use maximally intelligible forms, i. e. transparent forms. The repeated selection of transparent over opaque forms will lead to the formation of a relatively transparent language. Hence, creoles are predicted to be either as transparent as or more transparent than their source languages. An empirical study is performed to test this prediction. The transparency of four contact languages and their sub- and superstrates is measured by checking them on a list of non-transparent features. It turns out that they all exhibit opaque structures, but that there is a striking absence of so called form-based forms: linguistic elements and rules that are not motivated pragmatically or semantically. This indicates that such ‘empty’ forms are lost during intense language contact...|$|R

40|$|In a world {{progressively}} {{suffering from}} information overload, simplicity in information design becomes a quality <b>of</b> increasing relevance. <b>Simplicity</b> in visual data presentations creates clarity that facilitates good decision-making. In decision-making, as elsewhere, we can’t make a silk purse of a sow’s ear. Mediocre visual data presentations have three unwanted effects. They cause decision makers {{to use more}} time than necessary digesting the information on hand, they hinder decision makers to understand problems and evaluate possible decisions, and they inspire decision makers to neglect available information in favour <b>of</b> unfounded guesswork. <b>Simplicity</b> in information design fights all three undesired effects. The simplicity in demand is functional simplicity. Functional simplicity in information design is concerned with improving usability and utility of information {{and should not be}} confused with minimalism, which is a matter <b>of</b> aesthetics. Functional <b>simplicity</b> in information design means more understanding with less reading. That in turn leads to more effective and more efficient decision-making. Functional simplicity in information design goes beyond raw reduction of data presentations. It involves size, variation/repetition, and structure. All three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> influence the amount of redundancy that creates the delicate balance between necessity and superfluity, between understanding and boredom. The measure of redundancy that is both necessary and sufficient should be determined with a view to the context and the expected culture of the intended target groups.

40|$|The term {{voluntary}} simplicity {{is attributed}} to the social reformer Richard B. Gregg, who in 1936 wrote an influential pamphlet in favour of the conscious and deliberate simplification and repurposing of life, {{to the benefit of}} both the individual and society at large. He {{is by no means the}} first exponent of this line of thought, nor will he turn out to be the last. By the late 1970 s a loosely-bound cultural movement seems to have had emerged around the idea, and today there are Simplicity collectives, work-shops, institutes and lecture series in several countries. <b>The</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> deliberate <b>simplicity</b> is tangled up in a complicated web of countercultural sentiments and beliefs: It was understood by Romantics and Transcendentalists as a prerequisite for the attainment of the divine truths and inspirations imbedded in Nature. It was advocated by Victorian aesthetic socialists as the starting-point of a true levelling of society, liberating the human instinct for craftsmanship, beauty, virtue and social justice. It was utilised by Gandhi to imagine a future India, free, not only from its colonial shackles but also from the violence and tensions of industrial progress and competition, which he saw as a negation of the Indian soul and key values, and by his contemporary Ralph Borsodi as a way for Americans to become truly independent, both from government forces and predatory capitalists. It was promoted by futurist Duane Elgin in the 70 s for its promise of individual and planetary revitalization, and still has strong adherents in our own century, who often emphasise family values and reclaiming personal agency in an age of rampant materialism and have referred to it as the poetic alternative to consumer culture.

40|$|Abstract Constructing an {{appropriate}} {{model is a}} crucial step in performing the reasoning required to successfully answer a query about {{the behavior of a}} physical situation. In the compositional modeling approach [5], a system is provided with a library of composable pieces of knowledge about the physical world called model fragments. The model construction problem involves selecting appropriate model fragments to describe the situation. Model construction can be considered either for static analysis of a single state or for simulation of dynamic behavior over a sequence of states. The latter is significantly more difficult than the former since one must select model fragments without knowing exactly what will happen in the future states. The model construction problem in general can advantageously be formulated as a problem of reasoning about relevance of knowledge that is available to the system using a general framework for reasoning about relevance described in [19, 14]. In this paper, we present a model formulation procedure based on that framework for selecting model fragments efficiently for the case of simulation. For such an algorithm to be useful, the generated model must be adequate for answering the given query and, at the same time, as simple as possible. We define formally <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> adequacy and <b>simplicity</b> and show that the algorithm in fact generates an adequate and simplest model. ...|$|R
