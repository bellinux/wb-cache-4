50|$|Tuvuki {{effectively}} retired at {{the general}} election held on 6-13 May 2006. He did in fact contest the election, but made only a <b>token</b> <b>bid</b> to retain his seat, as the SDL had selected Ratu Josefa Dimuri as its main candidate. Dimuri was duly elected.|$|R
50|$|The Fiji Village {{news service}} {{announced}} on 21 March 2006 that the SDL {{had decided not}} to nominate Nacuva for another Parliamentary term. He would therefore retire at the general election to be held on 6-13 May, though he did in fact make a <b>token</b> <b>bid</b> for another constituency, mainly to raise his party's profile. Following the election, he was elected unopposed on 5 June to succeed Ratu Epeli Nailatikau as Parliamentary Speaker, a position from which incumbent members were constitutionally barred.|$|R
50|$|In {{his party}} role, he worked aggressively to {{consolidate}} his party's support among indigenous Fijians, while attempting with little success to make inroads into the Indo-Fijian electorate. At the previous election held in 2001, the SDL received barely {{one percent of}} the vote in the seven contested communal constituencies reserved for citizens of Indian descent, a figure that only marginally improved in 2006. He also made a <b>token</b> <b>bid</b> for the Ba Open Constituency for the SDL, but garnered only 60 votes. On 15 June 2006, Baba announced his resignation from his party post.|$|R
40|$|This is an {{investigation}} into the design of a market-based process to replace NASA's current committee process for allocating Shuttle secondary payload resources (lockers, Watts and crew). The market-based process allocates budgets of tokens to NASA internal organizations that in turn use the budget to bid for priority for their middeck payloads. The scheduling algorithm selects payloads by priority class and maximizes the number of <b>tokens</b> <b>bid</b> to determine a manifest. The results of a number of controlled experiments show that such a system tends to allocate resources more efficiently by guiding participants to make resource and payload tradeoffs. Most participants were able to improve their position over NASA's current ranking system. Furthermore, those that are better off make large improvements while the few that do worse have relatively small losses. 2 I...|$|R
5000|$|Every auction {{is linked}} to a price and timer. Each placed <b>token</b> (<b>bid)</b> raises {{the value of the}} {{auctioned}} item by $0.01 (all auctions start at $0.00). If a user submits a token within the last 20 seconds of the auction when there is an existing bid, an additional 20 seconds will be added to the clock. The auction closes when the timer reads [...] "ENDED," [...] and there is no counterbidder. A hypothetical example of total cost to the bidder: a $99 Apple TV sold on Sixjax for $0.14, won with a bid of one tokenysthe winner paid $0.54 cents (1 Token Spent @ $0.40 + $0.14 Final auction price) plus shipping. Revenue is derived from the sale of token packages, modified by many token giveaways and promotions.|$|R
50|$|Ra is {{an auction}} game, where {{the players are}} all {{competing}} for the same resources. The game is played in three rounds, called Epochs, reflecting the history of ancient Egypt. Players use their sun <b>tokens</b> to <b>bid</b> against each other on auctions for tiles. At {{the end of an}} epoch, points will be scored for the number and types of tiles a player managed to win. The price of the tiles is determined by the players bidding for them, and values can shift rapidly.|$|R
50|$|A {{simple way}} to keep score, and to gamble in tarot, {{utilizes}} a number of poker chips or similar <b>tokens.</b> The <b>bid</b> levels correspond to 1, 2, 4, and 6/8 chips or units. Each player bids or raises by {{increasing the number of}} chips, similar to Poker but without the option of folding. Each player's wager remains in front of him, and the taker adds an extra matching stack for each defender. If the taker wins, he gets all the chips on the table. If the taker loses, the defenders divide the chips evenly.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{presently}} [writes Cartier] {{came the}} women again, [...] every one bringing a four-square mat {{in the manner}} of [...] carpets, and spreading them abroad in that place, they [...] caused us to sit upon them. This done the lord and king [...] of the country was brought upon nine or ten men's [...] shoulders (whom in their tongue they call Agouhanna), [...] sitting upon a great stag's skin, and they laid him down [...] upon the foresaid mats near to the captain, every one [...] beckoning unto us that he was their lord and king. This [...] Agouhanna was a man about fifty pears old. He was no [...] whit better apparelled than any of the rest, only excepted [...] that he had a certain thing made of hedgehogs [porcupines], [...] like a red wreath, and that was instead of his crown. [...] He was full of the palsy, and his members shrunk together. [...] After he had with certain signs saluted our captain and [...] all his company, and by manifest <b>tokens</b> <b>bid</b> all welcome, [...] he showed his legs and arms to our captain, and with [...] signs desired him to touch them, and so we did, rubbing [...] them with his own hands; then did Agouhanna take the [...] wreath or crown he had about his head, and gave it unto [...] our captain That done, they brought before him divers [...] diseased men, some blind, some crippled, some lame, and [...] some so old that the hair of their eyelids came down [...] and covered their cheeks, and laid them all along before [...] our captain to the end that they might of him be touched. [...] For it seemed unto them that God was descended and come [...] down from heaven to heal them.|$|R
50|$|To {{partake in}} auctions, users are {{required}} to buy a package of tokens. The offer on each package ranges from 40 to 1000 tokens, {{depending on whether the}} package is bought as a one-time purchase or via subscription. Based on these two modes of buying, tokens are priced from US$0.40 to $0.5. Every <b>token</b> provides one <b>bid</b> that a user can place in an auction. Therefore, each token counts as one unit per engagement with the site.|$|R
5000|$|Pantheon and Other Roleplaying Games {{included}} {{a total of}} five different competitive storytelling games - or five different scenarios, as they all use the same [...] "NarrativeCage Match TM" [...] system. In these games players have characters with which they engage in storytelling. On his turn, a player tells one sentence of a story, during which he must mention his character. Players can challenge sentences using a combination of die-rolling and bidding. When everyone has run out of <b>bidding</b> <b>tokens,</b> players wrap up the story and then see who earned points based on a score sheet.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve its efficiency, the {{researcher}} proposed a new anonymous auction protocol (Chang and Chang, 2006, [2]), which is called C-C Protocol now. According to C-C Protocol, the negotiation of session key and authentication are integrated in the initiation phase, so the efficiency enhance greatly. For the purpose of achieving anonymous auctions, the auctioneer designates a token to the bidders in the initiation phase and the bidders use the <b>token</b> to <b>bid</b> in the auction activity. However, in the initiation phase of C-C Protocol, there are no protect mechanism of bidder's identity, obviously. Once a lawless person participates in the auction activity, after knowing the bidder’s identity, the honest bidders will be threatened, because the lawless person will try his best to win the bid at a lower price. It could make some bidder refuse to bid to avoid damage. In such cases, any honest bidder is unable to bid in the security and equity situation. In view of such crisis, we propose an efficient and anonymous auction protocol. In this initiation phase and auction phase of protocol, all bidders needn't expose the identity in the communication with auctioneer; thus, all bidders can bid in the anonymous situation. Recently, the researcher proposed a “Deniabl...|$|R
6000|$|The gate {{opened and}} a body-servant {{appeared}} announcing {{that one of the}} great captains with some of his officers waited to see the king. Cetewayo made a sign, whereon the servant called out something, and they entered, three or four of them, saluting loudly. Seeing me they stopped and stared, whereon Cetewayo shortly, but with much clearness, repeated to them and to an induna who accompanied them, what he had already said to me, namely that I was his guest, sent for by him that he might use me as a messenger if he thought fit. He added that the man who dared to speak a word against me, or even to look at me askance, should pay the price with his life, however high his station, and he commanded that the heralds should proclaim this his decree throughout Ulundi and the neighbouring kraals. Then {{he held out his hand}} to me in <b>token</b> of friendship, <b>bidding</b> me to [...] "go softly" [...] and come to see him whenever I wished, and dismissed me in charge of the induna, one of the captains and some soldiers.|$|R
