5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right.

5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, <b>the</b> <b>active</b> site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains that make up <b>the</b> <b>active</b> site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters <b>the</b> <b>active</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>active</b> site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, {{at which point the}} final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from <b>the</b> <b>active</b> site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment.

40|$|Non-finite verb {{forms are}} ideal as {{indicators}} of a translator 2 ̆ 7 s ability and style of translating Latin into OE.
