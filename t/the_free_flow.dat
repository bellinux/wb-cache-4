For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows.

25|$|Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) {{have been}} agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN nation after the AEC goes into effect on 31 December 2015.

25|$|When a brilliantly timed naval {{attack on}} Soviet bomber bases with submarine-launched cruise missiles, with a strike force that {{includes}} the USS Chicago, cripples the Soviet bomber force, the Soviets lose their most effective convoy and fleet-killing weapon. The U.S. Marines {{take this opportunity to}} stage an amphibious assault on Iceland backed by the NATO navies, retaking the island and closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. A failed bomber raid on the NATO naval forces attacking Iceland (in which the remaining Soviet naval cruise missile bomber fleets are nearly wiped out) essentially means victory in the Atlantic, opening the USSR to direct attacks from carrier strike groups against its northern strategic areas and <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of convoys across the Atlantic. The Soviet occupation force is soon forced to unconditionally surrender, ending the threat of air raids on convoys. Simultaneously with the reversal in the Atlantic, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, a renowned poker player, makes an audacious gamble {{in the face of a}} final Soviet offensive that pushes NATO ground forces to the breaking point, launching an unexpected flanking manoeuvre that places heavy NATO forces in the rear of the Soviet spearhead, cutting off their last Category A regular army units behind the Leine River and interdicting their supplies. Intelligence gained from a prisoner on Iceland finally reveals the dire fuel situation in the USSR to NATO, which changes bombing priorities to wipe out the Red Army's forward fuel depots, essentially immobilizing the Soviet formations. Due to intense political pressure from Moscow to maintain an offensive into the Ruhr, the CINC-West refuses to allow Alekseyev to transfer his Category A troops east to close the salient. With the Soviet advance decisively halted, NATO catches its breath and prepares to move into a general offensive against the increasingly ineffective Soviet Category C reserves now being moved forward. At this time, Chairman Kosov confronts Minister Sergetov, and informs him that a power struggle is underway at the KGB between himself and a faction lead by the younger Jozef Larionov that has been favoured by the Politburo. At the next meeting, Sergetov pressures the Politburo into promoting Alekseyev to CINC-West, while his former superior is executed at Lefortovo Prison. Now forced to take direct orders from the Politburo, Alekseyev finds himself unable to secure a victory, and the NATO counteroffensive begins.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue is a {{phenomenon}} that can occur when a structure is exposed for repeated loads dur-ing a long time. This is {{what has happened in}} the Vårby Bridge south of Stockholm. The bridge, which was erected in 1996, was just after ten years during an inspection detected to have cracks in the weld between the stiffener and the flanges. This lead to an extensive inves-tigation to be able to describe what was the cause. Because of the great measurement a lot of data about the traffic flow and their effect on the bridge was obtained. That raised an idea of comparing the fatigue models in Eurocode against a real case. The question that was of in-terest was how well the Eurocode models actually were compare to the real measurements, how they relate to each other and how they relate to a fictitious real vehicle. The intermediate values for Nobs is showing that there is quite large differences. Therefore they should be used. The model should be a straight line instead of the “stair model” that is used today so the fatigue is designed on the safe side rather than the unsafe side which it is today in the upper part of the span. The results show that the bridge is able to handle <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> traffic that it is exposed for. At the simulation of FLM 3 together with DEM the result shows a life length that is satisfactory with the recommendations in Eurocode. The ratio between the equivalent stress range for FLM 3 and <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> traffic was 89 percent. The ratio between FLM 4 and <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> traffic gave that the traffic was 22 percent higher when the equivalent stress ranges was compared. The comparison between FLM 3 and FLM 4 was made with ÅDTt from <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> traffic. This gave a ratio of 73 percent between the models, with FLM 4 as the lower one. The fictitious real vehicle of 25, 25 meters didn’t give any critical results, but was higher than the fatigue limit. What could be seen was that the actual contribution from vehicles of the same amplitude that the simulations gave is very low in <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> measurements. This means that they are no danger for the bridge. Another conclusion is that measurements should be done on other bridges to see how the stress range of the traffic actually is compared to Eurocode. One should also review the FLM 4 and see if it could be modified to fit the Swedish conditions of vehicle design and distribu-tion. Another thing that might be overlooked is if there could be some sort of collective pa-rameter, taking the fact that not all vehicles are fully loaded in to account. For future struc-tures maybe it would be in place to start cooperate between the designing sector and the truck manufactures to make both the trucks and the bridges as optimized as there can be, and to avoid unnecessary fatigue contribution.
