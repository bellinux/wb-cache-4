25|$|The {{train service}} during the Cornwall Railway {{years had been}} of five {{passenger}} trains each way daily, calling at all stations; there was an additional train each way in the summer months. As well as the stations themselves there were stops at ticket platforms at Truro and Falmouth, and the journey time was two hours 30 minutes Plymouth to Truro (53 miles) and a further half-hour to Falmouth (13 miles). (The service from Penzance to London was by <b>through</b> <b>carriage,</b> shunted from one train on to another.)

500|$|On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland {{became an}} {{isolated}} {{part of the}} Scottish division of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), the Caledonian {{to the south and}} Highland to the west both becoming part of a different group, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. That summer a sleeping carriage operated between Lossiemouth and , and a <b>through</b> <b>carriage</b> ran from [...] to Cruden Bay on Fridays. Sunday services were re-introduced; from 1928 Aberdeen suburban services ran hourly during the afternoon and evenings. Afterwards the economic situation deteriorated and the railway companies advised the trade unions in 1928 that wages would need to be cut; this was implemented in August 1930 after the Wall Street Crash the previous year. Economy measures were introduced and unprofitable passenger services withdrawn, the Oldmeldrum branch closing on 2 November 1931 and the branch to Cruden Bay and Boddam on 31 October 1932. Road transport was arranged for guests at the Cruden Bay hotel, from Ellon for the first summer season, and then from Aberdeen.|$|E
