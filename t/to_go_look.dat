5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
25|$|In New York City's Central Park, {{people begin}} {{committing}} mass suicide. Initially {{believed to be}} caused by a bio-terrorist attack using an airborne neurotoxin, the behavior quickly spreads across the northeastern United States. Elliot Moore, a high school science teacher in Philadelphia, hears about the attacks and decides to go to Harrisburg by train with his wife, Alma. They are accompanied by his friend Julian and Julian's eight-year-old daughter Jess. Julian's wife is stuck in Philadelphia but is expected to meet them in Harrisburg. The train loses all radio contact en route and stops at a small town. They receive word that Philadelphia has been attacked by the toxin and Julian's wife was not able to get on the train to Harrisburg, instead taking a bus to Princeton. Julian decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for her, leaving his daughter with the Moores while he hitches a ride. However, when they get to Princeton, it has already been hit by the toxin. Succumbing to it, the driver runs the car into a tree and Julian commits suicide.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Madoc story" [...] {{remained}} {{popular in}} later centuries, and a later development asserted that Madoc's voyagers had intermarried with local Native Americans, {{and that their}} Welsh-speaking descendants still live somewhere in the United States. These [...] "Welsh Indians" [...] were credited {{with the construction of}} a number of landmarks throughout the Midwestern United States, and a number of white travelers were inspired <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for them. The [...] "Madoc story" [...] {{has been the subject of}} much speculation in the context of possible pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. No conclusive archaeological proof of such a man or his voyages has been found in the New or Old World; however, speculation abounds connecting him with certain sites, such as Devil's Backbone, located on the Ohio River at Fourteen Mile Creek near Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E

60|$|On his {{way back}} to the Green Forest near Farmer Brown's home, Blacky the Crow kept a sharp watch for Old Man Coyote. But Old Man Coyote was nowhere to be seen, and it was too late <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for him, because jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had already gone to bed behind the Purple Hills and the Black Shadows were hurrying towards the Green Forest.|$|E

60|$|At last {{he reached}} the blueberry-patch. Very softly he crept {{to a place where}} he could see and not be seen. No one was there. No, Sir, no one was there! He waited and watched, and there wasn't a hair of Peter Rabbit to be seen. He was just getting ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for Peter's tracks when he heard that thump, thump again. This time it came from his {{favorite}} clover-patch where he never allowed even his favorite daughter, little Miss Fuzzytail, to go. Anger nearly choked him as he hurried in that direction. But when he got there, just as before no one was to be seen.|$|E
6000|$|Old Mrs. Possum {{was quite}} right. Unc' Billy had {{forgotten}} all about that dinner. You see he had something else on his mind. While he had been playing with his children, he had thought that he heard a voice way off in the distance, and it had sounded very, {{very much like the}} voice of an old friend from way down South in [...] "Ol' Virginny." [...] He had listened and listened but didn't hear it again, and yet he was sure he had heard it that once. The very thought that that old friend of his might be somewhere in the Green Forest excited Unc' Billy so that it fairly made him homesick. He just had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for him.|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} {{made up his mind}} that he would have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> for a hollow in one of the trees in the Old Orchard in which to spend the night, when {{around the corner of the}} house came Farmer Brown's boy with {{something}} under one arm and dragging a ladder. He whistled cheerily to Happy Jack as he put the ladder against the tree and climbed up. By this time Happy Jack had grown so timid that he was just a little afraid of Farmer Brown's boy, so he climbed as high up in the tree as he could get and watched what was going on below. Even if he was afraid, there was comfort in having Farmer Brown's boy near.|$|E

50|$|About 1975, {{two local}} guides guiding some Europeans {{hoping to see}} the white bison said they had not seen a 'white bison' in the last 15 or 20 years.

60|$|Having her lily {{handkerchief}} in {{token of}} adieu to the departing travellers, Mrs. Lambert and her girls watched them pacing leisurely {{on the first}} few hundred yards of their journey, and {{until such time as}} a tree-clumped corner of the road hid them from the ladies' view. Behind that clump of limes the good matron had many a time watched those she loved best disappear. Husband departing to battle and danger, sons to school, each after the other had gone on his way behind yonder green trees, returning as it pleased Heaven's will at his good time, and bringing pleasure and love back to the happy little family. Besides their own instinctive nature (which to be sure aids wonderfully in the matter), the leisure and contemplation attendant upon their home life serve to foster the tenderness and fidelity of our women. The men gone, there is all day to think about them, and to-morrow and to-morrow--when there certainly will be a letter--and so on. There is the vacant room <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>look</b> at, where the boy slept last night, and the impression of his carpet bag is still on the bed. There is his whip hung up in the hall, and his fishing-rod and basket--mute memorials of the brief bygone pleasures. At dinner there comes up that cherry-tart, half of which our darling ate at two o'clock in spite of his melancholy, and with a choking little sister on each side of him. The evening prayer is said without that young scholar's voice to utter the due responses. Midnight and silence come, and the good mother lies wakeful, thinking how one of the dear accustomed brood is away from the nest. Morn breaks, home and holidays have passed away, and toil and labour have begun for him. So those rustling limes formed, as it were, a screen between the world and our ladies of the house at Oakhurst. Kind-hearted Mrs. Lambert always became silent and thoughtful, if by chance she and her girls walked up to the trees {{in the absence of the}} men of the family. She said she would like to carve their names up on the grey silvered trunks, in the midst of true-lovers' knots, as was then the kindly fashion; and Miss Theo, who had an exceeding elegant turn that way, made some verses regarding the trees, which her delighted parent transmitted to a periodical of those days.|$|E
