Military courts were established <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> resisting the NDH authorities. Armed guards were posted {{at the entrance}} to towns and villages, and any armed civilians were to be disarmed and brought to military authorities. Laxa issued an order that gave the rebels until 2 July to submit to the authorities. On that day, after the Prohaska group broke through to Nevesinje from Mostar, Prohaska sent a company of the 6th Battalion to Kifino Selo to meet the two companies of the 11th Battalion advancing from Plužine. Despite ZNDH air support, the company of the 6th Battalion was attacked by rebels near the entrance to Kifino Selo and the majority broke and ran. Prohaska had to send reserves to block the road between Nevesinje and Kifino Selo, and the companies from the 11th Battalion began to reconnoitre the rebel positions towards Odžak.|$|E

40|$|Mobile agents offer a new {{paradigm}} for distributed computation, but their potential benefits must be weighted against the very security threats they pose. These threats originate not just in malicious agents but malicious hosts as well. Thus security is a very crucial issue in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> mobile agent systems without which their implementation in real life applications will be rendered useless. This paper highlights the problems encountered in a mobile agent system from a host’s point of view {{as well as from}} a mobile agents point of view, as well as the various approaches <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> problems. The paper concludes with the implementation of two mobile agent systems: Aglets & D’Agents and describes their approaches to integrate security into the system. 1...|$|R
25|$|Official court posts are {{the most}} {{difficult}} to describe. Some court officials held responsibilities important to both the court and the country; the functions of others evolved over the centuries.

The literary criticisms, generally distinguished by keen and independent judgment, and the excerpts vary considerably in length. The numerous biographical notes are probably taken from the work of Hesychius of Miletus.|$|E
500|$|Poverty in the interwar years (1918–1939) was {{responsible}} for several measures which largely killed off the Poor Law system. The Board of Guardians (Default) Act 1926 was passed in response to some Boards of Guardians supporting the Miners during the General Strike. Workhouses were officially abolished by the Local Government Act 1929, and between 1929 and 1930 Poor Law Guardians, the [...] "workhouse test" [...] and the term [...] "pauper" [...] disappeared.

500|$|Homer and Bart try {{to think}} of a way that Duncan can make money to help offset the costs of keeping him. Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and {{suggests}} that he should be a racehorse. Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track, with Bart as the jockey. However, a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished. Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named [...] "Furious D", complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa's bracelets for a nose ring. He intimidates the other horses and wins several races. Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge, which {{turns out to be a}} secret lair. The jockeys reveal themselves to be crazy, arrogant elf-based creatures and demand Homer to have Duncan lose the upcoming race, threatening to eat Homer's brain if he refuses to comply. Though frightened at first, Homer changes his mind due to his loyalty to his son and his horse as well as his own pride, vowing <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> [...] "murderous trolls".|$|E

For six whole months there is no further word from his son. Then comes the bombshell. In a moving letter of 21 January 1787, Schleiermacher admits that the doubts alluded to are his own.

At the first event, Anwesh {{spoke of the}} need {{to break out of the}} Gender Binary. Through the talk, he {{challenged}} a world where sex and gender are often used interchangeably when in reality there exists a clear distinction between the two. He imagines a world where one's identity isn't limited to the binary male or female, but can manifest as a spectrum of infinite possibilities. His second TEDx talk, [...] "Tapping into your Alice," [...] related to growing up in a society that did not know how <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> who did not conform to gender stereotypes, in addition to how adulthood drains us of our belief in magic.|$|E
2500|$|Some Christian writers later {{rejected}} the idea that humans could bring back {{the spirits of the}} dead and interpreted such shades as disguised demons instead, thus conflating necromancy with demon summoning. Caesarius of Arles entreats his audience to put no stock in any demons or gods other than the Christian God, even if the working of spells appears to provide benefit. He states that demons only act with divine permission and are permitted by God to test Christian people. Caesarius does not condemn man here; he only states that the art of necromancy exists, although it is prohibited by the Bible. [...] On the other hand, some Christians believe that necromancy is real (along with other facets of the occult [...] "magic") but God has not suffered Christians <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> spirits (Deuteronomy 18:14). Still others believe the phantom of Samuel to be a trick, like the hoax séances conducted by many early 20th century illusionist spiritualists, which fooled those recording the events of Samuel's life.|$|E

Brown, Coleman attacked Brown for poor leadership during Hurricane Katrina disaster relief efforts, [...] "you didn't provide the leadership, even with structural infirmities." [...] Coleman went on, [...] "you're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies" [...] and [...] "the record reflects that you didn't get it or you didn't in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do {{what has to be done}} until way after it should have been done." [...] Brown responded combatively, [...] "well, Senator, that's very easy for you to say sitting behind that dais and not being there in the middle of that disaster, watching that human suffering and watching those people dying and trying <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> structural dysfunctionalities" [...] and implored Coleman to stick to questions. He later likened Coleman's charges to a [...] "drive-by shooting." [...] Brown had recently stated that he notified Department of Homeland Security and the White House of the tremendous scale of Katrina flooding earlier than had been previously reported.|$|E

This book is born of this movement, and <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> {{some of the issues}} that new and aspiring heads of department will have to address as they start on this endeavour. In order to compile this book, the authors invited respected mathematics educators and theorists to contribute, asking them to be very clear that they were ‘putting theory into practice’ for subject leaders in mathematics. Many of the authors work alongside current leaders of mathematics departments and the others are actively engaged in schools or with teachers of mathematics. ...|$|R

40|$|In 2013, the Blue Mountains {{region of}} NSW {{experienced}} devastating bushfires. In response, the Step By Step Blue Mountains Bushfire Support Service {{was established by}} the Ministry of Police and Emergency Services and a local Blue Mountains service, Gateway Family Support. The service was to support bushfire-affected community members through a strengthsbased and solution-focused approach. This approach {{has been used in}} other support services but limited evidence exists on the effectiveness of its use in disaster recovery. The integration of research {{in the early stages of}} disaster recovery service design may prove a valuable way to support the work of governments and service delivery organisations and is an important aspect of disaster preparedness and community wellbeing. This paper highlights the vulnerability of the Blue Mountains region to bushfire and examines the 2013 response by the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services Disaster Welfare Service (DWS) in association with Gateway Family Services. The DWS and Gateway Family Services collaborated to implement the service. This paper concludes that support services should be flexible in their response <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> recovering from traumatic experiences such as bushfires. It demonstrates that evaluation of existing disaster support programs could better inform future disaster responses and services to assist communities to better cope and rebuild their lives...|$|R
