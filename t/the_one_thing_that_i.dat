2500|$|Opposition to Roe on {{the bench}} grew when President Reagan, who {{supported}} legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied {{that there was any}} litmus test: [...] "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law. We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You take a {{pleasure}} to torment me," [...] said I, [...] "and I make a very feckless plaything; {{but let me ask}} you to be more merciful. At this time there is but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "But <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{has power}} {{completely}} is love, because {{when a man}} loves, he seeks no power, and therefore he has power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{thinking}} of my words," [...] said I. [...] "My heart bleeds for you, Miss Drummond. Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in your difficult position. But there is just <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish you would bear in view, {{if it was only}} long enough to discuss it quietly; for {{there is going to be}} a collieshangie when we two get home. Take my word for it, it will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} myself," [...] he said. [...] "I don't {{think that}} anyone could have loved his father better than I have done; but since I broke down when I first went to my room I seem to have no inclination {{to give way to}} sorrow. I feel frozen up; my voice does not sound to me as if it were my own; I am able to discuss matters as calmly as if I were speaking of a stranger. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel passionately anxious about is to set out on the track of the assassin." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{find myself}} still {{sitting in front}} of the last book by Mr. H. G. Wells, I say stunned with admiration, my family says sleepy with fatigue. I still feel vaguely all the things in Mr. Wells's book which I agree with; and I still feel vividly <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> deny. I deny that biology can destroy the sense of truth, which alone can even desire biology. No truth which I find can deny that I am seeking the truth. My mind cannot find {{anything}} which denies my mind... But what is all this? This is no sort of talk for a genial essay. Let us change the subject; let us have a romance or a fable or a fairy tale.|$|E

50|$|This {{heartwarming}} film {{is about}} a dog named Cooper who is the lone survivor of a terrible car accident. Jake, a family patriarch, loses {{his wife and children}} in the accident. Not being a dog person, Jake is angry and resentful toward the dog for even having survived. However, Jake eventually bonds with Cooper, and this bond ends up being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> gets him out of bed in <b>the</b> morning: <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> helps him to go on living after such a tragic loss.|$|R
6000|$|... "Byrne," [...] said Theriere, and it {{was easy}} to see that only through the {{strength}} of his will-power did he keep his temper, [...] "you may have cause to suspect the motives of everyone connected with this outfit. I can't say that I blame you; but I want you to remember what I say to you now. There was a time when I fully intended to 'double-cross' you, as you say--that was before you saved my life. Since then I have been on the square with you not only in deed but in thought as well. I give you the word of a man whose word once meant something--I am playing square with you now except in one thing, and I shall tell you what that is at once. I do not know where Miss Harding is, or what has happened to her, and Miller, and Swenson. That is God's truth. Now for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> just mentioned. Recently I changed my intentions relative to Miss Harding. I was after the money the same as the rest--that I am free to admit; but now I don't give a rap for it, and I had intended taking advantage of the first opportunity to return Miss Harding to civilization unharmed and without the payment of a penny to anyone. The reason for my change of heart is my own affair. In all probability you wouldn't believe the sincerity or honesty of my motives should I disclose them. I am only telling you these things because you have accused me of double dealing, and I do not want the man who saved my life at the risk of his own to have the slightest grounds to doubt my honesty with him. I've been a fairly bad egg, Byrne, for a great many years; but, by George! I'm not entirely rotten yet." ...|$|E

In a recent survey, 89 {{percent of the}} people said swearing is an issue with them. Jim O'Connor runs the Cuss Control Academy, which teaches people how to stop swearing. I agree that swearing is terrible, and I'm going to quit." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Although I {{believe in}} religion, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe in even more is that Mongolia should stand firmly {{on her feet}} to become an {{independent}} country.

5000|$|Salonen {{made his}} U.S. {{conducting}} debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1984. His initial reaction was as follows: I {{had no idea}} what to expect. But <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't expect was when an older player came to talk to me after the first concert and said, 'Consider this your future home'. Something was going on, because I felt the same. I sensed with an absolute certainty that this orchestra, in whatever way, was going to be a very important part of my life. Always.|$|E
5000|$|I love LSD, I just don't, I just... And I don't {{think that}} LSD is an {{addictive}} drug personally, but, I {{had tried to}} stop taking crack {{in the past and}} I tried to stop drinking in the past and say, [...] "OK, I won't drink, I'll just smoke pot" [...] or [...] "I won't take crack, I'll just drink" [...] and whatever <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> decided I would do, I did so much of it to compensate for not doing anything else because that's how I was.
