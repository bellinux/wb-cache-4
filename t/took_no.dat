5|$|A later senatorial {{investigation}} into {{the disappearance of the}} public funds <b>took</b> <b>no</b> action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony. Octavian made another bold move in 44BC when, without official permission, he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome's Near Eastern province to Italy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest <b>took</b> <b>no</b> further interest in his wife.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, {{in a report}} to the House of Representatives, a {{criminal}} appeal similar to that in England: a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases, and no writs of error in capital cases. Randolph's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole, which <b>took</b> <b>no</b> action.|$|E

5|$|Waris Ali Meerza, {{the third}} Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, died in 1969, and he <b>took</b> <b>no</b> steps during his {{lifetime}} to establish his succession. And before declaring his successor Waris Ali died. There was no clear successor to Waris Ali.|$|E
5|$|A {{large-scale}} uprising {{erupted in}} Serbia following the Axis {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. Although they <b>took</b> <b>no</b> part in the rebellion, Jews were targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. The Germans soon implemented a number of anti-Jewish laws, {{and by the end}} of August 1941, all Serbian Jewish males were interned in concentration camps, primarily at Topovske Šupe in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|After {{commanding}} the defence of Taunton, Blake {{was ordered to}} capture Dunster Castle, which he achieved after a nine-month siege. After the war, he was honoured by Parliament for his efforts and rewarded with £500, while a further £2,000 was split amongst his men. He <b>took</b> <b>no</b> side during the Second Civil War and, three years later, under the Commonwealth of England, he became a general at sea, {{as one of the}} three commissioners of the navy, and spent {{the rest of his life}} as a naval commander, for which he remains best known.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she <b>took</b> <b>no</b> action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first class record (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and <b>took</b> <b>no</b> wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded to step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E

5|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game <b>took</b> <b>no</b> action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.|$|E
5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court <b>took</b> <b>no</b> interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army approached, Lee {{chose to}} make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam. The V Corps was held in reserve {{in the center of}} Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place {{over the course of the}} day. The V Corps, however, <b>took</b> <b>no</b> part in these assaults. Historians have criticized McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not {{committing}} the V Corps which might have broken Lee's army.|$|E

5|$|Crillon's {{service with}} Spain was further rewarded in 1783 {{with the title}} of Knight of the Golden Fleece. He was {{appointed}} captain-general of the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. He remained in Spain {{during the years of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, writing his memoirs (Memoires militaires de Louis de Berton des Balbes de Quiers), published in 1791.) He <b>took</b> <b>no</b> part in the War of the Pyrenees (1793–95) between Spain and revolutionary France, but {{played a significant role in}} agreeing the peace that terminated the conflict. He died in Madrid in June 1796.|$|E

The Soviet system remained in place, though Western nations reacted by giving their athletes greater state support.|$|E
5|$|During a 19 May 1991 {{air show}} at Fairchild, Holland was the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} violated several safety regulations, including exceeding bank and pitch limits, flying {{directly over the}} air-show spectators, and possibly violating altitude restrictions. The base and wing commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, along with his staff, observed the demonstration, but apparently <b>took</b> <b>no</b> action.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Molotov {{was sent}} to Ukraine {{to take part in}} the civil war then {{breaking}} out. Since he was not a military man, he <b>took</b> <b>no</b> part in the fighting.

Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the Central Committee and Orgburo, and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1921, and held the office of Responsible Secretary and also married Soviet politician Polina Zhemchuzhina.|$|E
