5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

[...] "Did she know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> her?" [...] To this the other made no {{immediate}} answer. The Doctor was a man who, in such a matter, was intelligent enough, and he therefore put his question in another shape.

500|$|The {{theme of}} {{tolerance}} is further {{reflected in the}} song's chorus, where Harrison urges: [...] "Don't be so hard on the ones <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> / It's the ones <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love,</b> we think so little of..." [...] The chorus lyrics echo the message of [...] "Isn't It a Pity", in this case, author Ian Inglis writes, providing a [...] "bleak assessment of the human condition".|$|E
500|$|Will you {{proclaim}} to {{the world}} that you who carry liberty and democracy to Europe have no liberty here, that you who are fighting for democracy in Germany, suppress democracy right here in New York, in the United States? Are you going to suppress free speech and liberty in this country, and still pretend <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> liberty so much that you will fight for it five thousand miles away? ...|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and jöluns wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ...

[...] According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription [...] "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon {{the recipient of the}} charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears [...] "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".|$|E

500|$|... "Beside You", {{the second}} {{song on the}} album, has been {{described}} as [...] "expressionistic poetry and a scattershot collection of images and scenarios". [...] It begins with the classical guitar of Jay Berliner and Morrison's voice circling each other. Morrison described it as [...] "the kind of song that you'd sing to a kid or somebody <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love.</b> [...] It's basically a love song. It's just a song about being spiritually beside somebody." [...] It was originally recorded for Bang Records in December 1967. That first recording shows the pop music intentions of Bert Berns which give it a different sound from the Astral Weeks recording.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics, {{according}} to Brown are about relationships, {{and to be}} there for each other. That it does not matter to say merely <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> them, the only thing that they care is that their lover give his promise that he will be there for them whenever they need him. In [...] "Say You'll Be There", the group exuded a brash confidence that was attractive to their teenage and young adult fans. The Spice Girls decide to be friends, not lovers, the clear message is that the relationship can be channelled and controlled by the girl, with an emphasis on stating where they come from and what they stand for.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{despite a}} few setbacks, {{military}} action {{seemed to go}} in Gebhard's favor, until October, 1583, when the Elector Palatine died, and Casimir disbanded his army {{and returned to his}} brother's court as guardian for the new duke, his 10-year-old nephew. In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to Francis Walsingham, adviser and spymaster to Queen Elizabeth: [...] "Our needs are pressing, and you [...] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, we have heard from our counsellors <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> and further the service of God." ...|$|E

500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who cares if it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes and tell me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E
500|$|... "Boy Oh Boy" [...] is a 90s–influenced electropop {{song with}} dancehall and reggae elements. Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune." ...|$|E
500|$|Later {{that year}} Cros led his brigade, {{as part of}} the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, at the Second Battle of Artois - an allied attempt to capture Vimy Ridge with an assault on a [...] wide stretch of the front. [...] Cros took {{particular}} care to inspire a keen esprit de corps in his men and {{on the eve of the}} attack told them: [...] "I am your father and you know that I love you as my children, if you want to show me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me in return, fight and kill lots of Boche". [...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode.

Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me, say that you need me too... best you ever had.

Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E
