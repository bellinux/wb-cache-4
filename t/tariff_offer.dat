40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} liberalizing tariffs and textile export quotas under Viet Nam’s accession to the WTO. To undertake the analysis, we develop a model of Viet Nam’s economy that reflects {{the importance of the}} duty exemption arrangements that allow export-oriented manufacturers to obtain intermediate inputs at world prices. The resulting GTAP-DD model is applied first to Viet Nam’s fourth multilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>offer,</b> and then to a hypothetical, deeper offer that takes Viet Nam’s average tariff below a simple average of 10 percent. The fourth offer is estimated to generate global gains of $ 460 million per year, of which over 60 percent accrues to Viet Nam. The deeper tariff experiment leads to annual gains of around $ 600 million per year, with $ 376 million accruing to Viet Nam. Under the fourth offer, most of the gains accrue from liberalization of the textile quotas, while the gains are roughly evenly split between tariff reform and textile quota abolition under the deeper reform scenario...|$|E

40|$|As {{residential}} {{energy markets}} open to competition, consumers {{can choose from}} a range of <b>tariffs</b> <b>offered</b> by different suppliers. We examine the relationship between the fixed charge levied on each consumer, and the variable charge per unit of energy used across all these tariffs. Data are the <b>tariffs</b> <b>offered</b> in April 2002 in the 14 electricity regions of Great Britain by seventeen suppliers, seven of whom operate nationally. Our analysis focuses on the revenue trade-off for the company. We identify the effect of payment method on the relationship between fixed and variable charge. We find significant effects of the distribution and transmission charges which the suppliers pay in each area, as well as the size of the market both by number of customers and area; and confirm that incumbents charge significantly more that entrants. We also find significant differences between the prepayment and credit tariffs. Energy Competition, Non Linear Pricing, Simultaneous Equation Models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Successive trade {{reforms have}} greatly opened the Chinese {{economy and the}} reforms offered for WTO {{accession}} involve further liberalization. To assess {{the implications of the}} <b>tariff</b> <b>offers,</b> we take into account the tariff exemptions that are especially important in China’s trade regime, and the reductions in the variability of tariffs at the tariff line level required by the WTO offers. The analysis suggests that these offers will result in real income gains of over $ 50 billion, benefiting both China and its major trading partners. Omitting the tariff exemptions is shown to result in over-estimation of the benefits from liberalization, while focusing on average tariff reductions leads to under-estimation.

We use computing intensive methods {{to fit the}} solution of this model to many nonlinear <b>tariffs</b> <b>offered</b> by incumbent monopolists in several early local U. S. cellular telephone markets. For each market, numerical solutions of two–point boundary problems identify the marginal cost, average price sensitivity of demand, marginal consumer type, and indexing parameters governing {{the distribution of the}} two-dimensional type components. The sources of identification are the position, shape, and allowance of free minutes that defines each <b>tariff</b> <b>offered</b> by monopolists as well as a measure of market penetration in each cellular market during the first and last quarter of monopoly regime. We use the distribution of these structural parameters across markets and time to evaluate the magnitude of the inefficient provision of goods due to asymmetric information, the importance of bunching of different consumer types, and the empirical relevance of random participation constraints. We use these structural parameters to provide a first performance comparison â€”profits and welfareâ€” of nonlinear tariffs relative to linear, optimal two-part, Coasian marginal cost-plus fixed fee, and flat tariffs. We furthermore evaluate the potential welfare gains of alternative policies such as implementing a universal service requirement or allowing a second identical cellular telephone carrier. Finally, we also conduct a descriptive analysis of the sample variation of all structurally identified variables conditional on the observable characteristics of markets and cellular carriersNonlinear Pricing; Random Participation;Bucket Tariffs; Quantity Underprovision; Nonlinear vs. Restricted Pricing; Universal Service; Divestiture...|$|R

30|$|Customers have {{to choose}} one tariff out of those offered from their local utilities. In order to select the optimal tariff, i.e., the one fitting their {{electricity}} consumption at a given time, customers need to match their current usage habits to the offered pricing schemes. As an example, consider an energy provider which is interested in moving energy consumption away from times with high demand because this decreases the amount of immediately available but expensive energy resources. In order to encourage customers to use energy at off-peak times, the provider could <b>offer</b> better <b>tariffs</b> for load profiles that are dissimilar to normal consumption profiles by, e.g., lowering a fixed-price tariff from 23 cents/kWh to 17 cents/kWh. As another example, in order to stimulate people loading their cars during the night instead of during the day, a load profile with high values during night might be associated with another cheap tariff. A convenient way to perform the matching of current and desired consumption profiles is for the customer to provide a current load profile, i.e., a recent energy usage record, to different energy providers or to a third party providing a matchmaking service for <b>tariffs</b> <b>offered</b> by various energy providers.|$|R
