5|$|In July 2002, {{the project}} {{released}} version 3.0, code-named Woody, the first release to include cryptographic software, a free licensed KDE and internationalization. During <b>these</b> <b>last</b> release cycles, the Debian project drew considerable {{criticism from the}} free software community because of the long time between stable releases.|$|E
5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E
5|$|The MiG-9 {{was flown}} in Soviet service by fighter regiments in the 1st, 7th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Air Armies. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> two were based near Kaliningrad and in East Germany respectively. In addition, the 177th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 303rd Aviation Division near Yaroslavl flew the {{aircraft}} in 1949.|$|E

5|$|The great circles {{represent}} the ecliptic (wider oblique arc), the equator, and two meridians. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> three are positioned {{so that the}} intersections between each two arcs make a right angle; one meridian lies on the flag's plane while the other is perpendicular to it.|$|E
5|$|Between <b>these</b> <b>last</b> two speeds, if {{they both}} exist, is {{a range of}} forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates {{on the sides of}} the hull and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E

50|$|Besides the {{northern}} hinterland that bordered with Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Yugoslav People's Army also occupied sections of southern Dalmatia around Dubrovnik, {{as well as}} the islands of Vis and Lastovo. <b>These</b> <b>lasted</b> until 1992.|$|R
50|$|Only twenty cars, all driving motors, were {{converted}} for air-operated doors. These were all French built cars and {{were converted}} in 1920 {{for use with}} the 1920 stock. <b>These</b> <b>lasted</b> until 1930 when they were replaced by 'Standard Stock' driving motors.|$|R
5|$|In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) {{was formed}} as a joint venture by British Petroleum and Gulf. Both British Petroleum and Gulf held equal shares in the venture. KOC pioneered the {{exploration}} for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938 {{but it was not}} until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and gas being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1.|$|E
5|$|In Berlin Busoni was at {{the heart}} of the musical world of the Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, were regularly programmed. He continued to perform whilst his health allowed it; problems of hyperinflation in Germany meant that he needed to undertake tours to England. His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during <b>these</b> <b>last</b> years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he considered them informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E
50|$|The {{sand and}} gravel {{extraction}} industries made extensive use of narrow gauge railways, and several of <b>these</b> <b>lasted</b> into the 1980s - {{this was one of}} the last industries to make significant use of narrow gauge industrial railways in the UK.|$|R
30|$|The results {{presented}} in Table  9 {{provide evidence that}} the IECM had significant spectral leakage since the estimated values always were considerably lower than those obtained by the parametric methods. <b>These</b> <b>lasts,</b> in fact, estimate, for each component, values that differ slightly from each other.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} Baron Strabolgi {{was created in}} 1318 for the tenth Earl of Atholl. The barony twice went into long periods of abeyance, during which no claim to hold it could be established, the second of <b>these</b> <b>lasting</b> for over three hundred years.|$|R
5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E
5|$|Twice had {{received}} its mainland European premiere {{a day earlier}} than the first Coliseum performance, when it was given by the State Opera in Gießen, Germany. In 1998, Twice received its North American premiere in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and was also given in the United States, (by the New York Philharmonic,) Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. In <b>these</b> <b>last</b> two countries composer Oliver Knussen conducted. The work has continued to receive international performances, for example by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2009.|$|E

50|$|Newsreels, as documentaries, {{were the}} other major form of {{earliest}} Soviet cinema. Dziga Vertov's newsreel series Kino-Pravda, {{the best known of}} <b>these,</b> <b>lasted</b> from 1922 to 1925 and had a propagandistic bent; Vertov used the series to promote socialist realism but also to experiment with cinema.|$|R
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2001, the city, like the Somme Valley, had to suffer floods. <b>These</b> <b>lasted</b> several weeks, because of the {{saturation}} of the water table, {{the result of a}} year of exceptional precipitation. The station was inaccessible, the tracks being covered by several centimetres of water.|$|R
50|$|The most iconic {{carriage}} {{design of}} the LNER, <b>these</b> <b>lasted</b> well into BR ownership. Finalised in 1923, the design utilised a 60ft underframe, with more traditional squared moulding and windows and wooden teak-panelled bodies. There are two examples on the EOR a Buffet car and Brake Tourist Open (BTO) examples..|$|R
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). <b>These</b> <b>last</b> three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that <b>these</b> <b>last</b> two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E
5|$|In 1544 Henry VIII bequeathed {{the castle}} to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, but the {{property}} continued to decline. By the 1570s the castle and its earthworks {{had been allowed}} to become infested with rabbits, whose warrens caused extensive damage; a survey suggested that fully renovating the castle would cost £2,000, and that even if it were pulled down and sold for the value of its materials, it would only realise £66. At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings were pulled down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what <b>these</b> <b>last</b> two were then used for is uncertain. The foundations of the old chapel were slowly covered up by the earth defences.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 {{his wife}} Sarah died, {{although}} {{the cause is}} unrecorded. Evans remarried two years later in April 1818 to Hetty Ward, who was many years his junior and {{the daughter of the}} New York innkeeper. In <b>these</b> <b>last</b> years Evans lived in New York with his new wife. In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and after a month of illness, died on April 15, 1819. Just four days prior, on April 11, news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down, though his sons-in-law were committed to re-establishing the business and did so further outside of the city. Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan, but when that church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery, Broadway at 157th Street, New York City.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the NK 6th Division {{was ordered}} to await {{reinforcements}} before continuing the attack. The division's 13th, 15th and 14th regiments stretched from north to south. The first replacements arrived at Chinju on about August 12. Approximately 2,000 unarmed South Koreans conscripted in the Seoul area joined the division by August 15. At Chinju, the 6th Division issued them grenades and told the recruits {{they would have to}} pick up weapons from killed and wounded soldiers on the battlefield. Another group of 2,500 South Koreans joined the 6th Division on August 21, bringing the division strength to approximately 8,500 men. In the last week of August and the first week of September, 3,000 more recruits conscripted in southwest Korea joined the division. The 6th Division used <b>these</b> <b>last</b> recruits in labor details at only later employed them as combat troops. As part of the North Korean build-up in the south, the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan with another 10,000 men. The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the last}} time that the Hamilcar would be used in combat, but the model did remain in service {{for a number of years}} after the end of the Second World War; they were {{particularly}} useful for transporting large and heavy loads. On 31 December 1945 64 Hamilcars were recorded as being present at RAF Tarrant Rushton, where they were used for routine training exercises. However, in January 1946 a process was begun to dispose of 'surplus' Hamilcars, with 44 moved to disposal facilities and twenty remaining. The remainder continued to be used for routine flying exercises until July, when six more were disposed of due to 'glue deterioration', and by February 1947 only twelve were left in operation. <b>These</b> <b>last</b> few Hamilcars appear to have remained in service until 1950, with several used in airshows and public displays by the RAF, and were ultimately phased out as obsolescent by the mid-1950s.|$|E
