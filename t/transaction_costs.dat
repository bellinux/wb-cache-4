25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 legal scholars such as Adolf Augustus Berle, Edwin Dodd, and Gardiner C.

25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without <b>transaction</b> <b>costs,</b> people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

This essay develops a <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> explanation of these organizations role in rural areas. Since the traditional <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> theory is concerned with the choice of governance mechanisms within the for-profit sector, this essay adopts an alternative conceptualization of the notion of <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> by building on the theory of the division of labor. This theory regards <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> as a constraint on the division of labor causing the replacement of exchange with self-sufficiency. The proposed <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> explanation of rural third sector organizations consists of two arguments: 1) third sector organizations embody partial reliance on self-sufficiency; and 2) rural areas exhibit rurality-specific <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> acting as a constraint on the division of labor and thus creating a niche for third sector organizations.
