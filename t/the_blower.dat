5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for <b>the</b> <b>blower.</b> The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on <b>the</b> <b>blower,</b> and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>blower</b> {{was driven}} from the rods linking the {{cylinders}} to the wheels, thus the draught was {{proportional to the}} speed of the engine, not to how hard it is working as with a blastpipe. It is assumed that either <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> was worked by hand when the engine was standing or the drive wheels were lifted off the rails. Details of <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> design are not known for certain.|$|E

25|$|When the {{locomotive}} is running under power, a draught {{on the fire}} is created by the exhaust steam directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> valve. When the regulator is open, <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> valve. It is important that <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught – where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. <b>The</b> <b>blower</b> is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive's duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver's line of vision.|$|E

25|$|The {{means of}} {{securing}} the oil metering unit to the no. 2 cabin blower became ineffective and {{this led to}} the initiation of a fire within <b>the</b> <b>blower,</b> which propagated to the wing fuel tank and substantially reduced the strength of the main spar upper boom. It is probable that the separation of the oil metering unit arose from an out-of-balance condition induced by rotor break-up but the source of the rotor break-up could not be determined.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Roots type <b>blower</b> {{is named}} after the American inventors and {{brothers}} Philander and Francis Marion Roots, founders of <b>the</b> Roots <b>Blower</b> Company of Connersville, Indiana USA, who patented the basic design in 1860 as an air pump for use in blast furnaces and other industrial applications. In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler included a Roots-style blower in a patented engine design, making <b>the</b> Roots-type <b>blower</b> <b>the</b> oldest of the various designs now available. Roots blowers are {{commonly referred to as}} air blowers or PD (positive displacement) blowers, and can be commonly called [...] "huffers" [...] when used with the gasoline-burning engines in hot rod customized cars.|$|R
25|$|Following re-assembly, the {{locomotive}} was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog {{station on the}} Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> was not strong enough, and secondly operating the water feed pump caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the feed pump was five {{times the size of}} that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} control costs, Honda {{decided not to}} include the electric-assist air {{conditioning}} compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows the air conditioning compressor to continue running (using battery pack power) to maintain cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode. Instead, the Insight limits {{the duration of the}} Idle Stop mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer Idle Stop time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, the air conditioning stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During Idle Stop <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> continues to run albeit at a low speed.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate <b>the</b> <b>blower</b> motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

500|$|Snow blowers, {{also known}} as {{rotating}} snowplows or snow cutters, {{can be used in}} place of snowplows on winter service vehicles. A snow blower consists of a rapidly spinning auger which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached to the top of <b>the</b> <b>blower.</b> Snow blowers typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of [...] of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can.

[...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will guide you home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite hard to tell what the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you have a dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on <b>the</b> <b>blower,</b> only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s only me, infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E
