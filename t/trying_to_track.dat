25|$|The Government of India {{has decided}} to screen all people {{entering}} India via the main airport hubs of Mumbai, New Delhi, Goa, Jaipur, Kochi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. It said the primary {{focus will be on}} passengers entering from the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, France, and New Zealand. A team of 32 medical professionals have been posted at these airports. The Ministry of Health is also <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down people who have entered India from Mexico in the last 10 days. It has been reported that one person recently traveled from Texas to Hyderabad with flu symptoms and was quarantined, but authorities refused to divulge his identity. Government health officials & WHO subsequently stated that there is no Swine flu in India and the said patient recovered from a common cold. Three other suspected cases of swine flu have been noticed. Two of them were flying from Chicago and the other one, who is UK citizen, aged 35, arrived from London.

25|$|Looking for {{the murder}} site, a detective {{canvassing}} hotels heard about a man driving a blue Cadillac who cruised the area. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> the man down with this information, women were located who led them, not to a hotel, but to a residence where a blue Cadillac was seen. The registration was obtained, and the car was registered to Shulman's brother. Trying to get information about the sleeping bag in which Bunting was found, detectives learned Sears was the only manufacturer. Sears was contacted {{to see if the}} brother had purchased one with a credit card. Sears said the brother had no card, but pointed out that Shulman had a card. This was how police were initially pointed towards Shulman as a possible culprit. Women later identified him as the man cruising in the Cadillac, and cadaver dogs signaled the possibility of dead remains having been present in the Cadillac. Police searched Shulman's work place and found trace evidence matching that found on the body. Shulman was arrested on 6 April 1996. After interrogation, Shulman confessed to the three murders. (Shulman confessed to the earliest two murders at a later date.) A search of his room revealed hundreds of bloodstains scattered over almost every surface.|$|E

500|$|As {{the banking}} career {{was not working}} out – and as {{trainees}} were (after a period with a relaxed regime) again required to sit an exam, for which Bellman was ill equipped – he took a break in 1758, going {{to the university of}} Uppsala, where Linnaeus was professor of botany. The idea of attending lectures was no more congenial than banking, and he stayed only one term; one of his songs (FS 28) records that [...] "He contemplated Uppsala—the beer stung his mouth—love distracted his wits..." [...] However, he met young men (such as Carl Bonde) from wealthy and noble families, went drinking with them, and started to entertain them with his songs. Bellman returned to the bank job, and seems quickly to have fallen into financial difficulty: [...] "a jungle of debts, sureties and bondsmen began to proliferate around him." [...] The character of bailiff Blomberg appears in his songs (e.g. FS 14), constantly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down debtors and seize all their property. The law allowed the bankrupt only one way to escape from debtors' prison: to leave Sweden. In 1763, Bellman ran away to Norway. From the safety of Halden (then called Fredrikshald) he writes to the Council applying first for a passport, and then for a safe-conduct, both of which were granted. Meanwhile, his father had first mortgaged the Lilla Daurerska house, and then sold it: the family's finances were no better than his own. Even worse, by April 1764 the Bank had become tired of the riotous behaviour of its young men: its investigations showed that Bellman had been the ringleader, leading them (the Bank wrote) into [...] "gambling, masquerades, picnics and suchlike". Bellman resigned, his safe banking career at an end.|$|E

2500|$|Another point {{calling the}} map's {{authenticity}} into question was raised at the 1966 Conference: that one caption referred to Bishop Eirik of Greenland [...] "and neighboring regions" [...] (in Latin, [...] "regionumque finitimarum"), a title known previously {{from the work}} of religious scholar Luka Jelic (1863–1922). An essay by British researcher Peter Foote for the Saga Book of the Viking Society (vol. 11, part 1), published shortly after the conference, noted that German researcher Richard Hennig had spent years, before the Vinland Map was revealed, fruitlessly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> Jelic's phrase down in medieval texts. It seemed that either Jelic had seen the Vinland Map and promised not to reveal its existence (keeping the promise so rigidly that he never mentioned any of the other new historical information on the map), or that he had invented the phrase as a scholarly description, and the Vinland Map creator copied him. In practice, because Jelic's work had gone through three editions, Foote was able to demonstrate how the first edition (in French) had adopted the concept {{from the work of}} earlier researchers, listed by Jelic, then the later editions had adapted the anachronistic French scholarly phrase [...] "évèque régionnaire des contrées américaines" [...] into Latin.|$|E
2500|$|Some 350 {{people were}} {{detained}} 36 {{hours after the}} incident in Maharashtra— police claim that these are people rounded up for investigations. On 14 July, Lashkar-e-Qahhar, a terrorist organisation possibly linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), {{claimed responsibility for the}} bombings. In an e-mail to an Indian TV channel, the outfit says it organised the bombings using 16 people who are all [...] "safe". According to the e-mail, the main motive {{seems to have been a}} retaliation to the situation in the Gujarat and Kashmir regions, possibly referring to the alleged oppression of Muslim minorities in certain parts of the region. It also says that the blasts were part of a series of attacks aimed at other sites such as the Mumbai international airport, Gateway of India, the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Red Fort in New Delhi. The authorities are investigating this claim and are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> the location of the e-mail sender. However, on 17 July, the forensic science laboratory Mumbai has confirmed the use of a mixture of the highly explosive RDX and Ammonium Nitrate for the bombings. The presence of these explosives in the post explosive debris was confirmed by modern techniques such as Liquid Chromatography with mass detector (LCMS), Gas Chromatography with mass detector (GCMS) and Ion Scan Chromatography. They have indicated a strong possibility of all explosives being planted at the Churchgate railway station, which was the starting point for all affected trains.|$|E

2500|$|Former General Hospital head-writer, Ron Carlivati {{noted that}} [...] "Jason and Sam are an {{incredibly}} popular couple [...] a great couple {{who are very}} strong and very solid {{in a lot of}} ways. Former General Hospital head-writer Garin Wolf described Jason and Sam as an [...] "unconventional yet strong and unique couple." [...] Jason and Sam's similar love for danger and adrenaline have led them to be described as having a Bonnie and Clyde type of relationship. Several of their storylines have revolved around adventure with an [...] "us against the world" [...] theme present. The theme has been in place since the couple’s first meeting in the Port Charles Police Department, where they were both arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos. They have been on the run from law enforcement more than once; most notably in early 2005 when Sam was framed for kidnapping and Jason {{was the only one who}} believed her innocence, in the summer of 2005 when they went on the run with Sonny's oldest son Michael Corinthos (then Dylan Cash) to protect him from murder charges and again the fall of 2006 when Sam was being framed for murder. The couple was referred to as a real live [...] "Bonnie and Clyde" [...] onscreen on July 31, 2009, when they were arrested while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down runaways Michael and Kristina. The theme is further reinforced by the fact that the couple always turn to each other when dealing with high pressure situations, even during times of discord between them. They also have a similar comfort with living outside of the law and making their own rules. Former General Hospital head-writer Robert Guza, Jr. describes Sam as [...] "the last and only woman able to go toe to toe with Jason in action mode." ...|$|E

They eventually learn that the killer's name is Tyler Gray, and Card sanctions an off-the-books operation in Panama to take him down. However, when Michael finally captures him, Gray reveals that the operation is a sham: Card hired Gray to kill Anson and is planning a move that will kill Michael and his team. They escape, and Michael eventually confronts and kills Card, making every member of his team, as well as Maddie, targets in a CIA manhunt headed by Olivia Riley (Sonja Sohn). They consider escaping the country, but, while trying to gain leverage on Riley, they discover she has been working with a drug cartel in order to bring Michael down. Michael gets in contact with Bly to help get evidence for Riley's treason, but their mission fails and Bly is killed. Michael eventually forces a confession from Riley while on a boat under fire from the Coast Guard. Sam, Fiona, Jesse and Madeline spend about a month locked up, and when released, they find that Michael [...] "made a deal" [...] once more in return for his family and friends being freed from lifetime imprisonment. Fiona feels betrayed, reminding Michael he promised it would just be the two of them after this was all over. She backs away and tells Michael to leave her alone.|$|E
