25|$|The plot had young Humpty and his playmates {{turn into}} harlequinade {{characters}} and romp through a candy store, an enchanted garden and Manhattan's costly new City Hall. Fox's mute passivity set {{him apart from}} the raucous clamor surrounding him, and audiences took <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> to their hearts. Humpty Dumpty was revived several times. Fox eventually gave 1,128 performances in the title role, becoming the most highly paid actor of his time. He initiated the tradition of Wednesday matinee's {{to take advantage of}} the show's appeal to children.|$|E
25|$|Based on John O'Gready's {{world famous}} {{photograph}} of Norm Provan (St George) and Arthur Summons (Wests) after the 1963 Grand Final, the trophy represented the premiership pinnacle for {{players in the}} Winfield Era. Its image of the big man and <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> encompasses many of the finer things about Rugby League – the mateship after battle, the satisfaction of the shared experience {{on the playing field}} – no matter how hard and tough the struggle has been, the message that Rugby League, for all its professionalism, is still a game.|$|E
25|$|Thumb was not {{appearing}} in New York City when Lavinia was hired, but {{he met her}} when he visited the Museum {{in the autumn of}} 1862. He told Barnum the same day that he {{had fallen in love with}} her. Thumb wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> was rich.|$|E

25|$|This task is {{designed}} to measure spatial memory abilities in children. The experimenter asks the participant to visualize a blank matrix with a little man. Through a series of directional instructions such as forwards, backwards, left or right, the experimenter guides the participant's little man on a pathway throughout the matrix. At the end, the participant is asked to indicate on a real matrix where <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> {{that he or she}} visualized finished. The length of the pathway varies depending on the level of difficulty (1-10) and the matrices themselves may vary in length from 2 x 2 cells to 6 x 6.|$|E
25|$|In year 1843 Barnum {{hired the}} {{traditional}} Native American dancer fu-Hum-Me, {{the first of}} many Native Americans he presented. During 1844–45, Barnum toured with Tom Thumb in Europe and met Queen Victoria, who was amused and saddened by <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man,</b> and the event was a publicity coup. It opened the door to visits from royalty across Europe including the Czar of Russia and let him acquire dozens of attractions, including automatons and other mechanical marvels. He was almost able to buy the birth home of William Shakespeare. Barnum spent about three years abroad with Thumb. Barnum went on a spending spree, buying other museums, including Peale's museum in Philadelphia, the nation's first major museum. By late 1846, Barnum's Museum was drawing 400,000 visitors a year.|$|E

He attacked the current Croatian government and the prime minister Jadranka Kosor for ignoring the needs of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> and criticized her for not dealing with corruption. Andrija Hebrang started the campaign with patriotic rhetoric with the slogan 'For a proud and European Croatia'. He praised Jadranka Kosor and her policies, mostly criticizing Dragan Primorac and Nadan Vidošević for abandoning their party, calling them deserters and traitors of their party. He argued that he offered Primorac and Vidošević an opportunity to settle the question of who will be their party's nominee for president through a primary challenge stating that they both refused.|$|E

He started to spread rumors of Harding's supposed black heritage and encouraged local businessmen to boycott Harding's business interests. When Harding found out what Kling was doing, he warned Kling [...] "that he would beat the tar out of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> if he didn't cease".|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} two decades of his career, Chaplin {{concentrated}} on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights. In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still [...] "room for <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Man</b> in the atomic age". The first of these re-releases was The Chaplin Revue (1959), which included new versions of A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim.|$|E

500|$|When {{he began}} Louis Riel, Brown had {{increasingly}} been {{making use of}} notes and appendices in his work, beginning with his researching and annotating the 1994 comics essay, [...] "My Mom was a Schizophrenic". [...] He added appendices to the 1998 collection of short strips, <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Man,</b> and the 2002 reprinting of I Never Liked You. [...] In Louis Riel, the appendix totalled 23 pages, along with a bibliography and an index. [...] Alan Moore's use of extensive end notes in his and Eddie Campbell's From Hell, another fictional reconstruction of a historical event, influenced Brown's appendices. [...] In the comics essay [...] "Dance of the Gull Catchers" [...] which closes the From Hell appendices, Moore metaphorically reveals to the reader the myriad choices he could have made from the available historical evidence when putting together {{his version of the}} Jack the Ripper story.|$|E
500|$|... "The Broadcast" [...] {{is another}} instrumental, {{designed}} {{to give the impression}} of several radio signals interlaced, and bringing full-circle the concept established in the album's opening track, [...] "Reception". Over a musical backing of piano, mellotron and gizmotron, it features readings taken from the plays The Sport of Kings by Ian Hay and <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Man</b> by John Galsworthy. As a return to the proposed working-band concept, [...] "So Glad to See You Here", Rodriguez writes, [...] " [...] the anticipation of a live act guaranteed to 'knock 'em dead'" [...] and so recalls Wings' 1975–76 show-opening medley [...] "Venus and Mars/Rock Show". During the outro, the band reprise a line from [...] "We're Open Tonight".

500|$|Peter Bailey, in {{his study}} [...] "White Collars, Gray Lives" [...] (1999), traces the {{beginnings}} of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the [...] "disquieting irruption of {{a new breed of}} petty bourgeois shop and office workers" [...] that faced Victorian writers {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary [...] "a sharp analysis of social insecurity". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: [...] "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, [...] "has long been the intellectual's blood sport". However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. [...] Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as [...] "Denry Machin", [...] "Mr Polly" [...] or [...] "Mr Lewisham", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. [...] In cases such as these, writes Bailey, [...] "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Man...</b> was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis." ...|$|E

He merely did not elect to choose them for partners in the big game in which he intended to play. What that big game was, even he did not know. He was waiting to find it. And in the meantime he played small hands, investing in several arid-lands reclamation projects and keeping his eyes open for the big chance when it should come along.|$|R

2500|$|The {{feature of}} [...] "self-similarity", for instance, is easily {{understood}} by analogy to zooming {{in with a}} lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over. Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally {{such as in the}} infinite regress in parallel mirrors or the homunculus, <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> inside the head of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>man</b> inside the head...).
