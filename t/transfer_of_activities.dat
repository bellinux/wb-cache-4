In particular, the reduced model {{is used to}} monitor the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> (e. g. mass, energy) from larger to smaller scales. When the activity transfer rate exceeds a prescribed tolerance, the algorithm refines the mesh accordingly.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{challenging}} problem of constructing reduced {{models for the}} long time prediction of systems {{where there is no}} timescale separation between the resolved and unresolved variables. In previous work we focused on the case where there was only <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> (e. g. energy, mass) from the resolved to the unresolved variables. Here we investigate the much more difficult case where there is two-way <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> between the resolved and unresolved variables. Like in the case <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> drain out <b>of</b> the resolved variables, even if one starts with an exact formalism, like the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism, the constructed reduced models can become unstable. We show how to remedy this situation by using dynamic information from the full system to renormalize the MZ reduced models. In addition to being stabilized, the renormalized models can be accurate for very long times. We use the Korteweg-de Vries equation to illustrate the approach. The coefficients of the renormalized models exhibit rich structure, including algebraic time dependence and incomplete similarity.

40|$|This study {{recognizes that}} public safety organizations, {{including}} military units and fire services {{as well as}} the police, will normally be budget constrained. It also recognizes that subunits of these organizations will not always be employed in their highest priority activities. With those perspectives the study shows how such organizations can optimally redistribute resources and reallocations of activities between units in response to variable demands simultaneously with the determination of optimizing norms for levels and costs of activities and for transfers of resources and activities between units. The study draws on the ideas of variance analysis from accounting and peak load pricing and duality from economics to derive optimizing levels of activity for subunits within an organization in response to varying demands on the resources and performance of the organization as a whole. It also provides a critique of the standard data envelopment analysis aproach to activity analysis on the grounds not only that that approach is not cost related, but also that it does not provide for the endogenous <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> and resources between units. ...|$|E

Although the demand of PFI and privatisation is significantly increasing for the better quality of work and valuefor money from public sector and private sector, they are facing challenges of restructuring of the national economic and financing. In addition, the insufficient guidelines on how both PFI and privatisation should be dissimilarly implemented plus with limited fund by the public sector and financing problem by the private sector have reduced the services and the efforts of ideally implementing both the PFI and privatisation in the Malaysian infrastructure projects. Hence, this paper aims at theoretically reviewing the differences of implementation between PFI and privatisation in the Malaysian infrastructure project. It is expected that {{the findings of this study}} will propose proper guidelines of the different implementation between PFI and privatisation for infrastructure projects in better managing PFI and privatisation in the Malaysian construction industry.

40|$|Enhancing {{recovery}} from stroke with effective rehabilitation interventions remains an elusive goal. 1 Although intensive rehabilitation therapies such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) show promise, 2 the intervention {{has not been}} deployed in routine clinical practice. Slow uptake of CIMT in routine clinical practice {{has been attributed to}} its large demand on professional resources and patient compliance, as well as the costs associated with delivering high doses of therapy in a relatively short time. To remediate these limitations, there have been calls for modified versions of CIMT that are less intensive, lower cost, and easier to deliver. 3 Recent work by Barzel et al 4 attempted to advance the understanding of modified forms of CIMT by applying this therapy in the home setting. Home CIMT includes the basic elements of CIMT including repetitive training, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> and constraint of the nonparetic hand. However, Home CIMT attempts to accomplish each of these goals within the individual’s home setting under the supervision of a nonprofessional coach. 4 Although study participants were involved in overall goal setting for their therapeutic program, they only interacted with professional rehabilitation practitioners (Occupational or Physical Therapists) in 5 visits: 2 initial home visits to set up the program {{in the first week of}} a 4 -week program and 3 additional sessions to adjust the program during the next 3 weeks.

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at CSER 2009 and is also available at: [URL] organisations from different business sectors and with contrasting management approaches are increasingly prioritising the satisfaction of clients’ needs through service provision. The transformation of a company from predominantly product only to a product and service mix is studied. The transformation will generally involve the transfer of some activities {{from one part of}} the supply chain to another and, in some cases, this involves the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> previously carried out by the client to the product-service company. This paper describes the application of SSM (Soft Systems Methodology) to this transformation such that the views of those stakeholders across the supply chain can be captured and conflicting expectations and views can be highlighted. We provide an initial model for developing a SSM in defence construction organisations to show that the general approach is relevant to this particular feature of transformation. The SSM approach will lead to identification of barriers to transformation, the understanding of implications on overall performance and – importantly – the joint consideration of these matters and solution generation by customer and supplier in a non-confrontational fashion. The overall objective is to make recommendations that alleviate identified concerns, barriers and obstacles to this transformation. The outcomes of the research will show how the SSM conceptual models can help managers in either sector to realise the necessary activities needed to perform the transformation in a successful manner...|$|E

40|$|Privatization [...] the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> {{from the}} public {{to the private sector}} [...] gained {{international}} prominence in the 1980 s because of the need to reduce budget deficits and growing concerns about the efficiency of state-owned enterprises and government bureaucracies. This article examines privatization in Canada and its effect on governments' fiscal positions. Privatization has generally been less rapid and extensive in Canada than elsewhere, partly because of the comparatively moderate size of our public sector. Nevertheless, federal, provincial, and municipal governments have increasingly reduced their direct involvement in the Canadian economy by selling Crown corporations, contracting with private firms to deliver public services, and transferring the development of public infrastructure projects to the private sector. The fiscal impact of privatizing Crown corporations varies with such factors as the profitability of the enterprise, the size of the government's initial investment, and past write-downs. In general, when privatizations are part of a broader effort to improve public finances, they can contribute to fiscal consolidation by reducing budgetary requirements and debt levels. When services and infrastructure projects are privatized, it is expected that more efficient private sector management will reduce government expenditures. For example, a private consortium may be better able to manage the financial risks involved in building an infrastructure facility, such as cost overruns or the withdrawal of contractors, than the public sector. The key to raising efficiency and lowering costs, however, is competition, not privatization per se. Therefore, the cost savings arising from the privatization of services or public works depend crucially on the terms of the contract. Overall, when structured to improve economic efficiency, privatization is likely to enhance the economy's performance, thereby producing long-term economic and budgetary gains. ...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{sites are}} {{characterized}} by lack of space, uneven stacking surfaces and temporary storage locations. Studies show that {{about a third of}} a Swedish construction worker’s time is used to find and sort material. Thus, actions should be taken to simplify sorting and handling of material. Delivery of reinforcing bars to construction sites is a cumbersome and time-consuming process, which would benefit from simplified material handling. The goal of the thesis was to investigate how the delivery process of reinforcing bars could be improved by implementing a load carrier in the material flow. A case study was carried out, involving a reinforcing steel producer, a construction company and a material handling equipment provider. The study investigated the flow of reinforcing steel from the producer to a nearby construction site, {{with the aid of a}} load carrier designed by the logistic solutions provider. The material and information flow in the supply chain were mapped and analyzed in order to explore the effects of the load carrier. The mapping of the supply chain was carried out in accordance with the lean framework material flow mapping (MFM). The findings explored a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> from the construction site to the producer. The delivery of material at the construction site was simplified and time for handling material was reduced. However, the production site faces an increase in number of activities and time of order preparation. In addition, the load carrier implementation required reverse logistics to be incorporated in the supply chain. Resources in the supply chain were affected in terms of requirements and occupied time. The usage of the construction crane was significantly reduced, which was deemed as beneficial, as it was identified as a bottleneck resource. In addition, usage time of the truck was reduced by shorter loading and unloading processes. The load carrier implementation resulted in an increase in man-time at the producing site, while the opposite was experienced at the construction site. Also, the load carrier implementation required significant changes to the information and communication process in the supply chain. The aim with the analysis was to explore the positive effects of the load carrier and diminish the negative by suggesting a future state map of the supply chain including the load carrier. Thus, negative effects were targeted in the suggestion of the future state map. As so, a future state was presented to further develop the positive effects, while the negative effects were mitigated by reducing the number of activities, warehousing nodes and time in warehousing. Suggestions of changes to the load carrier were presented in order to better fit it into the supply chain’s activities. It appeared possible for the reinforcing bar supplier to expand the load carrier implementation into its value offering. However, a closer mapping of the cost of activities may be needed. Several barriers were identified, such as a supply chain wide understanding of the load carriers purpose, payment structure of transporters as well as strategy alignment of suppliers and customers...|$|E

Neste contexto "entram em cena" os consultores organizacionais ou as empresas de consultoria, com suas equipes de consultores, para ajudar dirigentes e empresas na empreitada de adequação à nova realidade e/ou ao estado desejado. O presente estudo teve o objetivo de retratar a realidade da qualidade de vida no trabalho destes profissionais que atuam como consultores de empresas e conhecer as fontes de pressão no trabalho presentes em seu dia-a-dia. Buscou leva ntar as condições que estão interferindo em seu trabalho e influenciando seu comportamento dentro e fora do trabalho. Como objetivos secundários buscou identificar fontes de satisfação e de insatisfação relacionadas ao conteúdo e ao contexto de trabalho da amostra destes profissionais, as fontes de pressão também relacionadas ao conteúdo e contexto destes profissionais bem como conhecer o perfil destes profissionais e suas características pessoais e profissionais. Utilizando abordagem teórica de HACKMAN & OLDHAM (1975) investigou diversas variáveis relacionadas ao contexto de trabalho bem como analisou também variáveis de conteúdo do trabalho, buscando diagnosticar as dimensões básicas das tarefas executadas. Ao investigar as fontes de pressão no trabalho, utilizando o referencial teórico de COOPER et al (1988), buscou diagnosticar as fontes de pressão potencialmente presentes no trabalho dos consultores, analisando fatores que estão ligados intrinsecamente ao trabalho ou relacionados ao papel exercido pelos dirigentes das empresas onde atuam, ou decorrentes do clima organizacional verificando também {{a interface}} e interferências entre o trabalho e a casa do consultor. The downsizing of the organizational framework reengineering and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> {{not tied to}} the main business of the company {{are some of the}} changes that have been introduced in many companies, and these changes have made thousands of people unemployed in Brazil. On other hand, new business opportunities have been opened up, {{and one of them is}} the possibility of working as a consultant. In this context, it is possible to notice that organizational consultants and consulting houses have been playing an increasingly important role by helping companies and their management to cope with the changes that they have to implement in order to achieve their goals. The present study aimed at portraying the actual quality of life presented by professionals who work as management consultants as well as identify the sources of pressures that these professionals have to handle in their everyday life. The secondary aims of this work can be listed as identify the sources of personal satisfaction and dissatisfaction presented by the professionals that have been investigated in connection with the content and the context of the work that they have to do, identify the sources of pressure related to both content and context of these professionals, establish the profile of these professionals as well as their personal and professional characteristics. Using the theoretical approach proposed by HACKMAN & OLDHAM (1975), several variables related to the work context and content have also been analyzed in order to identify the scope of the basic tasks performed by these professionals. In order to investigate the sources of pressure at work, using the theoretical reference provided by COOPER et all (1988), this work aimed at diagnosing the potential sources of pressure in the work of organizational consultants by means of using the analysis of variables that are intrinsically connected with working conditions or with the part played by the management of the companies where these professionals work.

40|$|Esta dissertação teve por objetivo compreender o desenvolvimento do pensamento arqueológico no Estado do Paraná. Considerando a historicidade da ciência e os contextos de produção de ideias, tal estudo buscou entender os mecanismos e estratégias levadas a cabo por José Loureiro Fernandes para promover cursos de aperfeiçoamento na Universidade do Paraná, nas décadas de 1950 a 1970. A fim de organizar as ideias no tempo e no espaço, a dissertação foi dividida em quatro capítulos. Nos dois primeiros, de forma introdutória e sobre o desenvolvimento da ciência paranaense, buscou-se mapear as principais informações no campo da arqueologia paranaense produzidas até a década de 1950, seja por viajantes e colecionadores particulares, seja por “autodidatas” no Museu Paranaense. A partir da constatação de Loureiro Fernandes da destruição de sítios arqueológicos e, havendo carência de técnicas e teorias para uma intervenção adequada e, ainda, devido ao declínio das atividades do Museu, notou-se a transferência das atividades para o âmbito da Universidade do Paraná no início da década de 1950. Com poucos recursos financeiros algumas pesquisas foram realizadas, acompanhadas por estudantes que tomavam contato com modelos e métodos de escavação. Da documentação analisada, observou-se o intenso empenho políticopedagógico de Loureiro Fernandes junto aos órgãos de fomento, e entre contatos e viagem internacionais, tomava forma mais clara seu projeto de promover cursos regulares para capacitar estudantes universitários interessados na pesquisa arqueológica. Com a criação do CEPA em 1956, alguns destes cursos foram analisados, como os promovidos pelo casal francês Joseph Emperaire e Annette Laming, Wesley Hurt, o casal norte-americano Clifford Evans e Betty Meggers, e outros professores brasileiros. Como resultado dos cursos, alunos foram capacitados para enfrentar os problemas arqueológicos brasileiros, teorias foram discutidas e testadas, terminologias criadas, metodologias aperfeiçoadas, enfim, da mistura de visões de ciência propiciou-se um repertório próprio, visto atualmente por muitos daqueles alunos como de suma importância para o desenvolvimento da arqueologia brasileira, que naquela época encontrava-se em fase quase amadora. This {{research}} aims {{appreciate the}} development of archaeological thinking in the State of Parana. Considering the historicity of science and the contexts of production of ideas, this study sought to understand the mechanisms and strategies implemented by Jose Loureiro Fernandes to promote improvement courses at the University do Parana, in the decades from 1950 to 1970. To propose of organize the ideas in time and space, this study was divided in four chapters. In the first two, treating the introduction and {{the development of}} archeology science in Parana, we attempted to map the main information in the field produced in the State until the 1950 s, either by private collectors and travelers, whether for “self-educated” at Museu Paranaense institution. From the observation of Loureiro Fernandes about the destruction of archaeological sites, and without attendance of techniques and theories for appropriate action, and also due to the decline of the activities of the Museum, figured out the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> to the scope of the University of Parana in the early 1950 s. With low financial resources some research was conducted, followed by students who took contact with models and methods of excavation. From the documents examined, there was observed the goal political-pedagogical by Loureiro Fernandes along with development agencies, and with contacts and international travels, took more clearly his project of promoting regular courses to training university students interested in archaeological research. With the creation of CEPA in 1956, some of these courses were analyzed, promoted by the French couple Joseph and Annette Laming Emperaire, Wesley Hurt, the American couple Clifford Evans and Betty Meggers, and other Brazilian teachers. As a result of the courses, students were trained to deal with archaeological issues in Brazil, theories were discussed and tested, terminologies created, methodologies improved, and at all, finally, a mixture of views of science provided a own repertoire, currently seen by many of those students as important for the development of Brazilian archeology, at that time was in almost amateur stage...|$|E

Next, we review task-related and resting-state functional connectivity studies that demonstrate a lesion-induced disruption of neural networks, the relationship of the extent of this disruption with motor performance, and the potential for network reorganization {{in the presence of a}} stroke lesion. We conclude with suggestions for future research and theories that may enhance the interpretation of changing functional connectivity. Overall findings suggest that a network level assessment provides a useful framework to examine brain reorganization and to potentially better predict behavioral outcomes following stroke...|$|R
