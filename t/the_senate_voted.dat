5|$|On December 23, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> 60–39 to end {{debate on}} the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster. The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote). The bill was {{endorsed}} by the AMA and AARP.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> for cloture by a 70-30 vote, thus {{overcoming}} {{the threat of}} filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill. On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77-19 vote (Democrats 47-16, Republicans 30-2); only Senators representing Southern states voted against it.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{appointment}} of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers {{were not considered}} to qualify him for his office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies were delighted {{at the prospect of}} connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.|$|E

50|$|The {{proceedings}} {{of a secret}} session are not published unless <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>votes,</b> during <b>the</b> meeting or at a later time, to release them. Then, those portions released are printed in the Congressional Record. If <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> does not approve release of a secret session transcript, the transcript is stored in <b>the</b> Office of <b>Senate</b> Security and ultimately sent to the National Archives and Records Administration. The proceedings remain sealed until <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>votes</b> to remove <b>the</b> injunction of secrecy.|$|R
5|$|On December 9, 1824, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> {{to repeal}} the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. The measure came to the House floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, a blatant violation of the rules of the House. The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|The non-partisan National Journal rates a Senator's votes by what {{percentage}} of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> more liberally than he or she, and {{what percentage}} more conservatively, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006 (as reported in the 2008 Almanac of American Politics), McCain's average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59percent conservative and 41percent liberal; social policy: 54percent conservative and 38percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56percent conservative and 43percent liberal. In 2012, the National Journal gave McCain a composite score of 73% conservative and 27% liberal. In 2013, the National Journal gave him a composite score of 60% conservative and 40% liberal.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>vote</b> took place, Sotomayor was {{questioned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee on July 28, 2009, which then voted out a recommendation to <b>the</b> full <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rise Up Australia Party {{received}} 0.4 {{percent of}} <b>the</b> nationwide <b>Senate</b> <b>vote</b> at <b>the</b> 2013 federal election and 0.3 percent of <b>the</b> nationwide <b>Senate</b> <b>vote</b> at <b>the</b> 2016 federal election. It has one councillor in the City of Casey, Rosalie Crestani.|$|R
25|$|This insured that <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>vote</b> {{would be}} put off till the second session in December. It also meant that the tariff would be a {{prominent}} issue in the 1860 election.|$|R
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since he was no longer a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{proposed}} to open negotiations with Spain {{on the basis}} of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million. McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.|$|E
40|$|This report discuses cloture, {{which is}} {{is the only}} {{procedure}} by which <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> can <b>vote</b> to set an end to a debate without also rejecting the bill, amendment, conference report, motion, or other matter it has been debating. A Senator can make a nondebatable motion to table an amendment, and if a majority of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>votes</b> for that motion, the effect is to reject the amendment. Thus, the motion to table cannot be used to conclude a debate when Senators still wish to speak and to enable <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to <b>vote</b> for <b>the</b> proposal it is considering. Only the cloture provisions of Rule XXII achieve this purpose...|$|R

25|$|The {{system for}} {{counting}} <b>Senate</b> <b>votes</b> is complicated, {{and a final}} result is sometimes not known for several weeks. When <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>vote</b> is counted, a quota for election is determined. This {{is the number of}} valid votes cast, divided by the number of Senators to be elected plus one.|$|R

25|$|On December 2, 1954, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> 67–22 to censure McCarthy, {{effectively}} eradicating his influence, {{though not}} expelling him from office.
