Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E

The book largely received negative reviews from both reviewers and politicians. Reviewing Indian roman à clefs in 2010, Nilanjana Roy noted that [...] "This 1998 novel by a former Indian PM is now justly forgotten [...] At 767 pages, [...] suffered from the defects of a great deal of Indian political writing—the gossip wasn’t good enough to justify the prolixity". Similarly, Sunanda Ray of The Telegraph noted that [...] "though grateful for the gift, I did not find the book gripping reading. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no idea whether Anand, the central figure, matches Narasimha Rao in every detail". A revised and expanded edition of the book that was published by Penguin in 2000 was reviewed by The Hindu as [...] "a book making heavy demands on the doggedness of a reader for withstanding an 833-page infliction from a former Prime Minister". On political grounds members of the Congress Party including Najma Heptullah were critical of Rao's novel while many BJP supporters dismissed it as a piece of sleazy writing.|$|E

2500|$|German {{veterans}} particularly criticized Schörner for a 1945 {{order that}} all soldiers found {{behind the front}} lines, who did not possess written orders {{to be in that}} particular area, were to be court-martialed on the spot and hanged if found guilty of desertion. This is mentioned in the writings of Siegfried Knappe, Hans von Luck, and Joseph Goebbels. [...] "Deserters get no mercy from him," [...] Goebbels wrote of Schörner on 11 March 1945. [...] "They are hanged from the nearest tree with a placard round their necks saying: 'I am a deserter. I have declined to defend German women and children and <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been hanged.'" [...] (Ich bin ein Deserteur. Ich habe mich geweigert, deutsche Frauen und Kinder zu beschützen und bin deshalb aufgehängt worden.) The approving Goebbels continued with, [...] "Naturally such methods are effective. Every man in Schörner's area knows that he may die at the front but will inevitably die in the rear." [...] Gottlob H. Bidermann, a German infantry officer who served in Schörner's command in 1944-45, reported in his memoirs that the General was despised by officers and men alike.|$|E

2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land on which you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And I have also established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I have remembered My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
