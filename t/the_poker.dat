The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> game. Having a sense of déjà vu during <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E

5|$|Lord Pitfour {{was widely}} admired and often dined with fellow lawyer and biographer James Boswell, who {{declared}} Pitfour {{to be one}} of the greatest Scottish lawyers. This was endorsed by the diarist John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736–1814), who remarked that Pitfour was one of a small number of barristers who he found satisfying to hear speak. Pitfour practised law in Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment and was a member of <b>The</b> <b>Poker</b> Club.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Casino Royale {{became the}} first Bond film ever to be shown in {{mainland}} Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that {{was added to the}} 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). Casino Royale has earned approximately $11.7million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5million.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} Allen Barra's Inventing Wyatt Earp. His Life and Many Legends, William Urban, a Professor of History at Monmouth College in Warren County, Illinois, {{pointed out}} a number of factual inaccuracies in the book. One inconsistency by Barra, pointed out by another reviewer, includes a description of <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> game the night before the shootout. Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Pollack’s {{emphasis}} on the player’s experience along with his effectiveness in growing the WSOP cast him in a good light. This can be seen most clearly through the extent of support he received when he announced his resignation as commissioner. One commentator declared, “the news hit <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> world … {{like a ton of}} bricks,” and that his tenure in the role “may be unmatched.” Well-known players like Phil Hellmuth, Peter Eastgate and Barry Goldstein expressed their esteem for Pollack.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tournament}} is {{restricted}} to casino employees, {{most of the big}} name poker professionals and previous bracelet winners are not allowed to participate. Therefore, even though the Casino Employee Championship is a World Series of Poker bracelet event, it has typically received relatively little coverage. Despite this perception, the Casino Employee Championship event does involve numerous recognized names in <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> world. The 2009 tournament included two time bracelet winner Pat Poels, WSOP vice president Ty Stewart, Bellagio Tournament Director/Former WSOP Director Jack McClelland, and Woman Poker Hall of Famer Marsha Waggoner.|$|E
5|$|Bond beats Le Chiffre at <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> table, but Lynd is {{kidnapped by}} Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is {{captured}} whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed {{for the money}} and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.|$|E

5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not {{for the first time}} during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and <b>the</b> <b>poker</b> match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E
