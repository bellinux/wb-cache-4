5|$|In 1985, the FAW did {{not have}} the use of a large {{national}} stadium. The National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park had opened the previous year, but was <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exclusive use of the Welsh Rugby Union; the first football game to be played there was not until 1989. The FAW instead took the national team to one of the stadia of Cardiff City, Swansea City or Wrexham, three of the four clubs who then played in the English football league system.|$|E

After moving to Taranaki in 1910, he was soon selected to represent the province. Coming close to winning the Ranfurly Shield in 1912, a subsequent challenge the following year was successful against the longtime holders Auckland. He earned selection to the North Island team for the annual Inter-Island match and thereafter was picked {{to play for the}} All Blacks, first to play Australia and <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tour of North America, in which he played 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 defeat of the All America team.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Vaughan Williams, {{who wrote}} in 1928 an {{arrangement}} of the traditional tune associated with the psalm, Old 100th ("All people that on earth do dwell"), arranged it for congregation, organ and orchestra for the coronation of Elizabeth II, becoming ubiquitous at festive occasions in the Anglophone world. Reger's setting, however, was not intended for church use, but first for a secular occasion, <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concert hall.|$|E

5|$|Ryder {{had hoped}} to be a fashion designer, {{undertaking}} a course at Central Saint Martins {{which he did not}} complete; from there he worked in retail, first for Prowler and <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> designer Vivienne Westwood. Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a twink bottom for production companies like Eurocreme and UK Naked Men, he starred in such films as Drunk on Spunk and Stretch that Hole, winning numerous awards for his work.

5|$|The track route {{was built}} under {{supervision}} of Sigurd Lund and Carl Venderboe in 1949 and 1950 and subsequently corrected by Cattani. The only fixed installation was a water main which {{ran along the}} track, using Øvresetertjern as its water source. Engineer Luigi Angelini from Switzerland was hired to supervise {{the construction of the}} curves, which cost NOK615,000. The track was first constructed for training in 1951 and <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Olympics in 1952.|$|E

5|$|Unusual for a {{television}} series, the sound team receives {{a rough cut}} of a full season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has {{been in charge of}} sound since <b>then.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a chamois. For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|Anggun is the Asian {{artist with}} the highest album sales outside Asia, with her {{releases}} being certified gold and platinum in some European countries.

5|$|Former England captain Bryan Robson {{took over}} as new manager during the {{following}} season, but, under his management, City won only seven games from 28 and were relegated in 23rd place. Robson left {{and was replaced by}} his assistant Colin Todd. The club went into administration for a second time, but Todd led them to 11th in each of the following two seasons. Following fan pressure and a poor run of results, Rhodes sacked Todd on 12 February 2007, with City just three points above the relegation zone. Wetherall was appointed player-manager on a temporary basis and <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the season, but City were relegated following a 3–0 defeat to Chesterfield. During the summer of 2007, former midfielder Stuart McCall returned as manager with City in the bottom tier {{for the first time in}} 25years. He set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season, but twice missed out on promotion before he left the club in February 2010 with City lying 16th in League Two.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} {{radio-control}} equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and <b>then</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E
