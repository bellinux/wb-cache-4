The song was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Tennessee in 2011. A snippet of the song premiered on July 15, 2011 on MTV News, three {{months prior to the}} release of its album, Evanescence. During an interview Lee said, [...] "That's the one <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> cry ... like, literally, just in here, working on it, there have been tears." [...] At first, Lee anticipated that the song would become a B-side at most, thinking of the song as too personal for an album track.|$|E
500|$|Aside from touring, Korn also {{released}} three singles {{following the}} album's release. [...] "No Place to Hide" [...] was the album's first single. The single features the song [...] "Proud", {{a song that}} was previously unreleased. Other versions include both original and remixed versions of songs featured on Korn.]. Amazon. Retrieved 2010-02-20. The song [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] was released as a single on March 4, 1997. The song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said that [...] "It {{was one of the}} hardest videos we ever made because we all had to lie still on cold metal slabs for hours, pretending to be dead. We wore dirty blue contacts in our eyes <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> partially blind while they were in." ...|$|E
500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. [...] "The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All our equipment had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which meant we had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> a close film family." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} then filmed in Budapest, Hungary over several days. [...] "The {{reason for the}} {{location}} stems from the music in the actual video. The ball needs to bounce synchronized with the 16th or 8th beat in the track. To do that, we needed a space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around. A roof low to the floor but with uprights. Obviously parking lots are ideal. So the location thing happened mainly so it wouldn't fly into the sky. Being connoisseurs of parking lots, {{we wanted to find}} a good example. But it was a technical reason <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> go with it," [...] Knight said. Ne-o used an Arri Super 16mm film camera to shoot the film then edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro, with 3D animation using Autodesk Softimage.|$|E
500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording". [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single [...] "because it was the song <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> want to do a second album. It kept us going and made us think we could still write songs", following [...] "a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after the success of Parachutes.|$|E
500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} premiere a positive review. He praised Williams' performance, stating that she {{brought back a}} [...] "brand of bitchery" [...] that had been missing from the series since Nicollette Sheridan's departure; additionally, he favorably compared the performance to Williams' portrayal of Wilhelmina Slater on Ugly Betty. He also complimented Harriet Sansom Harris' performance, naming her [...] "the creepiest character... {{in the best possible}} way." [...] Stransky called the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline [...] "sweet," [...] but criticized the ridiculousness of Susan's storyline. Neal Justin of the Star Tribune said, [...] "the premiere is packed with the zippy zingers <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> {{fall in love with the}} dramedy in the first place," [...] accrediting the series' improved quality over season six to the return of Mark Moses as Paul Young. He also commented that Vanessa Williams gave [...] "a repeat performance" [...] of her character on Ugly Betty. [...] Damian Holbrook of TV Guide also drew a comparison between Williams' performances in the episode and on Ugly Betty, stating the two characters [...] "have the same stiletto-sharp tongue and prickly chemistry with everyone who enters her orbit." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Knight Ridder Tribune {{wrote that}} the episode's slug [...] "continued the series' fine {{tradition}} of monsters <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> queasy as we squirmed in our seats". Despite enjoying the gore {{and the reality of}} Scully's isolation, the two were critical of the cult's motivations, writing that [...] "we were given absolutely no clue as to why the Utah cult members believed the slug represented the Second Coming of Jesus Christ." [...] The two ultimately concluded that [...] "Roadrunners" [...] fell [...] "well short of a classic." [...] Sarah Stegall highly criticized the episode, calling it [...] "a bad mix of The Fly and , with plenty of X-Files classic paranoia but none of the finesse we've seen before." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, sarcastically referring to Doggett as a [...] "man's man" [...] and the parasite a [...] "phallic-shaped giant slug". Furthermore, she criticized Scully's actions to go off on an assignment without telling her partner. Dave Golder from SFX criticized the episode and called it a retread of the first season episode [...] "Ice".|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> look guilty".|$|E
500|$|After his {{marriage}} to Tameka Foster, the sexual appeal of his artistry was expected to mature as The New Yorker writer Sasha Frere-Jones writes [...] "The challenge here is to convince us {{that he is a}} married and responsible man—grown and sexy, without sacrificing the louche, frictionless sense of play that made him famous." [...] VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, {{he was one of the}} [...] "Sexiest Men" [...] of 2010, and 2011. Celia Walden criticised Usher for being overly explicit, remarking [...] "the subject of his own sexual prowess, women and lingerie will obliterate any traditional interview technique." [...] In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating [...] "The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> question his celebrity status, but over the years this R star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon". In 2013, Complex placed him in its [...] "Most Stylish R Singers of the 90's" [...] list. Men's Health magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue with Lou Schuler calling him [...] "the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry". In 2014 and 2015, his Calvin Klein Collection suits saw him listed as [...] "Best Dressed Men" [...] by various outlets at the Golden Globe Awards and Grammy Awards. InStyle magazine rate him both in their [...] "Hottest Celebrity Abs" [...] collection, and their [...] "37 of the Most Stylish Dads" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|The {{record is}} highly {{regarded}} {{among the members}} of U2. Mullen said, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." [...] Bono called the album a [...] "pivot point" [...] in the band's career, saying, [...] "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're still here now." [...] Clayton concurred, saying, [...] "If we hadn't done something we were excited about, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened." [...] The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by [...] "set themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs, writing that the album helped U2 avoid [...] "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions". AllMusic called the album [...] "a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor". A 2010 retrospective by Spin said that [...] "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with Achtung Baby." ...|$|E

500|$|In Entertainment Weekly, Alejandro Garay wrote, [...] "One of my {{favorite}} episodes of 2008 was Lost’s 'The Constant.' [...] It was a beautiful episode <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> fans {{fall in love with}} the show even more. [...] The creators managed to build momentum with smart narrative, by using the romance card to develop such a complicated topic as time traveling. [...] It was exquisite, mind-blowing, impeccably done, and unforgettable." [...] Bill Keveney of USA Today wrote that it is [...] "arguably the most highly praised episode of [...] well-received fourth season", while his colleague Robert Bianco deemed Henry Ian Cusick worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times called the episode a [...] "mind-blowing tour de force". [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "for-the-ages episode" [...] with [...] "a classic Lost moment" [...] in Desmond and Penny's phone call and [...] "an especially spine-tingling performance" [...] by Cusick. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, [...] "last night's forty-four minutes of Lost were among the most satisfying forty-four minutes in front of the tube in my life." [...] He added that [...] "it wasn't merely a brilliant episode, which pushed the mythology forward more rapidly and richly than any episode in my memory, but it was an emotional release … I actually cried when Penny and Desmond finally…connected" [...] and [...] "there wasn't one, single, solitary false note". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "it was brilliantly executed, as both a brain-twister and as a love story" [...] with an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance by Jeremy Davies. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "the best single outing since season 1's 'Walkabout'" [...] and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet-to-air season finale. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described [...] "The Constant" [...] as [...] "mindblowing" [...] and cited it as [...] "the reason the hardcore fans love Lost." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that [...] "the time-tripping went into overdrive with this week's brilliant episode … [...] worked beautifully as a showcase for Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented Desmond.

According to Susanne Bobzien, the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias (third century CE); [...] "what makes us have control over things {{is the fact that we}} are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".|$|E
