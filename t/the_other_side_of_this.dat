The {{lyrics of}} the album focus on real world events, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. According to McIlrath, although the lyrics discuss grim topics, they actually take on a positive view and were written from the perspective of: [...] "What if the place on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> transition is a place we'd all rather be living in?" [...] On January 12, 2011, Rise Against announced the release date of Endgame as March 15, 2011. Although Spin Magazine labeled Endgame as a concept album, on January 7, 2011, McIlrath tweeted a clarifying message stating that [...] "the record is not a concept record and, fret not, has {{absolutely nothing to do}} with the Dixie Chicks." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Help Is on the Way", debuted on KROQ on January 17. A second song from the album, [...] "Architects", was debuted and released digitally on February 15. As a promotion effort, the band embarked on a short tour of South America in February and then a month-long tour of Europe in March. Upon returning to the United States, the band announced a U.S. spring tour with Bad Religion and Four Year Strong.|$|E

[...] Marks became convinced (but was unable to prove) that their agents in the Netherlands had been compromised by the German counter-intelligence Abwehr.

Marks's warnings fell on deaf ears and perhaps as many as 50 further agents were sent to meet their deaths in Holland. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story was published in 1953 by Marks's German opposite number in the Netherlands, Hermann Giskes, in his book London Calling North Pole.|$|E

After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey {{would be willing to}} perform the stuntwork himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg.

2500|$|John Gay and Alexander Pope {{belong on}} one side of a line {{separating}} the celebrants of the individual and the celebrants of the social. [...] Pope wrote The Rape of the Lock, he said, to settle a disagreement between two great families, to laugh them into peace. [...] Even The Dunciad, which seems to be a serial killing of everyone on Pope's enemies list, sets up these figures as expressions of dangerous and antisocial forces in letters. [...] Theobald and Cibber are marked by vanity and pride, by having no care for morality. The hireling pens Pope attacks mercilessly in the heroic games section of the Dunciad are all embodiments of avarice and lies. [...] Similarly, Gay writes of political society, of social dangers, and of follies that must be addressed to protect the greater whole. [...] Gay's individuals are microcosms of the society at large. [...] On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> line were people who agreed with the politics of Gay and Pope (and Swift), but not in approach. They include, early in the Augustan Age, James Thomson and Edward Young.|$|E
