Written and directed by Monte Hellman, it featured an unidentified official (Harry Dean Stanton) offering the Man With No Name a chance at a pardon in exchange for cleaning up <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> <b>in</b> San Miguel. Close-ups of Eastwood's face from archival footage are inserted into the scene alongside Stanton's performance.

Bree revealed to Vinnie that her qualifications as a surgeon were dodgy and alerted Brooke. However instead of deepening the rival between the two, it only forced the two closer together.

Brooke decides she is going to take Bree under her wing and help her out of <b>the</b> <b>mess.</b> <b>In</b> many ways Bree becomes Brooke's little protege. I think they've both had the chance to let their guard down with one another. Now that Brooke has seen Bree at her lowest – desperate and vulnerable – it has endeared her to Brooke." ...|$|E
