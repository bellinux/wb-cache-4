25|$|Extension × intension = information. Two {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} sign relation, necessary though insufficient, {{are the way}} of extension (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of intension (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of information, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.|$|E

25|$|Still, {{it may be}} doubted {{whether this}} {{multiplication}} of fast-days can {{be taken as a}} sign of an increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of Robertson Smith (The Religion of the Semites, p.413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly it does for the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to eat too late a meal {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath-day, so as to enjoy all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of evolution {{in most cases}} has been gene duplication in tissues unrelated to the venom, followed by expression of the new protein in the venom gland. This was followed by natural selection for adaptive traits following the birth-and-death model, where duplication is followed by functional diversification, resulting {{in the creation of}} structurally related proteins that have slightly different functions. The study of venom evolution has been a high priority for scientists in terms of scientific research. This is due to medical relevance of snake venom, in terms of making anti-venom and cancer research. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> is known about the composition of venom and the ways it can potentially evolve is very beneficial. There are three main factors that affect venom evolution that have been closely studied: predators of the snake that are resistant to snake venom, prey that are in an evolutionary arms race with snakes, and the specific diets that affect intraspecific evolution of venom. Venoms continue to evolve as specific toxins are modified to target a specific prey, and it is found that toxins vary according to diet in some species.|$|E
25|$|Fellowships (including {{those found}} in raids) can use the Fellowship Manoeuvre system to perform special group moves. Fellowship Manoeuvres occur {{randomly}} and require that the target be stunned or knocked down, in any group encounter with a 'signature' or higher enemy. Burglars and Guardians also have special skills that can initiate FMs when triggered. When the FM is initiated, every player within the area will get a color wheel on their screen to choose one of four skill contributions. These skill contributions are Ent's Strength, which deals direct damage, Stallions Spirit, which restores power, Spider's Guile, which deals direct and periodic damage, and Eagle's Cry, which restores lost morale. Every player can select one of these four contributions when a Fellowship Manoeuvre has been engaged, and the effect upon the target(s) intensifies <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> it has been selected. There are also Fellowship Manoeuvres which can be selected by a fellowship leader or assistant which confer unique bonuses. There are dozens of these unique FM combinations, which are designed for different situations and fellowship sizes.

As early as 2001, Blumenthal created savoury ice cream flavours such as mustard grain and crab. Blumenthal, in an article explaining the concept of [...] "flavour encapsulation", explained that flavour is much more intense in encapsulated bursts, rather than when dispersed in a solution; therefore, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> eggs are cooked, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> the proteins stick together.

[...] In fact they could be considered the epitome of Fisher's belief in the paramount importance of speed over everything else. Fisher's adherence to this principle is highlighted in a letter he wrote to Churchill concerning the battleships of the 1912–13 Naval Estimates. In the letter, dated April 1912, Fisher stated: [...] "There must be sacrifice of armour ... There must be further VERY GREAT INCREASE IN SPEED ... your speed must vastly exceed [...] your possible enemy!" ...|$|E
500|$|When Bacon {{undertook}} {{the series}} late in 1948, he {{was something of}} a two-hit wonder. He had had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{and to a lesser extent}} with Painting (1946), both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist. The exhibition was a success, and marked his critical breakthrough. Until then, he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance. While some found his images horrifying and unnerving, they wrote about him all the same, sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post-war British art. The critic for The Observer wrote, [...] "The recent paintings... horrifying as they are, cannot be ignored. Technically they are superb, and the masterly handling of large areas of pearly grey, flushed with a sudden pink or green, only makes me regret <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> the artist's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric".|$|E

500|$|Cliff Fletcher, who drafted {{him into}} the NHL, {{described}} Nieuwendyk as being a [...] "pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons", adding that [...] "{{he had a great}} stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he had everything you needed to have. History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> was on the line in big games, the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|E
500|$|According to Fedor Kondratev, {{an expert}} of the Serbsky Center and {{supporter}} of Snezhnevsky {{and his colleagues}} who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s, those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes. It was they who began to be searched for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization {{as a result of}} the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the [...] "exclusively scientific" [...] concept of Marxism–Leninism. This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization. In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave [...] "in a different way than others do" [...] not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience. It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] of his dissent. Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all <b>the</b> <b>more,</b> <b>that</b> one needed to administer compulsory treatment [...] "for it" [...] in special psychiatric hospitals. What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their [...] "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks. Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.|$|E

He told his people that the Israelites had become too numerous and required shrewd dealing, lest they multiply and in a war join Egypt's enemies. So the Egyptians set taskmasters over the Israelites to afflict them with burdens – and the Israelites built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses – but <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>that</b> the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied.

2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading.

Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

Wace and F.H. Stebbings, eds. (New York/London: Macmillan 1962). The particular narrative [...] of the Iliad is not an account of the war, but a tale of the psychology, the wrath, vengeance and death of individual heroes, which assumes common knowledge of the Trojan War as a back-story. No scholars now assume that the individual events of the tale (many of which involve divine intervention) are historical fact; however, no scholars claim that the story is entirely devoid of memories of Mycenaean times.|$|E
