5|$|The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Seven Days Battles {{was shown}} clearly as both capitals, Washington and Richmond, set up {{numerous}} provisional hospitals <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dead, wounded and missing. Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded. Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the Seven Days, and the immense {{number of casualties}} overwhelmed hospitals and doctors. People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conflict's casualties. Graves could not be dug quickly enough.|$|E
5|$|A {{footbridge}} {{crossing the}} River Pinn and leading to Long Meadow was replaced in 2007; the original {{had been built}} in 1977. In 2008, the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens was formed <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gardens and ensure they remain protected. The group received a £24,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund for the replanting of the gardens, which went ahead in April 2010. The Mayor of Hillingdon officially reopened the gardens on 17 July 2010.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1879-1880, {{extended}} periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands. Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor), helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> needs of such a large population. The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E

5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E

5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred {{throughout the history of}} apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|E

5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not}} clear how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Ramakrishna {{developed}} throat cancer, and {{was transferred}} to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi. Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader.

5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor and needy. They also called {{for the creation of}} the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E
