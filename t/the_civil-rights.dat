5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift for the English language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, Hand {{was viewed as a}} liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty, sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> activism of the 1950s Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.|$|E

25|$|On October 18, 2006, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle set a trial date of April 16, 2007. In {{the same}} ruling, the judge {{dismissed}} <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> and conspiracy {{charges against the}} Department of Juvenile Justice and Bay County Sheriff's Office, and ruled {{that they would not}} be responsible for punitive damages.|$|E

50|$|Constancia had {{two sons}} from her {{relationship}} with <b>the</b> African-American <b>civil-rights</b> activist James Forman; thus Romilly has two grandsons, James Robert Lumumba Forman Jr., a professor at Yale Law School, and Chaka Esmond Fanon Forman, an actor.|$|R
50|$|The men's bodies {{remained}} undiscovered for 44 days. In the meantime, {{the case}} of <b>the</b> missing <b>civil-rights</b> workers became a major national story, especially coming on top of other events during Freedom Summer. The federal government quickly assigned the FBI to a full investigation, and called in Navy sailors and other forces {{to aid in the}} search.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>civil-rights</b> {{movement}} on campus also picked up momentum and visibility. In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan's retirement, Mexican-American and African-American student organizations presented {{a list of}} demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees. The demonstrators' occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan's home. Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was quite}} {{familiar}} with the procedural tactic, as he {{played a role in}} a similar tactic against the civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier. In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> bill was withdrawn. Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> claim {{included}} {{a violation of}} Section 1983, the city successfully petitioned for removal to federal court. After the Rasmussens stipulated to dropping the federal claim with prejudice, {{they were allowed to}} refile an amended claim in state court, which they did at the beginning of 2011. In state court, the city was found to be immune from liability for all of the claims except the civil rights violation. When the Rasmussens filed an amended complaint restricting it to only the civil rights claim, the judge dismissed it in August because he believed that their stipulation in federal court earlier barred them from doing so.|$|E
50|$|After 1945, Brown {{continued}} to run alone {{what was the}} only African-American newspaper in Omaha. It became the only newspaper of the African-American community in the state. She used its influence for education, community building, supporting <b>the</b> national <b>civil-rights</b> movement and opening up jobs for blacks. In the 1960s President Lyndon Johnson appointed her as a goodwill ambassador to East Germany.|$|R
2500|$|The most fervent {{opposition}} to the bill came from Senator Strom Thurmond (D-SC): [...] "This so-called Civil Rights Proposals, which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend {{beyond the realm of}} reason. This is <b>the</b> worst <b>civil-rights</b> package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the Reconstruction proposals and actions of the radical Republican Congress." ...|$|R
50|$|Rowena Moore (September 10, 1910 - December 15, 1998) was an African-American {{union and}} civic activist, {{and founder of}} the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation in Omaha, Nebraska. She led the effort to have the Malcolm X House Site {{recognized}} for its association with the life of <b>the</b> national <b>civil-rights</b> leader. It was listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and the Nebraska register of historic sites.|$|R
500|$|Kahn (along with Horowitz and Norman Hill) helped Rustin and A.Philip Randolph to {{plan the}} 1963 March on Washington, at which Martin Luther King, Jr. {{delivered}} his [...] "I have a dream" [...] speech. For this march, Kahn also ghost wrote the speech of A.Philip Randolph, the senior leader of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> movement and the African-American labor movement. Kahn's analysis of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> movement influenced Bayard Rustin (who was the nominal author of Kahn's1964–1965 essay [...] "Fromprotest topolitics"), Stokely Carmichael, [...] and WilliamJulius Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Tom Kahn was [...] "very goodlooking, a very {{attractive}} guy" [...] according to longtime socialist DavidMcReynolds, who is also an openlygay NewYorker. Kahn accepted his homosexuality in1956, the year that Kahn and Horowitz volunteered to help BayardRustin with his work in <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> movement. [...] "Once he met Bayard, then Kahn {{knew that he was}} gay and had this long-term relationship with Bayard, which went through many stages", according to Horowitz, who quoted Kahn's remembrance of Rustin: ...|$|E
500|$|As Obama {{lived in}} Hyde Park, a more {{affluent}} neighborhood {{with a higher}} percentage of White voters {{than the rest of the}} district, the narrative of the race became [...] "the Black Panther against the professor" [...] Obama frequently came off as uptight. Rush criticized Obama: [...] "Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We’re not impressed with these folks with these Eastern elite degrees. Barack is a person who read about <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> protests and thinks he knows all about it." [...] Trotter said, [...] "Barack is viewed in part to be the white man in blackface in our community." [...] Though the Chicago Tribune endorsed Obama, many, including local officials, President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President, endorsed Rush.|$|E
40|$|This {{book review}} engages recent {{scholarship}} on <b>the</b> nature of <b>civil-rights</b> lawyering in <b>the</b> African-American {{bar in the}} generation before Brown v. Board of Education. Using the recent biography of Earl Burrus Dickerson, {{one of the leaders}} of the African-American bar before World War II, the book review finds support for the emerging view that, in the years before Brown, <b>the</b> African-American <b>civil-rights</b> bar was not focused on ending de jure segregation in public institutions, but rather in building up African-American institutions. Contrary to recent scholarship, however, the review suggests that Dickerson personally preferred a more integrationist strategy, and his efforts to build up African-American institutions was less a conscious strategy than a realization of the limitations on his ability to practice law as he wished. Freedom of action, rather than racial equality, was Dickerson 2 ̆ 7 s great motivator...|$|R

5000|$|On his own {{politics}} he stated: [...] "I {{was much}} more an organized political person", he said, adding that from about 1948 to 1962, {{he was a member}} of the Communist Party. [...] "It was an instrument, a radical instrument that could help advance the interests of African-Americans. It helped build <b>the</b> early <b>civil-rights</b> movement and independent trade union movement in the 1930s, '40s and '50s." [...] He said he left the party in 1962 after [...] "it became bureaucratic and corrupt".|$|R
500|$|Robinson's {{major league}} debut brought {{an end to}} {{approximately}} sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line. After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation {{of the military in}} 1948. Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was [...] "a legend and a symbol in his own time", and that he [...] "challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration." [...] According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's [...] "efforts were a monumental step in <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> revolution in America... accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities." ...|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them {{through the use of}} fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case when we walked into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its social implications, the musical integration of soul and country into popular format by Charles changed and revolutionized racial boundaries and restraints in music, {{and contributed to the}} historical Civil Rights Movement. Robert Fontenot of About.com was one of several writers to praise the album's musical and social implications, stating [...] "Arguably one of the most brilliant interpretive albums ever released, it did more to integrate modern American music than almost any other LP in history." [...] In paying tribute to the magazine's selection of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, which had selected Charles at #2, singer-songwriter Billy Joel noted the album's racial and social impact in an article for Rolling Stone, stating [...] "here is a black man giving you the whitest possible music in the blackest possible way, while all hell is breaking loose with the civil rights movement." [...] Another article for Rolling Stone, written in honor of Charles and his achievements, later stated that through his Modern Sounds recordings, Ray Charles [...] "made it acceptable for black people to sing country & western music, in the process doing almost as much to break down racial barriers as did <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> movement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Francis {{called for}} [...] "(1) a {{long-term}} moratorium on all immigration, (2) {{the withdrawal of}} the federal government from involvement in all racial issues, and (3) the repeal of all federal laws and court decisions (including <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> laws of the 1960s and the rulings of the Warren Court) that authorize such involvement." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} 2011 about the {{argument}} that the fight for same-sex marriage is the modern-day equivalent of the civil rights struggle, Barron answered, [...] "I don't consider it <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> issue of our time.

50|$|Independent Institute fellows {{have written}} {{on a variety of}} topics related to civil liberties and human rights. Historian Jonathan Bean anthologized and {{annotated}} numerous historical speeches, letters, and articles that show individualist perspectives that animated <b>the</b> American <b>civil-rights</b> era in his book Race and Liberty in America: The Essential Reader. Since 2012, Bean has served on the Illinois State Advisory Committee, a federally appointed panel that advises the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and his experience led him to claim that the mainstream civil rights community was {{out of touch with the}} public’s civil rights concerns.|$|R

2500|$|... "Respect" [...] has {{appeared}} in dozens of films and still receives consistent play on radio stations. In the 1970s, Franklin's version of the song came to exemplify the feminist movement. Producer Wexler said in a Rolling Stone interview, that Franklin's song was [...] "global in its influence, with overtones of <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> movement and gender equality. It was an appeal for dignity." [...] Although she had numerous hits after [...] "Respect", and several before its release, the song became Franklin's signature song and her best-known recording. I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You was ranked eighty-third in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. A year later, [...] "Respect" [...] was fifth in the magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the GGL’s {{continued}} authority, {{the city}} council was still roundly criticized for not being representative. [...] During <b>the</b> <b>civil-rights</b> furor of the 1960s, the Voting Rights Act signed into law in 1965 required that racial groups be given direct representation by political districts to assure {{the election of a}} member. Significantly, in a split vote on {{the city council}} on whether to accept a Justice Department order to establish an election plan that would provide more access to the Latino community with direct representation, or challenge the order in court, Cisneros voted to accept the order. San Antonio thus moved to single-member directly represented districts in 1977. [...] This led {{to the beginning of the}} end for the GGL and all efforts to rationalize all-city rule.|$|E
