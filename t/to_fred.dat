Serving as the {{terminal}} station of the Drammen Line, Oslo West Station (OsloV) {{was located in}} Vika, {{at the heart of}} the central business district of Oslo. The much larger Oslo East Station (OsloØ) served most commuter, regional and intercity trains. In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was established to look into a possible connection of the Drammen Line to OsloØ. Led by Axel Grenholm, the committee recommended building a branch from the Drammen Line as a tunnel under the city center, allowing all trains would terminate at OsloØ. It was proposed that the tunnel would run from Lassons gate west of OsloV <b>to</b> <b>Fred.</b> Olsens gate, with an intermediate station close to the location of OsloV.|$|E

In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E
5|$|Throughout September10, Fred {{maintained}} Category 2 status before weakening to a Category 1 hurricane.

The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The remnants of Fred persisted for nearly a full week, traveling west-northwest across the Atlantic basin. The remnants finally dissipated on September19. Prior to becoming a tropical depression, the precursor <b>to</b> <b>Fred</b> produced moderate to heavy rainfall in the southern Cape Verde Islands, leading to two flight cancellations and several delays.|$|E

5|$|Under {{threat from}} the {{hurricane}}, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August31, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70percent of the houses in Povoação Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; São Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. Material damage across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related <b>to</b> <b>Fred</b> resulted in nine deaths.|$|E
