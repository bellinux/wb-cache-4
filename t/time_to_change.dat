25|$|On 10 July 1944, a rifle section {{commanded}} by Naik Yeshwant Ghadge came under heavy machine-gun fire {{at close range}} which killed or wounded {{all members of the}} section except the commander. Without hesitation Naik Yeshwant Ghadge rushed the machine-gun position, first throwing a grenade which knocked out the machine-gun and firer and then he shot one of the gun crew. Finally, having no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his magazine, he clubbed to death the two remaining members of the crew. He fell mortally wounded, shot by an enemy sniper.|$|E
25|$|The Franck–Condon principle, in its {{canonical}} form, {{applies only}} {{to changes in the}} vibrational levels of a molecule {{in the course of a}} change in electronic levels by either absorption or emission of a photon. The physical intuition of this principle is anchored by the idea that the nuclear coordinates of the atoms constituting the molecule do not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> during the very brief amount of time involved in an electronic transition. However, this physical intuition can be, and is indeed, routinely extended to interactions between light-absorbing or emitting molecules (chromophores) and their environment. Franck–Condon metaphors are appropriate because molecules often interact strongly with surrounding molecules, particularly in liquids and solids, and these interactions modify the nuclear coordinates of the chromophore in ways closely analogous to the molecular vibrations considered by the Franck–Condon principle.|$|E

25|$|Several minutes later, both forces {{visually}} sighted {{each other}} approximately simultaneously, but both Callaghan and Japanese Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe hesitated on ordering their ships into action. Abe apparently {{was surprised by}} the proximity of the U.S. ships and with decks stacked high with high explosive (vs. armor penetrating) munitions could not decide if he should momentarily withdraw to give his battleships <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> from bombardment ammunition to anti-ship ammunition or to continue onward. He decided to continue onward. Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements, and overall, just delayed too long in acting at all.|$|E
25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley {{would be less}} likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard she would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E
25|$|The band {{opened the}} 1983 Monsters of Rock festival at Donington, and {{supported}} Black Sabbath on their 'Born Again' European tour. After getting dropped by MCA in January 1984 Diamond Head started {{work on their}} fourth studio album, entitled Flight East. Although never released, five tracks (Be Good, A New Messiah, Someone Waiting, Today and Back In The Powerage) emerged on bootleg and shows the band totally changing direction with the dropping of all the characteristic signature guitar solos and heavy dynamic riffs. The change in the band's musical direction was with the duo becoming bored of just playing Heavy Metal and {{felt that it was}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Another change the band made at the time was Brian switching from his Flying V to a Gibson Les Paul. Harris' lyrics had also taken a religious route, as with one of the new songs A New Messiah. After little interest from any record label to pick up the project (and with no money coming in) the band fell apart and in 1985 Tatler and Harris decided to take a break from one another.|$|E

25|$|The Prime Minister nominates the Cabinet, {{traditionally}} {{drawn from}} members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution. Reflecting its monarchical past, Norway was established under the Lutheran Church of Norway, and was the state church until 2012. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of Cabinet be members of the Church of Norway, meaning at least ten out of the 19 ministries. This rule was however removed in 2012. The issue of {{separation of church and state}} in Norway has been increasingly controversial, as many people believe it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.|$|E
25|$|In early 1917, Allenby {{was ordered}} by Haig to start {{preparations}} {{for a major}} offensive around the city of Arras. During his planning Allenby insisted upon putting into practice many of the ideas that his staff officers had offered. Allenby rejected the normal week-long bombardment of the German trenches before making an assault, instead planning on a 48-hour bombardment before the assault went ahead. In addition, Allenby had made careful plans to control traffic in the rear to prevent traffic jams that would block his logistics, a second echelon behind the first echelon that would only be sent in to exploit successes, tunnels to bring up new divisions behind the German lines while avoiding German fire and finally new weapons like tanks and aircraft were to play prominent roles in the offensive. In March 1917, the Germans pulled back to the Hindenburg Line, which led Allenby {{to argue that the}} planned offensive in the Arras sector in April would be changed, a request Haig refused. Despite refusing Allenby's refusal for more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his plans, Haig informed him that the entire responsibility for the failure of the Arras offensive would rest with him. As the Zero Hour for the offensive at 5: 30 am on 9 April 1917 approached, Allenby was thus unusually worried as he knew his entire career was in the balance.|$|E
25|$|Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, {{where they}} sneak inside {{to use a}} {{cauldron}} to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens {{to take them out}} but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida that she should have faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E

50|$|Older drivers {{make more}} {{incorrect}} decisions than younger drivers {{when faced with}} a change in the scene at an intersection. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that older individuals notice change at a slower rate compared to younger individuals. In addition, the location and relevance of changes have an effect on what is noticed while driving. The reaction <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the driver's peripherals is much slower than the reaction <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> that occur towards the center of the driver's visual field. Furthermore, drivers are also able to recognize more relevant <b>changes</b> as opposed <b>to</b> irrelevant ones. Research on the effects of change blindness while driving could provide insight into potential explanations of why car accidents occur.|$|R

According to Copland, ten years had allowed enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> audience perceptions for the better. In his review for The New York Times Harold C. Schonberg wrote that this time, the audience [...] "did not rise in revolt" [...] as it had in 1962. He added, [...] "The composer's cause was helped by, if memory serves, a better performance than had been given in 1962. Mr. Boulez revels in this kind of music, and he brought drama to it as well as a synthesizing quality." ...|$|E

Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice {{decided that it}} was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida.

The track was mixed by Demacio 'Demo' Castellon for The Demolition Crew, and recorded by Angie Teo. Editing for the track {{was completed by}} Stephen 'The Koz' Kozmeniuk for The Demolition Crew. The song makes references to historical figures including Marlon Brando, James Dean, Al Capone, Bruce Lee, Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln and John Travolta. Billboards Keith Caulfied noted dubstep influences during the bridge, and like other songs on MDNA, [...] "Superstar" [...] takes <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the composition into a fast-paced track. According to Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph, the composition features a [...] "shimmering ambiance built up from a ringing guitar loop and echoing tom-tom pattern {{that might have been}} constructed from Beatles' drum fills." [...] Along with the looping music, the lyrics are simple and obtuse in nature, which McCormick believed was done deliberately like [...] "You can have the password to my phone / I'll give you a massage when you get home".

Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man—along with Linda—is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar. On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes. Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya. When law-enforcement officers appear {{at the back of the}} venue, Mac quickly starts a small fire onstage and Linda hollers [...] "FIRE!", emptying the venue and allowing the group to escape via backstage (yet somehow finding <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> into tuxedoes first).
