5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Two {{men could}} empty a wagon in one minute, one to run <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> {{on and off}} the cradle, and another to operate the hydraulics.|$|E
5|$|Using {{hydraulic}} power, {{the cradle}} was tilted to an angle, so the coal {{ran out of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and down a coal chute into the hold of the vessel below.|$|E
30|$|The {{on-board}} {{intelligence of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{will include a}} GPS location module and a data logger, so that <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> can be located easily. Due to the exact information about the position of <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> they can be dispatched more easily. Thus, together with the new integrated business model, the round trip times of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> from nowadays approximately 3  days shall be reduced to 2  days. Furthermore the mileage counting will facilitate a mileage-based maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|They then charged <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> {{and were}} stopped {{from getting into}} <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{after a series of}} mounted counter charges by several men of <b>the</b> party. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> were maneuvered into a circle, and the {{settlers}} withstood a siege that lasted the remainder of the day. Eventually the Apaches took to the surrounding slopes, firing both arrows and bullets at long range.|$|R
50|$|The ECPB {{can also}} apply {{the brakes on}} <b>the</b> {{rearmost}} <b>wagons,</b> slightly before <b>the</b> brakes on <b>the</b> front <b>wagons</b> are applied, which reduces the shock and noise of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> bunching up.|$|R
5|$|It was {{restored}} to working order in 1979, winning a conservation award in 1982. The mill is still used to grind wheat flour. A cafe was {{opened in the}} buildings {{which used to be}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> house and stables. Further restoration work, completed in 2007, was funded by the Exmoor Sustainable Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford the costs of <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> teams of oxen, and supplies {{that would be required}} for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

50|$|Eventually <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{had their}} roofs raised; CJ 6 and 14 were the trials for this, {{but it is}} not known by how much the {{capacity}} or weight of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> was increased.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> {{could be}} used for pigs and goats as well as sheep, but the latter was the primary traffic. Because of this <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> often ran in groups, but these were not defined on paper.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, it transpires Gary and Valene have {{separated}} again due to Gary {{falling off}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> Sue Ellen Ewing calls Val {{on behalf of}} Gary, {{to tell her that}} Gary misses her. Val shows up at Southfork with her daughter Lucy, where Gary coldly refuses to return home with her. Val realizes she has returned to Dallas under false pretenses and confronts Sue Ellen, who tells her to resume her relationship with Gary while she still has the chance.|$|E
5|$|In April 1847, chosen {{members of}} the vanguard company gathered, final {{supplies}} were packed, and the group was organized into 14 military companies. A militia and night guard were formed. The company consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight {{members of the}} Quorum of the Twelve, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, draft animals, and livestock, and carried enough supplies to provision the group for one year. On April 5, <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's first fight {{probably}} {{took place}} in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis, after he had unintentionally slighted <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> driver and professional fighter. Jarvis challenged Johnson to fight him {{as a matter of}} honour, and was comprehensively beaten in the resulting match. Johnson's success encouraged him to take up the sport professionally. By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although whether of England or the world is uncertain.|$|E

50|$|Between 1929 and 1934, it is {{believed}} that vans 121-191 and 369-392 were converted to the TFM class; the differences being only two ice hatches placed closer to the ends of <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> and modifications to allow more meat to be held inside <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

5|$|On May 18, 1861, the Hampshire Guards and the Frontier Riflemen {{convened in}} front of the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney before departing to fight in defense of the Confederate States of America.

5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{originally}} had stalls for 116 healthy and 12 ill horses. The stable was insured for 12,000 Norwegian speciedaler, twice the amount {{for the head}} office building. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> depot had space for 28 trams and 16 sleds. The 16 sleds were purchased between 1875 and 1879, and replaced the horsecars during the winter. The forge had space for two smiths and featured a small room where the horses were shoed.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> had bogies altered {{for higher}} speed trains, and so <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> were reclassed MF. This lasted until the 1979 recoding, {{by which time}} only wagons 2-5, 10, 15, 20-22 and 25 remained. These 10 wagons were reclassed to VSBY, {{indicating}} {{that they were not}} bogie-exchangeable.|$|R
50|$|Most of the gable-roof vans were auto-coupled between 1931 and 1933. However, 50 of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were only}} fitted with auto-couplers at one end, {{and this was}} used to semi-permanently couple them in pairs, with the chain {{couplings}} {{on the outside of}} these pairs. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> were relettered to LB, and marked to show they were not to be uncoupled in regular service. This was done to speed up the conversion process. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> were then later fully auto-coupled, and relettered to L. All 50 had been completed by the mid-1950s.|$|R

5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon fell out of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did not arrive {{until the middle of}} February 1847, almost four months after <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. <b>The</b> distribution of <b>wagons</b> to <b>the</b> shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement of <b>the</b> empty <b>wagons.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> trips of <b>the</b> empty <b>wagons</b> have <b>the</b> major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism of wagon distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution of <b>the</b> load <b>wagons</b> and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling of <b>the</b> <b>wagons...</b>|$|R

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E
