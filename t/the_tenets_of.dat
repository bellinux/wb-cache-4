5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|Several modern {{organizations}} {{of various sizes}} claim to follow <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> Thelema. The two most prominent are both organizations that Crowley headed during his lifetime: the A∴A∴, an Order founded by Crowley, based on the grades of the Golden Dawn system; and Ordo Templi Orientis, an order which initially developed from the Rite of Memphis and Mizraim {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and which includes Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica as its religious arm.|$|E
5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> their system of belief.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld. Since the act is widely considered to be criminal by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
25|$|Birth of {{children}} from alien parentage became a problem {{nearing the end of}} the 19th century in controlling population. Gibraltar held <b>the</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> British law, jus soli, making children of aliens born in Gibraltar British by birth, and therefore they became an irremovable liability to the colony. Residents with temporary work permits could have children in Gibraltar and upset the system of exclusion. Therefore, the British administration devised unique methods to circumvent <b>the</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Jus Soli.|$|R

50|$|A noted {{scholar of}} this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha {{maintained}} that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach <b>the</b> <b>tenet</b> <b>of</b> Bhedabheda.|$|R
5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} {{a week in the}} {{religious}} class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{struggled}} {{to conform to}} <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> his parents' Quaker faith; he was hot-tempered and enjoyed brawling from a young age. As he became wealthy later in life, he enjoyed wearing fine clothes, contrary to the Quakers' preference for plain dress. Some of his family's other virtues, such as thrift and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, he adopted early in life. When he turned eighteen, Dow sought to avoid the required militia musters, more out of distaste for the drunkenness that they often involved than out of Quaker belief in pacifism. Instead, he joined the volunteer fire department, whose members were exempted from the muster. In 1827, Dow lobbied the Maine legislature to reform the fire companies to increase their efficiency. That same year, he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration; the members compromised, and served only wine, not hard liquor. At times Dow let his politics interfere with his duties; after being promoted to fire chief, he allowed a liquor store to burn to the ground.|$|E
5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> {{population}} genetics {{since its inception}} has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa {{continued}} his flight southward throughout {{the month of}} January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January {{the pursuit of the}} Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party. On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag. The next day, the Bhagwa Zenda —the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas— was raised in its place. To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with <b>the</b> <b>tenets</b> <b>of</b> any religion. They announced that all Watans, Inams, pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao. During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur.|$|E
