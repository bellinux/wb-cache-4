5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as a cohesive group. Individuals <b>that</b> <b>get</b> detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others <b>that</b> <b>get</b> left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora <b>that</b> <b>get</b> trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E

While she never appears {{in any of the}} one-player {{campaign}} games, she can be purchased as a skin for the Uncharted 2: Among Thieves multiplayer mode. She is voiced by Gwendoline Yeo in the motion comics. Rika saves Nathan's life from two thugs <b>that</b> <b>get</b> in a fight with him in her bar. She then decides to help Drake on his mission to steal the Eye of Indra from Daniel Pinkerton. She double crosses Nathan as well as Eddy leaving with the Eye of Indra. She is the younger sister of Eddy Raja.|$|E

5|$|In {{the video}} game Halo 2 (2004), {{a member of the}} Covenant Prophet triumvirate, Regret, arrives at Earth with a fleet. Most of his fleet is destroyed; Regret's ship flees to another ring, Delta Halo, and is {{followed}} by the human ship In Amber Clad and the Master Chief aboard her. The Chief kills Regret before the majority of the Covenant fleet arrives at Delta Halo, along with the Covenant's holy city of High Charity. The death of Regret leads the remaining Prophets to promote the Brutes as their guards, replacing the Elites. The Elites, outraged, threaten to resign from the Covenant high council; in turn the Prophets give the Brutes carte blanche to kill the Elites, sparking a civil war. In the midst of these developments, the Flood are again released; the High Prophet Mercy is killed by the parasite, while the last remaining leader, Truth, flees to Earth in a Forerunner ship, entrusting the activation of Halo to the Brute Tartarus. The Elites ally with the humans of In Amber Clad to stop the firing of the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the firing of the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any <b>that</b> <b>get</b> destroyed.|$|E

Since this model is highly provisional, further research is still needed.|$|E

This is suggested by the fact that infants at this age may produce the same sounds differently in different words.|$|E

Tanzania's official report on climate change suggests that the areas that usually get two rainfalls in the year will probably get more, and those <b>that</b> <b>get</b> only one rainy season will get far less.

25|$|Despite the {{potential}} diversity of climates in the ET category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative {{wet and dry}} seasons, this category is rarely subdivided. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure {{of water in the}} chilly atmosphere, but as a rule potential evapotranspiration is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places <b>that</b> <b>get</b> precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes. The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation.|$|E

Other types of pseudofossils are kidney ore (round shapes in iron ore) and moss agates, which look like moss or plant leaves.
