5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. <b>The</b> <b>surgical</b> treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (<b>the</b> <b>surgical</b> removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E

5|$|Although both {{shows are}} set in the same hospital, the Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough to {{encompass}} <b>the</b> <b>surgical</b> ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, so the series was produced at the BBC's Elstree Studios in north London.

McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One.
