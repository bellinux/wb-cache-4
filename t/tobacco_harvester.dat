Lipton operated an experimental tea farm until it was sold in 1987 to Mack Fleming and Bill Hall, who converted the experimental farm into a working tea garden. The Charleston Tea Plantation utilized a converted <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvester</b> to mechanically harvest the tea. The Charleston Tea Plantation sold tea mail order known as American Classic Tea and also produced Sam's Choice Instant Tea, sold through Sam's Clubs. American Classic Tea has been the official tea of the White House since 1987. [...] Losing money and nearly bankrupt, in 2003 the plantation was sold to Bigelow Tea Company at a court auction for $1.28 million and was temporarily closed for renovation in order to attract tourists and boost its revenues. The garden reopened in January 2006 and gives free tours to the public.|$|E

40|$|Background: Eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} comprises a {{group of}} lung diseases in which eosinophils appear in increased numbers in the lungs. The distinct etiology of eosinophilic pneumonia is unknown, although the previous case series have indicated a relationship between acute eosinophilic pneumonia and the exposure to exogenous substances including the constituents of cigarettes. Case Summary: A 60 -year-old nonsmoking female, who had started to harvest and sort tobacco leaves two months before presentation, was admitted because of persistent coughing, breathlessness, and general malaise. Her laboratory findings revealed eosinophilia. Chest computed tomography showed nonsegmental airspace consolidations bilaterally. A bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis also revealed that the numbers of total cells and eosinophils had increased. Although the urine level of cotinine was within the normal range, positive findings {{were found in the}} skin scratch-patch tests using tobacco leaf and its extracts, and a biopsy specimen obtained from the positive site demonstrated infiltration of eosinophils in the dermis. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids. Discussion: Green tobacco sickness, a type of nicotine poisoning caused by the dermal absorption of nicotine, is a well known occupational illness of tobacco harvesters. Although it is unclear whether the present case could be identified as a subtype of green tobacco sickness, this is the first report of eosinophilic pneumonia occurred in a <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvester</b> which was possibly induced by tobacco leaf exposure...|$|E

50|$|People who harvest or {{cultivate}} tobacco {{may experience}} Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS), {{a type of}} nicotine poisoning caused by skin contact with wet tobacco leaves. This occurs most commonly in young, inexperienced <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvesters</b> who do not consume tobacco.|$|R
50|$|Worldwide {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 33 million tobacco farm workers, with a substantial proportion living in developing countries. A recent international review reported that between 8-89% of <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvesters</b> may be affected {{in the course of a}} season (this wide variation probably being due to differences between study methodologies as well as a range of working conditions). The long-term health outcomes for individuals exposed to nicotine transdermally for extended periods of time are not known.|$|R
50|$|Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS) {{is a type}} of {{nicotine}} poisoning caused by the transdermal absorption {{of nicotine}} from the surface of wet <b>tobacco</b> plants. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>harvesters,</b> whose clothing becomes saturated from tobacco wet with rain or morning dew, are at high risk of developing GTS. Workers can avoid getting this sickness by waiting to harvest until the tobacco leaves are dry, or by wearing a rain suit. Wet clothing that has come in contact with tobacco leaves should be removed immediately and the skin washed with warm soapy water.|$|R
40|$|Tobacco {{and tobacco}} smoke are {{strongly}} associated with various skin conditions, among which contact dermatitis is of prime importance. The aetiological and clinical aspects {{vary according to the}} different tobacco production and processing steps. Contact dermatitis is frequent in <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvesters,</b> curers and cigar makers, whereas it rarely affects smokers and, only exceptionally, cigarette packaging workers. The skin sites involved also vary, according to whether the exposure is occupational or non-occupational. Tobacco contact irritation is far more frequent than contact allergy. The sensitizing compound in tobacco is unknown; nicotine, while highly toxic, does not seem to cause sensitization, except in rare cases. Besides natural substances, several compounds are added to tobacco during processing and manufacturing. For this reason, identifying the aetiological factors is exceedingly difficult. Another important aspect to take into account is the co-causative role of tobacco in eliciting or exacerbating contact dermatitis in response to other agents, occupational or extra-occupational...|$|R
50|$|At high-enough doses, it is {{associated}} with nicotine poisoning. Today nicotine is less commonly used in agricultural insecticides, which was a main source of poisoning. More recent cases of poisoning typically {{appear to be in}} the form of Green Tobacco Sickness or due to accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products or ingestion of nicotine containing plants. People who harvest or cultivate tobacco may experience Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS), a type of nicotine poisoning caused by dermal exposure to wet tobacco leaves. This occurs most commonly in young, inexperienced <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvesters</b> who do not consume tobacco. People can be exposed to nicotine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nicotine exposure in the workplace as 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At environmental levels of 5 mg/m3, nicotine is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|R
40|$|NIOSH {{warns that}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{may be at}} {{increased}} risk for developing green tobacco sickness (GTS) which is a form of nicotine (54115) poisoning. A total of 47 persons with GTS were identified during 2 months in 1992 after seeking emergency treatment in a five county area of Kentucky. Nicotine can be absorbed from the wet tobacco surface through the skin of the workers. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe weakness with changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Abdominal cramping, headaches and difficulty in breathing were frequently reported. Recommendations offered to help workers avoid this problem included not working in wet tobacco, wearing protective clothing which may reduce the amount of nicotine absorbed through the skin such as chemical resistant gloves and plastic aprons, changing to dry clothing as quickly as possible once clothes have become wet, and informing the doctor of nicotine exposure if the worker does become ill which will assist in obtaining a correct diagnosis more quickly. Since the symptoms are easily confused with those resulting from exposure to organophosphorus compounds, the correct diagnosis may be difficult to obtain. OtherOccupational Healt...|$|R

This year's theme is "Hands Across the Nation for Preschool Immunization. " Events will encourage cooperation between health-care providers and parents to ensure that children are enrolled with a private physician, public clinic, or other health-care facility that will screen and track their vaccination needs to ensure they receive all recommended vaccinations by their second birthday. Local programs are encouraged to participate in NPIW by tailoring activities to fit their communities' needs.

5000|$|Some farmers {{still use}} [...] "tobacco harvesters". They {{are not very}} {{efficient}} yet highly cost effective for harvesting premium and rare strains of <b>tobacco.</b> The <b>harvester</b> trailers for in-demand crops are now pulled by diesel fueled tractors. [...] "Croppers" [...] or [...] "primers" [...] pull the leaves off in handfuls and pass these to the [...] "stringer" [...] or [...] "looper", which bundles the leaves to a four-sided pole with twine. These poles are hung until the harvester is full. The poles are then placed in a much larger wagon to be pulled by modern farm tractors to their destination. For rare tobaccos they are often cured on the farm. Traditionally, the slaves who cropped and pulled had a particularly tough time with the first pull of the large, dirty, base leaves. The leaves slapped their faces and dark tobacco sap, which dries into a dark gum, covered their bodies, and then soil stuck to the gum.|$|R
