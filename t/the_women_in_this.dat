2500|$|Kemi Filani {{commented on}} the {{positive}} portrayal {{of women in the}} film: [...] "I love the way women were portrayed. For a change, Nigerian women were strong, smart and beautiful. Although <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> film are flawed, like every other human being, they were also shown to be inherently good and beautiful." [...] Dami Elebe commended the acting skills of the two lead actors in the film: [...] "Nse Ikpe-Etim executed her role in this movie with precision, perfect pronunciation and class. Wale Ojo is not the typical Nollywood leading man. He is not the hot young boy we always want to just stare at, but the mature fine man we also want to hear. He blended in his role perfectly and showed that he is not a one movie wonder but an actor who will last a lifetime in Nollywood". Caitlin Pearson commented on Wale Ojo's acting skills by stating: [...] "Ojo definitely impresses with his versatility as an actor in taking up this role, and manages to balance the austere qualities of Akin’s character with a sense of compassion". She also commended Hafiz Oyetoro's character [...] by stating [...] "the most funny and entertaining performance is by Hafiz Oyetoro who plays Akin’s assistant Alex. Alex’s character exists in a fine balance between subservient and sneaky that is pure pleasure to watch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson favored women's {{suffrage}} at {{the state}} level, but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided. The white South was the main center of opposition--only Arkansas gave women voting rights. From 1917 to 1919, a highly visible campaign by the National Woman's Party (NWP) disparaged Wilson and his party for not enacting any amendment on the matter. Wilson did keep in close touch with the much larger and more moderate suffragists of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. He continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was supportive; the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him and he now came out strongly in support of national suffrage in a January 1918 speech to Congress. [...] Applauding the vitality of women during the First World War, he asked Congress, [...] "We have made partners of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> war… Shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?" [...] The House passed a constitutional amendment, but it stalled in the Senate. Wilson continued to speak in its defense, consulting with members of Congress through personal and written appeals, often on his own initiative. Then on June 4, 1919, the proposed amendment prohibiting {{the states and the}} federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex, was approved, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification. [...] It was ratified by the requisite 36 states thanks to Tennessee, and on August 18, 1920, the measure became the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

6000|$|The Marriage in Cana. An immense picture, some twenty-five {{feet long}} [...] by fifteen high, and said by Lazari {{to be one}} of the few which [...] Tintoret signed with his name. I am not {{surprised}} at his having done [...] so in this case. Evidently the work has been a favorite with him, and [...] he has taken as much pains as it was ever necessary for his colossal [...] strength to take with anything. The subject is not one which admits of [...] much singularity or energy in composition. It was always a favorite [...] one with Veronese, because it gave dramatic interest to figures in gay [...] costumes and of cheerful countenances; but one is surprised to find [...] Tintoret, whose tone of mind was always grave, and who did not like to [...] make a picture out of brocades and diadems, throwing his whole [...] strength into the conception of a marriage feast; but so it is, and [...] there are assuredly no female heads in any of his pictures in Venice [...] elaborated so far as those which here form the central light. Neither [...] is it often that the works of this mighty master conform themselves to [...] any of the rules acted upon by ordinary painters; but in this instance [...] the popular laws have been observed, and an academy student would be [...] delighted to see with what severity the principal light is arranged in [...] a central mass, which is divided and made more brilliant by a vigorous [...] piece of shadow thrust into the midst of it, and which dies away in [...] lesser fragments and sparkling towards the extremities of the picture. [...] This mass of light is as interesting by its composition as by its [...] intensity. The cicerone who escorts the stranger round the sacristy in [...] the course of five minutes, and allows him some forty seconds for the [...] contemplation of a picture which the study of six months would not [...] entirely fathom, directs his attention very carefully to the [...] "bell' [...] effetto di prospettivo," [...] the whole merit of the picture being, in the [...] eyes of the intelligent public, that there is a long table in it, one [...] end of which looks farther off than the other; but there is more in [...] the [...] "bell' effetto di prospettivo" [...] than the observance of the common [...] laws of optics. The table is set in a spacious chamber, of which the [...] windows at the end let in the light from the horizon, and those in the [...] side wall the intense blue of an Eastern sky. The spectator looks all [...] along the table, at the farther end of which are seated Christ and the [...] Madonna, the marriage guests on each side of it,--on one side men, on [...] the other women; the men are set with their backs to the light, which [...] passing over their heads and glancing slightly on the tablecloth, [...] falls in full length along the line of young Venetian women, who thus [...] fill the whole centre of the picture with one broad sunbeam, made up [...] of fair faces and golden hair. Close to the spectator a woman has [...] risen in amazement, and stretches across the table to show the wine in [...] her cup to those opposite; her dark red dress intercepts and enhances [...] the mass of gathered light. It is rather curious, considering the [...] subject of the picture, that one cannot distinguish either the bride [...] or the bridegroom; but the fourth figure from the Madonna in the line [...] of women, who wears a white head-dress of lace and rich chains of [...] pearls in her hair, may well be accepted for the former, and I think [...] that between her and the woman on the Madonna's left hand the unity of [...] the line of women is intercepted by a male figure; be this as it may, [...] this fourth female face is the most beautiful, as far as I recollect, [...] that occurs in the works of the painter, with the exception only of [...] the Madonna in the [...] "Flight into Egypt." [...] It is an ideal which occurs [...] indeed elsewhere in many of his works, a face at once dark and [...] delicate, the Italian cast of feature moulded with the softness and [...] childishness of English beauty some half a century ago; but I have [...] never seen the ideal so completely worked out by the master. The face [...] may best be described as one of the purest and softest of Stothard's [...] conceptions, executed with all the strength of Tintoret. The other [...] women are all made inferior to this one, but there are beautiful [...] profiles and bendings of breasts and necks along the whole line. The [...] men are all subordinate, though there are interesting portraits among [...] them; perhaps the only fault of the picture being that the faces are a [...] little too conspicuous, seen like balls of light among the crowd of [...] minor figures which fill the background of the picture. The tone of [...] the whole is sober and majestic in the highest degree; the dresses are [...] all broad masses of color, and the only parts of the picture which lay [...] claim to the expression of wealth or splendor are the head-dresses of [...] <b>the</b> <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> respect the conception of the scene differs widely [...] from that of Veronese, and approaches more nearly to the probable [...] truth. Still the marriage is not an unimportant one; an immense crowd, [...] filling the background, forming superbly rich mosaic of color against [...] the distant sky. Taken as a whole, the picture is perhaps the most [...] perfect example which human art has produced of the utmost possible [...] force and sharpness of shadow united with richness of local color. In [...] all the other works of Tintoret, and much more of other colorists, [...] either the light and shade or the local color is predominant; in the [...] one case the picture has a tendency to look as if painted by [...] candle-light, in the other it becomes daringly conventional, and [...] approaches the conditions of glass-painting. This picture unites [...] color as rich as Titian's with light and shade as forcible as [...] Rembrandt's, and far more decisive.|$|E
