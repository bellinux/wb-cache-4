40|$|We study {{particle}} clustering in {{a temperature}} stratified turbulence with small finite correlation time. It is {{shown that the}} temperature stratified turbulence strongly increases the degree of compressibility of particle velocity field. This results in the strong decrease of the threshold for the excitation of <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability even for small particles. <b>The</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability in the temperature stratified turbulence is essentially different from the inertial clustering instability that occurs in non-stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. While the inertial clustering instability {{is caused by the}} centrifugal effect of the turbulent eddies, the mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is related to the temperature fluctuations generated by <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> of <b>the</b> mean temperature gradient by the velocity fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations produce pressure fluctuations and cause particle clustering in regions with increased pressure fluctuations. It is shown that the growth rate of <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is much larger than that of the inertial clustering instability. It is found that depending on the parameters of the turbulence and the mean temperature gradient there is a preferential particle size at which the particle clustering due to <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is more effective. The particle number density inside the cluster after the saturation of this instability can be in several orders of magnitude larger than the mean particle number density. It is also demonstrated that the evaporation of droplets drastically change <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability, e. g., it increases the instability threshold in the droplet radius. <b>The</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is of a great importance, e. g., in atmospheric turbulence with temperature inversions.

40|$|Consider three qubits A, B, and C {{which may}} be {{entangled}} with each other. We {{show that there is}} a trade-off between A’s entanglement with B and its entanglement with C.

25|$|As Grant's plan {{became clear}} to Lee on May 4, Lee {{knew that it was}} {{imperative}} to fight in the Wilderness for the same reason as the year before: his army was massively outnumbered, with approximately 65,000 men to Grant's 120,000, and his artillery's guns were fewer than and inferior to those of Grant's. Fighting in <b>the</b> <b>tangled</b> woods would eliminate Grant's advantage in artillery, and the close quarters and ensuing confusion there could give Lee's outnumbered force better odds. He therefore ordered his army to intercept the advancing Federals in the Wilderness. Ewell marched east on the Orange Court House Turnpike, reaching Robertson's Tavern, where they camped about 3–5 miles from the unsuspecting soldiers in Warren's corps. Hill used the Orange Plank Road and stopped at the hamlet of New Verdiersville. These two corps could pin the Union troops in place (they had been ordered to avoid a general engagement until the entire army could be united), fighting outnumbered for at least a day while Longstreet approached from the southwest for a blow against the enemy's flank, similar to Jackson's at Chancellorsville.|$|E

An appeal to the Supreme Court brought further delays, but finally the case was opened on February 14, 1689. The judges rendered their individual opinions on March 14, and judgment was finally pronounced on March 21. The sentence was not a surprise to those who had followed the case. After a fair, impartial trial Gabriel Milan was found guilty and condemned to lose his property, honor, and life, and his head and hand were to be put upon a stake. A royal pardon saved him from the last grim disgrace, and at dawn on March 26, 1689, he was beheaded on Nytorv Square in Copenhagen.|$|E
