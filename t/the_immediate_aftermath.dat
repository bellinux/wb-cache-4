50|$|Chávez also claimed, during <b>the</b> coup's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> that <b>the</b> U.S. {{was still}} seeking his overthrow.

However, his administration failed to investigate or present conclusive evidence to that effect. During that period, the US Ambassador to Venezuela warned the Chávez administration of two potential assassination plots.|$|R

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of Caracalla's death, Adventus was {{selected}} to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age.

The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus.|$|E
50|$|Trains {{passing through}} Kielce's main railway station were searched for Jews by civilians and SOK railway guard servicemen, {{resulting}} {{in at least}} two passengers being shot or thrown out of the train and killed. As many as 30 more may have been killed in this manner, as the train murders reportedly continued for several months after the pogrom. The large-scale disorder in Kielce ultimately ended some nine hours after it started.

5|$|The war was {{costly for}} Philip and the Macedonians, losing them a fleet {{that had taken}} three years to build as well as {{triggering}} the defection of their Greek allies, the Achean League and the Aetolian League, to the Romans. In <b>the</b> war's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>the</b> Dardani, a barbarian tribe, swarmed across the northern border of Macedon, but Philip was able to repel this attack. In 197, however, Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans {{and was forced to}} surrender. This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans.|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the battle, Herodotus {{says that}} the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.

"Understanding in a Car Crash" [...] is a {{prime example}} of Thursday's style of emotional, poetic lyrics and {{instrumentation}} paired with intense backup screams, heavy chords, and fierce percussion. It begins quickly with matching snare hits immediately followed by a full ensemble led by a dizzying lead guitar and cymbal-crashing introduction. As the verse begins, a somber lead riff takes over backed a steady beat, crooning bass, and melodic, clean vocals detailing <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> physical <b>aftermath</b> of a car wreck. The chorus returns to the introductory heaviness with aggressive, cracked backup vocals, intense drumming, and whirling guitars.|$|R
50|$|On December 26, in <b>the</b> Revolution's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> <b>the</b> new leader, Ion Iliescu, {{formally}} {{named him}} Defense Minister.

Other officers became increasingly uneasy and a pro-reform group, Comitetul de Acţiune pentru Democratizarea Armatei (CADA, Action Committee for the Democratization of the Army) emerged on February 12, 1990. The following day over a thousand soldiers and officers assembled in Bucharest, and Militaru was dismissed on February 16, replaced by General Victor Stănculescu. He ran in the 1996 presidential election, winning 0.22% of the vote. He died of cancer the next month on December 27, 1996.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the plague {{it was at}} a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in <b>the</b> smog's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> Some of <b>the</b> health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|R
5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E

Although a small body of research has explored drivers’ decisions to leave the scene of a road traffic collision (hit-and-run) little research has explored how understanding the processes of hit-and-run collisions could inform prevention strategies.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the executions, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that up to}} 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions.

5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at noon, and the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance was light, with the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops.

Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy.
