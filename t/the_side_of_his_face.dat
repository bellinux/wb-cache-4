5|$|Investigating one of {{a series}} of {{large-scale}} power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with its bright lights. The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

2500|$|Nagase {{was against}} Germany's Dominic Ressel, and again went to ground {{for his first}} attack.

After several tries on the ground, Nagase finally had a {{breakthrough}} with kouchi gaeshi for yuko which he connected to tate shiho gatame for ippon.

2500|$|During the {{penultimate}} episode, Drake asks Hunt if {{he killed}} Sam Tyler, with Hunt explaining that Tyler had been acting [...] "weird" [...] {{and asked for}} Hunt's help in faking his own death. However, the vision that Drake has of the police officer with injuries to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> is connected to Tyler's presumed death, and a roll of undeveloped film apparently reveals where the policeman is supposedly buried. Along with this, Shaz, Ray and Chris all have visions of stars, as if {{looking up at the}} sky, and hear strange voices as described by Chris as Nelson (Tony Marshall), the publican from Life on Mars, asking him what he would like to drink.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was noted}} that Sabrie had been {{carrying}} a ceremonial dagger in his clothing. When the unit {{was ordered to}} bring the dead body of Arush be brought over to {{the same position as}} Sabrie, the soldiers radioed back that they couldn't move the body without it falling apart. So the body of Arush was loaded into a body bag and placed inside a Bison personnel carrier. There, medical technician MCpl Petersen re-opened the bag and took Polaroid photographs for an unknown reason, some suggest to document the shooting, others suggest as a [...] "trophy". [...] The photos showed gaping wounds in Arush's neck and <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> with his skull twisted out of shape by the force of the gunblast. His intestines protruded from his stomach, and his right eye was missing.|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become caked with mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to his casting as Gowron, Robert O'Reilly {{appeared}} in the [...] episode [...] "" [...] as a character referred to as Scarface. When casting was underway for the Jonathan Frakes directed episode [...] "", Frakes was looking for an actor who could portray a Klingon {{with a sense of}} humour. O'Reilly later remarked that he was considered because of what he called [...] "that crazy loon eyeball thing". He went directly from a performance of King Lear where he portrayed the character Edmund, and introduced elements of that character into the Klingon. O'Reilly described Gowron's initial appearances as being [...] "the only one with honor, and he was sort of a crazed warrior {{who did not want to}} be anywhere near 'hew-mons'". He felt that like Edmund, Gowron was an outsider who became a leader. He said that they were [...] "very, very similar in nature", and said that this set the character apart from the other Klingons who had appeared on the show until that point. Michael Westmore was in charge of designing the prosthetics for O'Reilly's performances as Gowron, describing it as one of his favourites of all the Klingons he's worked on because of the beard that comes down <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
