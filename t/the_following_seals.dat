5000|$|The Village of Sheridan {{was settled}} {{as early as}} 1833 when Aaron [...] "Albatross" [...] Stanek and his wife settled on Section 5 and 8 {{in what is now}} Mission Township. Prior to this, in 1826 Jesse Walker {{established}} a mission at the head of Mission Creek, just three miles from the present town of Sheridan. He became the first white settler in what is now Mission Township. In 1834, a Cholera Epidemic swept through the community, with a cemetery South of town, near the present day prison as proof of this event. In 1844 Mission Point was established with the vote for a President and Vice-President. Mission Point became known as Rowe's Station in 1863, the Rowe farm consisted of three houses. Finally, in the summer of 1869 the village was platted and named Sheridan after General Phillip Sheridan. On June 24, 1872, the town of Sheridan voted forty-five to one to incorporate under the Old Statute of the State of Illinois.

40|$|Objectives : The {{aim of this}} {{in-vitro}} {{experimental study}} {{was to assess the}} effect of application of a desensitizing varnish on the enamel and dentin marginal seal. Materials and Methods: Seventy-two freshly extracted, intact human premolar teeth were divided into four groups (n= 18). Class V cavities (3 mm in length, 2 mm in width and 2 mm in depth) were prepared on the buccal surface of each tooth. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>sealing</b> materials were applied in the four groups: One-step Clearfil S 3 Bond (S 3) self-etch adhesive, two-step Clearfil SE Bond (SE) self-etch adhesive, S 3 Bond+ VivaSens desensitizing varnish (VS+S 3) and Clearfil SE Bond + VivaSens (VS+SE). The cavities on the teeth were then incrementally filled with Z 350 light-cure composite. The teeth were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37 °C, and were then thermocycled for 1000 cycles. Then, all the specimens were prepared for dye penetration test and were immersed in 2 % basic fuchsin dye and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. The teeth were then sectioned buccolingually along the center of restorations with a diamond disk.    Microleakage at the tooth-restoration interface was assessed in the enamel and dentin margins blindly using dye penetration under a stereomicroscope at × 20 magnification. Results: There was significantly greater leakage at the enamel and dentin margins in group VS+SE than in group SE; also, these values were higher in group VS+S 3 than in S 3. Conclusion: Combined application of desensitizing varnish and self-etch adhesives seems to increase microleakage in composite restorations. Thus, its application is not suggested. </p...|$|R

40|$|Statement of the problem. Woodworking {{machinery}} is extensively used in {{the production}} of wood components for the construction of objects for various purpose. Operation of woodworking machinery is accompanied by high noise emissions. Circular woodworking machines are the most problematic in terms of their noise characteristics, and also most widespread. The dominating noise source is a saw disk. Results. Vibration-damping structure is suggested in the form of seals with dry friction placed be-tween clamping flanges and a saw disk. Vibration-damping properties of seals are experimentally examined using H. Oberst’s method. The analysis amounted to establishing how the value of the total loss coefficient is affected by <b>the</b> <b>following</b> factors: <b>seal</b> foundation type, frequency of excitation, particles size (dispersion), temperature factor.

Initially, the school directive was to teach German-speaking students to be ministers so that they could speak to German immigrant worshippers in their native tongue; however, with the advent of World War I a name change was deemed prudent by then president, Frank Isaac. The school name was changed in 1917 to the Clinton Theological Seminary. As the war continued, many congregations adopted English as their preferred worship language to show their patriotism and confirm that they had joined in their new society. As the need for German-speaking ministers declined, administrators questioned the need for the school, which competed for the same students as Union College in Lincoln, Nebraska.

40|$|This work {{treats the}} first time {{complement}} of the production of glass - metal - feedthroughs {{by the use of}} an additive process for rapid manufacturing of blanks for sintered glass bodies as well as the adaptation of the upstream and downstream process steps to the resultant change in conditions. With this the conventional process step "pressing" should be replaced in terms of cost and time savings and as part of small series. The selected additive process was powder bed 3 D printing (3 DP). The 3 DP of glass powders in technical applications was a novelty, so that experiences in the field of ceramics allowed the introduction to the problem and their development for glass. The challenge was to maintain comparable properties of the blanks for sintered glass bodies despite {{the differences between the two}} shaping processes pressing and 3 DP. The shaping- pressure used in pressing is not available in 3 DP. Required density and porosity have to be achieved by a suitable particle size distribution of the starting materials. Development of a processing method for glass powder and a binder system of liquid and solid components were important contributions to that. Glasspowder with particle size distributions from < 165 µm with 20 % to 30 % fines (2 - 3 µm) made the best results. The shrinkage of the blanks of sintered glass bodies during the binding and sintering process was 18 % to 20 %. It depends on geometry and allowed the accurate setting of the required CAD data (*. stl). The minimum wall thickness reached by 3 DP of glass rings of powder with above - mentioned properties was 0. 8 mm. The porosity of the sintered glass bodies produced by 3 DP compared with those of the conventional pressing method was 25 % - 40 % to 22 % and the density 1. 7 g / cm³ to 2 g / cm³. These differences had to be compensated by adjusting the dimensions of the blanks in respect of <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>sealing</b> process and <b>the</b> desired properties. Both production methods have form tolerances of 1 to 2 %. The sintered glass bodies produced by 3 DP meet the required quality parameters for glass - metal - feedthroughs and correspond to state of the art after sealing. Based on these results, a stable process chain was given to manufacture glass - metal - feedthroughs with 3 DP manufactured blanks for sintered glass bodies...|$|R
