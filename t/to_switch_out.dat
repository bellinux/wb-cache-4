500|$|The game offers single-player and {{multiplayer}} game modes. Multiplayer allows two players to play alternatively {{in one of}} two different modes: the competitive [...] "Contest" [...] mode or the cooperative [...] "Team" [...] mode. In Contest mode, each player controls a different set of Kongs and take turns playing each level as quickly as possible; the objective is to complete the most levels in the fastest time. In Team mode, each player takes the role of one of the two Kongs and play as a tag team: the active player's Kong will control the progression of the two players while the other player is dormant; the other player takes control if the active player loses his Kong from damage or if the active decides <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
2500|$|High Road to Revenge {{gives the}} player the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> {{of their current}} plane during {{gameplay}} and commandeer additional aircraft on the ground. [...] The player also {{has the ability to}} take control of fixed weapon emplacements, at which time the camera shifts to a first-person view. Turret types include machine guns, flak cannons and rocket launchers. [...] They are found in most of the game's maps, built into the terrain or mounted on vehicles such as Zeppelins.|$|E
50|$|Smaller traversers are {{frequently}} used on roller coasters <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> trains.|$|E
50|$|In Mannheim, {{gauntlet}} {{track is}} used <b>to</b> shift the <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> {{of the road}} <b>to</b> prevent the <b>switch</b> from being driven over by cars and trucks. Mannheim also uses gauntlet track to run trams within less space.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{fitted with}} a Zero 1 decoder {{according}} to Hornby's instructions {{could not be used}} on conventional systems, making it difficult to run locomotives across multiple layouts. It was possible to include a miniature DPDT switch in the installation to enable the Zero 1 decoder <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> for use on a conventional system.|$|R
50|$|As senator, he has {{sponsored}} {{a bill to}} reduce harmful mercury emissions by requiring automobile manufacturers to establish a program <b>to</b> collect mercury <b>switches</b> <b>out</b> of used vehicles to be scrapped or recycled.|$|R
5000|$|Tag Team - Constantly {{changing}} band {{composed of}} members of Umphrey's McGee, Moe, and Tea Leaf Green. Band members would [...] "tag" [...] each other when they wanted <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> with someone playing on stage.|$|E
5000|$|The game also {{includes}} the option to customize the titular Metal Slug to their own liking, with the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> its [...] "core," [...] treads, weapons, and armor. An in-game laboratory {{can be used to}} build custom parts for the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The two {{advantages}} {{available in}} the final match allowed the finalist to start with 5 extra chips along with their original stake of 20 (two such advantages were available), and the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> the community cards with two new cards before betting begins.|$|E
50|$|TPF {{is highly}} {{optimized}} to permit {{messages from the}} supported network <b>to</b> either be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> another location, routed to an application (specific set of programs) or to permit extremely efficient accesses to database records.|$|R
30|$|This {{optimization}} problem determines the lines <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> and the dispatch of generators’ reactive and active {{power for the}} purpose of relieving voltage violations. Actually, different load levels are not considered in this model. The TS optimal results are determined on the day ahead based on the average load level of the next day with the solutions of the model proposed.|$|R
50|$|For synchrotrons, the {{situation}} is more complex. Particles are accelerated to the desired energy. Then, a fast acting dipole magnet is used <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> the particles <b>out</b> of the circular synchrotron tube and towards the target.|$|R
50|$|This feature {{allows users}} to run code for certain {{languages}} from within the editor, which eliminates the need <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> to the command line and back again. This function can also be set to build the code automatically every time the file is saved.|$|E
50|$|Once {{scenario}} disks were made, {{the player}} then created their party of 6 characters from the 8 races and 16 classes available. They weren't limited to just 6 characters, however, and could keep {{a roster of}} other characters <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> in the future, but any time they did, the party would {{be returned to the}} starting point of the game.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} only one window on the system, Windows does not show a {{selector}} dialog at all when [...] is pressed; the key sequence will simply restore or give focus to that window in case it is minimized or not focused. This means that under Windows 10, [...] no longer functions as a way <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> of a full-screen application, since the desktop is no longer a window.|$|E
5000|$|The signal box's main {{function}} was {{to operate the}} ETS token system, {{although there was a}} facility <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> Byfield box <b>out</b> and operate a long block. Today, virtually all trace of the line and the station has disappeared ...|$|R
30|$|The {{parameter}} of {{the voltage}} magnitude adjustment from {{the result of}} the master problem to the slave problem is set as γ = 2 %. The parameter of the generator active power adjustment to the slave problem is set as ε = 10 %. The maximum number of lines <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> is set as N_S = 3. The convergence criterion is obtained by checking the objective value of the slave problem, which is set as η< 0.001.|$|R
25|$|There was {{speculation}} that engineer Earl, a senior engineer with an excellent record, exceeded {{the speed limit}} on the curve because of the competitive pressure the passenger railroads were receiving from the airlines. He {{may also have been}} worried about being put further behind schedule once reaching Utica because one of the Pullman cars, with passengers destined for the northern New York towns of Saranac Lake and Lake Placid, would have <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> of the train there to join a different northbound Adirondack Division train.|$|R
50|$|In Los Angeles, {{the group}} tries but fails {{to get close}} to their doubles, so they decide <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> their Hannah, Rachel and Jon for their copies Hannah, Rachel and Jon. After getting the clones to tell them that they are copies, Bradley, Tina and Jo decide to do {{something}} about it after tracking down Gaghan based on his recent online purchases of S Club memorabilia including their underwear, only for them to get caught by his goons.|$|E
5000|$|High Road to Revenge {{gives the}} player the ability <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> {{of their current}} plane during {{gameplay}} and commandeer additional aircraft on the ground. [...] The player also {{has the ability to}} take control of fixed weapon emplacements, at which time the camera shifts to a first-person view.

50|$|The {{gameplay}} for the remastering is {{very similar}} to the original version, albeit with some modifications made to the game. One new feature is the use of the touch screen <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> items, boots, and tunics. Also, the touch screen is used at times to play the Ocarina notes. The game uses the system's gyroscopic technology to look around and aim the player's bow, boomerang, hookshot, longshot and slingshot in first-person mode, unless the player chooses to use the classic analog stick control to aim.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to [...] "U", Super Junior {{was known}} for their member line-up, a concept very similar to Japanese girl group Morning Musume. Certain members of Super Junior's first {{generation}} were <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> and new members were to be added, which would form a second Super Junior generation. However, after {{the addition of a}} thirteenth member, Kyuhyun, the group ended their status as a project group and began to release productions as a group with permanent status. [...] "U" [...] is Kyuhyun's debut single.|$|R
5000|$|If ice loading is suspected, {{it may be}} {{possible}} to increase power transfer on the line, and so raise its temperature by Joule heating, melting the ice. The sudden loss of ice from a line can result in a phenomenon called [...] "jump", in which the catenary dramatically rebounds upwards in response to the change in weight. If the risk of trip is high, the operator may elect <b>to</b> pre-emptively <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> the line in a controlled manner rather than face an unexpected fault. The risk of mechanical failure of the line remains.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conventional}} {{solid metal}} clothes iron {{of the nineteenth}} century weighed around [...] to [...] and had to be heated on a stove. It was so hot, that often a rag or thick cloth mitt was utilized to touch the metal handle without burning of the fingers. Once this all metal iron cooled down, the ironing job at hand had to stop until it was reheated. The advantage of Potts's system was that there was always a waiting heated base ready <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> with the used cooled base, so the ironing could continue immediately.|$|R
5000|$|According to Jon Shafer, [...] "With the {{policies}} system, {{we wanted to}} keep the feel of mixing and matching to construct one's government that was part of Civ IV, but we also wanted to instill a sense of forward momentum. Rather than having <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> of one policy to adopt another, the player builds upon {{the policies}} already unlocked. The thought process we want to promote is 'What cool new effect do I want?' rather than the feeling of needing to perform detailed analysis to determine if switching is a good idea." ...|$|E
50|$|While it was {{possible}} for software <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> the 80-column firmware, making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot, it was not a common thing to do. However, even with the 80-column firmware enabled, slot 3's I/O memory range was still usable, giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus. This meant that it actually {{was possible}} to use slot 3 for things, such as coprocessor cards and language cards, that did not use slot firmware space.|$|E
50|$|Wine Delivery: The {{three players}} who {{did want to}} cook, as well as three who didn't care, had 1 hour, 45 minutes to ride two bikes in varying states of repair along an entirely uphill road. Players were able <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> bike-riding roles as desired, {{with the other two}} members of their group {{following}} along in a van. At the midpoint, each team was given a bottle of wine to take to the church. $10,000 was awarded for each team arriving, and $5,000 for each unharmed bottle of wine.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} normal single line working, tokens would be {{exchanged}} at the signal boxes {{associated with each}} station loop. Initially there was one block from Stratford to Ettington, and another from Ettington to Kineton. In 1911 the facility was added <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> Ettington box <b>out</b> during the night, and work with one long block - a novel system at that time.|$|R
50|$|A user menu {{placed on}} the {{opposite}} side of the screen, which has been available since GNOME 2.14 but has become more prominent in GNOME 3.x, holds access to account and system settings as well as options <b>to</b> log <b>out,</b> <b>switch</b> user, and shut down the computer.|$|R
30|$|Many {{established}} {{companies are}} experimenting with the new possibilities {{in much the same}} way as start-ups. General Motors, for instance, is experimenting with a new model of car ownership that, for a monthly fee, allows customers <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> in and <b>out</b> of different types of Cadillac up to 18 times a year rather than own a single car (Colias 2017). Other firms, like Blockbuster Video, proved unable to respond innovatively and have vanished.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a change}} to the culture beans system, in Civilization V players {{have the ability to}} {{purchase}} social policies with earned culture. These social policies are made up of ten separate trees; prior to the Brave New World expansion pack, filling out five of the ten trees was a requirement to win a cultural victory. These policies replace the [...] "Civics" [...] government system of Civilization IV; the main difference is that the player had <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> of old civics to adopt a new one, while social policies are cumulative bonuses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{questions}} vary, {{increasing in}} difficulty {{and degree of}} personal nature of the questions. Sometimes, a [...] "surprise guest"—such as an ex-partner or a good friend—will come {{on the stage and}} ask a particularly difficult question. Friends, colleagues, and family of the contestant who are gathered near the player have access to a button which can be used <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> a question once per game if they feel that the nature of the question is too personal, an option which is introduced to them after the third question.|$|E
5000|$|While in SD-6 custody Sark {{agrees to}} lead SD-6 to Khasinau in his Paris nightclub {{to recover the}} Rambaldi document. Sydney and Dixon are tasked to {{retrieve}} the document {{and replace it with}} a forgery. Sydney is further tasked by Vaughn <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>out</b> the document with a counterfeit, but is unable to because she spots Will Tippin, who's been brought to Paris to meet a mysterious contact to discuss [...] "The Circumference," [...] in the club. Dixon recovers the document and Sydney extracts Will and, with Jack's aid, returns him to Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|Julia, MATLAB, Python are {{mathematical}} programming languages that have APMonitor integration through web-service APIs. The interfaces are built-in optimization toolboxes or modules to both load and process solutions of optimization problems. APMonitor is an object-oriented modeling language and optimization suite {{that relies on}} programming languages to load, run, and retrieve solutions. APMonitor models and data are compiled at run-time and translated into objects that are solved by an optimization engine such as APOPT or IPOPT. The optimization engine is not specified by APMonitor, allowing several different optimization engines <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out.</b> The simulation or optimization mode is also configurable to reconfigure the model for dynamic simulation, nonlinear model predictive control, moving horizon estimation or general problems in mathematical optimization.|$|R
50|$|Prior to this crash, the New York Central {{had gone}} 13 {{years without a}} {{passenger}} fatality. The year before, it had received the Harriman Award, an annual award presented to American railroad companies in recognition of outstanding safety achievements.There was speculation that engineer Earl, a senior engineer with an excellent record, exceeded the speed limit on the curve because of the competitive pressure the passenger railroads were receiving from the airlines. He {{may also have been}} worried about being put further behind schedule once reaching Utica because one of the Pullman cars, with passengers destined for the northern New York towns of Saranac Lake and Lake Placid, would have <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>out</b> of the train there to join a different northbound Adirondack Division train.|$|R
50|$|The coaster, {{along with}} other {{historic}} rides at Playland like the Derby Racer (1927), is a contributing component to the site's National Historic Landmark status. A marker {{on the wall of}} the loading station lists the ride as one of the original attractions at Playland. The ride is still being manually braked, a feat few coasters can claim today. The ride ran using the original flanged wheel trains until the early 1980s, when the lack of rare parts forced management <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> them <b>out</b> with Morgan Manufacturing trains. These trains are also in use on the two Giant Dipper roller coasters in California, (San Diego and Santa Cruz respectively) the only other roller coasters designed by Church still in operation.|$|R
