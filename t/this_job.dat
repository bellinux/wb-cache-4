5|$|Beauregard's first {{employment}} {{following the}} war was in October 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent of the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad. In 1866 {{he was promoted to}} president, a position he retained until 1870, when he was ousted in a hostile takeover. <b>This</b> <b>job</b> overlapped with that of president of the New Orleans and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he invented a system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{took several}} side jobs {{to save money}} for college, {{including}} waiting tables at the Holmes Club, a saloon for white U.S. Army soldiers. In <b>this</b> <b>job,</b> Brown was frequently the target of racist vitriol and abuse, but nonetheless persevered, earning $600 to pay for college.

5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but <b>this</b> <b>job</b> lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for <b>this</b> <b>job</b> put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E

5|$|Flanders {{began writing}} {{early in his}} career. His {{published}} articles on machine tool technology led to {{a job as an}} editor of Machine magazine in New York City. <b>This</b> <b>job,</b> which he held between 1905 and 1910, required him to cover developments in the machine tool industry. He traveled widely to visit the companies that he wrote about, which provided him many valuable contacts with leaders in the industry.

5|$|In May 1923 {{he visited}} {{continental}} Europe, journeying to the museums in Lausanne, Bern and Zürich to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year {{he became a}} member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, the Institute offered him one of the only archaeological jobs then available in Britain, and he became their librarian, in doing so cementing connections with scholars across Europe. <b>This</b> <b>job</b> meant that he came into contact with many of Britain's archaeologists, of whom there were relatively few during the 1920s; he developed a great friendship with O. G. S. Crawford, the Archaeological Officer to the Ordnance Survey, influencing the latter's move toward socialism and Marxism.|$|E

5|$|Allingham {{was born}} in 1896 in Clapton, County of London. When he was 14 months old, his father, Henry Thomas Allingham (1870-1899), died at age 29 of tuberculosis. Henry is {{recorded}} in the 1901 census with his widowed mother Amy Jane Allingham (née Foster) (1873-1915), a laundress forewoman, living {{with her parents and}} brother at 23 Verulam Avenue, Walthamstow.

His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.|$|E
