Bede recounts that Queen Eormenburh and Cuthbert were visiting Carlisle that day, and that Cuthbert had a premonition of the defeat. Ecgfrith's death threatened to break <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the descendants of Æthelfrith on Northumbria, but the scholar Aldfrith became king and the thrones of Bernicia and Deira remained united.|$|E
5|$|The {{unprecedented}} rainfall {{turned the}} Chena River into a torrent. On August 14, it passed flood stage {{and continued to}} rise. Because no hydrological equipment had been installed upstream of Fairbanks, residents were unaware of the flood's scale. All day and night on August 14, the water rose. It inundated the A-67 site and volunteers allowed water to fill <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the SS Nenana {{to keep it from}} floating on the rising waters and damaging buildings. In downtown Fairbanks, hundreds of volunteers built a sandbag dike around St. Joseph's Hospital to no avail. As the water crested the emergency dike, doctors, nurses, and patients evacuated to the University of Alaska on College Hill.|$|E

25|$|Containerization {{greatly reduced}} {{the expense of}} {{international}} trade and increased its speed, especially of consumer goods and commodities. It also dramatically changed the character of port cities worldwide. Prior to highly mechanized container transfers, crews of 20–22 longshoremen would pack individual cargoes into <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a ship. After containerization, large crews of longshoremen were no longer necessary at port facilities, and the profession changed drastically.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, by the 1930s, {{the growth}} of the urban economy and the exodus of farmers to the cities had {{gradually}} weakened <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the landlords. With {{the growth of}} the wartime economy, the government recognized landlordism as an impediment to increased agricultural productivity, and took steps to increase control over the rural sector through the formation of the Central Agricultural Association, a compulsory organization under the wartime command economy.|$|E
25|$|While the {{composition}} of the nobility changed little in the transition from monastic state to duchy, <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the nobility over the dependent peasantry increased. Prussia's free peasants, called Kölmer (holders of free estates according to Culm law), held with about a sixth of the arable land, a considerable share as compared with other nations in the feudal era. The peasant rebellion had frightened the nobles, however, causing them to look to Duke Albert for leadership.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, {{we look at}} the {{correlation}} among assets.

25|$|In 747, <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Tibet was {{loosened}} by {{the campaign}} of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.|$|E
25|$|The P-36s {{had been}} {{delivered}} to Hawaii in February 1941 by being loaded on the carrier the USS Enterprise in California, {{then in a}} first for the USAAC, flown off the carrier's deck by the P-36's U.S. Army Air Corps pilots when the Enterprise neared the coast of Hawaii.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish Empire on {{possessions}} in the Americas {{was reduced}} in the 1820s {{as a result}} of the Spanish American wars of independence; only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish–American War (1898) that resulted from the Cuban War of Independence. Under the Treaty of Paris, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate; the U.S. gained a position of economic and political dominance over the island, which persisted after it became formally independent in 1902.|$|E

25|$|In 734 the Tibetans married their princess Dronmalön (‘Dron ma lon) to the Türgesh Qaghan. The Chinese {{allied with}} the Caliphate to attack the Türgesh. After victory and peace with the Türgesh, the Chinese {{attacked}} the Tibetan army. The Tibetans suffered several defeats in the east, despite strength in the west. The Türgesh empire collapsed from internal strife. In 737, the Tibetans launched an attack against the king of Bru-za (Gilgit), who asked for Chinese help, but was ultimately forced {{to pay homage to}} Tibet.

25|$|The first 13 {{aircraft}} for the Indian Air Force (IAF) were assembled at Hamble-le-Rice, {{they were}} followed by partly completed aircraft and then sub-assemblies as Hindustan Aircraft slowly took over first assembly, and then production of the aircraft.

The first Gnat squadron was the No. 23 (Cheetah), which converted from Vampire FB.52 on 18 March 1960 using six Folland-built Gnats. The first aircraft built from Indian-built parts first flew in May 1962. The last Indian-built Gnat F.1 was delivered on 31 January 1974.|$|E
25|$|Stage 7 {{was where}} the Enterprise-B's bridge, {{deflector}} room and corridors were built and filmed.

Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elecit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the Enterprise-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to appear a different setting.

25|$|Unanticipated fallout and the {{radiation}} emitted by it also affected {{many of the}} vessels and personnel involved in the test, in some cases forcing them into bunkers for several hours. In contrast to {{the crew of the}} Lucky Dragon No. 5, who did not appreciate the hazard and therefore did not take shelter in <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> their ship, or refrain from inhaling the fallout dust, the firing crew that triggered the explosion was able to safely shelter in their firing station when they noticed the wind was carrying the fallout in the unanticipated direction towards the island of Enyu on the Bikini Atoll where they were located, with the fire crew sheltering in place ("buttoning up") for several hours until outside radiation decayed to safer levels. 250 rads were recorded above the bunker.|$|E
25|$|Ferrières {{returned}} to France, and in 1581, by then heavily in debt, joined the King of Navarre, the future Henri IV of France, in Gascony, {{and was named}} by him commander of Casteljaloux, an office which he fulfilled until January 1584. He then went to Saintonge, and despite his age engaged in conflict there between Protestant and Catholic forces. The galleys of a certain Captain Carles were making frequent sorties against the Ile d'Oléron, {{in the course of}} which battles Ferrières was captured in 1586 by Catholic forces and handed over to Carles, who demanded a heavy ransom which Ferrières was unable to pay. In consequence Carles allowed Ferrières, at the age of about sixty-six, 'to die like a dog while bound to the magazine at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the captain's galley'.|$|E
25|$|Years later, Pony {{discovered}} {{that her son}} Aydrian was still alive and had been trained by the elves like his father.

In the final battle against Aydrian's army, Pony fought against her son, her husband's zombie-spirit and Bestesbulzibar's spirit. She summoned Elbryan's consciousness from within the zombie and they released Aydrian from <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the demon. Ten years later, Pony died after spending the last decade with her son.
