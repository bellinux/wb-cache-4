5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearing.|$|E

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds that}} the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but California has since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E

25|$|Regulated {{games are}} overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol {{the course to}} ensure {{enforcement}} of the rules {{and the safety of}} the players. If a player is marked with paint, they will call him out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game or eliminate cheating.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} campaign was overshadowed by allegations of planned electoral fraud, irregularities and the controversial involvement of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan {{in the electoral}} process. Numerous politically motivated acts of violence and vandalism targeted party activists, candidates, vehicles and campaign offices. Prospects of electoral fraud was particularly significant during the election, due to the extensive fraud allegations made during the 2014 local elections {{and the fact that}} opinion polls suggested that the governing AKP may lose its parliamentary majority. Various irregularities throughout the campaign, {{such as the use of}} state funds by AKP politicians for campaigning, media bias, forced participation for the government's electoral rallies, incorrect voter data and the use of bogus opinion polls also raised concerns about <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> election.|$|E
25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small it is, he or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that was a party to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because there was a real possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proceedings.|$|E

40|$|Perceiving other people’s actions {{triggers}} {{activity in}} premotor and parietal areas, brain areas {{also involved in}} executing and sensing our own actions. Paralleling this phenomenon, observing emotional states (including pain) in others is associated with activity in the same brain areas as activated when experiencing similar emotions directly. This emotion perception associated activity {{has been shown to}} be affected by <b>the</b> perceived <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor, and in-group membership more generally. Here, we examine whether action observation associated brain activity is also affected by <b>the</b> perceived social <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actors. Perceived <b>fairness</b> was manipulated using an alternating iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game between the participant and two confederates, one of whom played fairly and the other unfairly. During fMRI scanning the participants watched movies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confederates performing object-directed hand actions, and then performed hand actions themselves. Mass-univariate analysis showed that observing the actions triggered robust activation in regions associated with action execution, but failed to identify a strong modulation of this activation based on perceived fairness. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, identified clusters potentially carrying information about <b>the</b> perceived <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor in the middle temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, right middle cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, and right superioroccipital gyrus. Despite being identified by a whole-brain searchlight analysis (and so without anatomical restriction), these clusters fall into areas frequently associated with action observation. We conclude that brain activity during action observation may be modulated by perceived fairness, but such modulation is subtle; robust activity is associated with observing <b>the</b> actions <b>of</b> both fair and unfair individuals...|$|R
25|$|Criminal {{trials for}} the accused {{commenced}} in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005.

In December 2005, as the trials began, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment, with Australian lawyers counter-claiming that <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial was in jeopardy.|$|E
25|$|When Aelony {{arrived at}} the University of Minnesota, he met some of the few {{students}} of color and discovered {{that only a small}} number were from the local communities, since most local blacks chose to attend black colleges and universities in the South. He also found that other minority students were having trouble obtaining local housing and employment in Minneapolis. Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was full, white students would go ask for a room there to test <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.|$|E

30|$|Figure  11 a, b shows <b>the</b> {{short-term}} <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protocols. As the node density increases, <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> {{index for}} all schemes decrease gradually. Notably, <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> 802.11 DCF {{is much lower}} than the random channel scheme and N-DCF. This is due to <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> exponential random backoff. When a node is caught in a packet collision, its chance <b>of</b> accessing <b>the</b> channel becomes lower because the contention window is doubled. So by reducing packet collisions, short-term fairness can be improved as well as throughput. <b>Fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> random channel scheme and N-DCF are similar, because they both reduce contention by distributing contention overhead across channels.|$|R

500|$|How {{the work}} was {{obtained}} and for what purpose is also a factor. If {{the work was}} obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing {{is less likely to}} be [...] "fair" [...] than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must [...] "judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest person would have dealt with the copyright work in the manner" [...] in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper, the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dealing.

30|$|This section {{presents}} and analyses {{the results from}} this study using a sophisticated version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tswTCM algorithm.
