500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{to be the most important}} thing that has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E

He said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult". In an interview with Ronald Bailey, published in December 2000, he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother. He did say that, if he were solely responsible, his mother might not continue to live.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933, Bankhead {{nearly died}} {{following}} a five-hour emergency hysterectomy due to venereal disease, which she claimed she had contracted from George Raft. Only 70 lb (32kg) {{when she left}} the hospital, she stoically said to her doctor, [...] "Don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> taught me a lesson!" [...] In 1934, after recuperating in Alabama, she returned to England. After only a short stay, she was called back to New York to play in The Little Foxes. Although Bette Davis played the leading character in the 1941 film version, she openly admitted in later years that she had emulated Bankhead in the role. Bankhead continued to play in various performances over the next few years, gaining excellent notices for her portrayal of Elizabeth in a revival of Somerset Maugham's The Circle.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E

Curious, Oskar sets out on a mission to contact every person in New York City with the last name of Black in the hope of finding the lock that belongs to the key his father left behind.|$|R

[...] "It {{just seems to}} say all the things one can't say oneself." [...] She gave a nervous little laugh and looked {{from one to another}} with great benignity, as though she would like to say {{something}} but could not find the words in which to express it.

60|$|Another {{striking}} {{quality in}} Hamlet's nature is his perpetual inclination to irony. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been generally passed over too lightly, {{as if it}} were something external and accidental, rather assumed as a mask than part of the real nature of the man. It seems to me to go deeper, to be something innate, and not merely factitious. It is nothing like the grave irony of Socrates, which was the weapon of a man thoroughly in earnest,--the boomerang of argument, which one throws in the opposite direction of what he means to hit, and which seems to be flying away from the adversary, who will presently find himself knocked down by it. It is not like the irony of Timon, which is but the wilful refraction of a clear mind twisting awry whatever enters it,--or of Iago, which is the slime that a nature essentially evil loves to trail over all beauty and goodness to taint them with distrust: it is the half-jest, half-earnest of an inactive temperament that has not quite made up its mind whether life is a reality or no, whether men were not made in jest, and which amuses itself equally with finding a deep meaning in trivial things and a trifling one in the profoundest mysteries of being, because the want of earnestness in its own essence infects everything else with its own indifference. If there be now and then an unmannerly rudeness and bitterness in it, as in the scenes with Polonius and Osrick, we must remember that Hamlet was just in the condition which spurs men to sallies of this kind: dissatisfied, at one neither with the world nor with himself, and accordingly casting about for something out of himself to vent his spleen upon. But even in these passages there is no hint of earnestness, of any purpose beyond the moment; they are mere cat's-paws of vexation, and not the deep-raking ground-swell of passion, as we see it in the sarcasm of Lear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{heard him}} say {{something}} about a man named Porter. They had met somewhere--I think in London. The man had a daughter named Laura, and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> Jasniff <b>had</b> been calling upon her." ...|$|R

6000|$|I did not <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> {{been so long}} a Poem. I {{have another}} not so long--but as it will more {{conveniently}} be copied {{on the other side}} I will just put down here some observations on Caleb Williams by Hazlitt--I meant to say St. Leon, for although he has mentioned all the Novels of Godwin very freely I do not quote them, but this only on account of its being a specimen of his usual abrupt manner, and fiery laconicism. He says of St. Leon-- ...|$|R

50|$|While not {{inclined}} to openly criticise other artists, Logsdail did, in his memoirs, relate a story concerning Walter Sickert. As he worked on his Ponte della Paglia (1898), Sickert arrived and set up his easel nearby. He then 'began to caper like a master of fence, backing and lunging with sudden stabs at his canvas'. An American passing by noticed {{a button on the}} pavement, retrieved it and, offering it to Sickert, said, 'Excuse me, sir, but I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> worked loose!'.|$|E

50|$|Early in Part 2 of {{the novel}} we learn that the {{relationship}} between Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin has broken down, and that Rogozhin <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> happened because Nastasya Filippovna is really in love with the Prince. Although Rogozhin continues his tortured pursuit of Nastasya Filippovna and maintains an ambivalent friendship with Myshkin, he shows himself to be capable of doing violence to both of them. After this the first triangle recedes somewhat into the background, although it remains as an ominous presence in all the characters' minds.|$|R

5000|$|Outgoing President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, 85, {{was asked}} to run for another mandate by the centre-right House of Freedoms, with the strong support of the centre-left Union. However, Ciampi {{declined}} to run again, noting that [...] "none of the past nine presidents of the Republic has been re-elected. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> become a meaningful rule. It is better not to infringe it." [...] Ciampi was elected in 1999 at the first ballot, becoming only the second president ever to win on the first ballot, after Francesco Cossiga.|$|E
5000|$|Well, I {{mean it was}} a {{starting}} point, but then the record company said 'Oh, that song's really good, {{that could be a}} single.' And then the moment they say it could be a single, it likes... making it really difficult. Cause you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> to be something that plays on the radio and has to work, but it's recorded as well, and you started to put pressure on the track.

5000|$|The series, {{including}} its title, {{is inspired by}} Iceland's tourism boom, following the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull. Actor Atli Bollason discussed the premise in an interview: But these are interesting times in Reykjavík because the outsider’s gaze has never been as prominent as it is right now. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{a profound effect on}} not only how we perceive ourselves but how we behave as well. We are living, breathing stereotypes; super-conscious of the role we’re expected to play on the ‘famous’ Reykjavík scene and I think the series is partly playing with this new reality.
