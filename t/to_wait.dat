5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for their {{wants and needs}} to be met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E

40|$|Management of {{consumer}} waiting experiences {{is critical for}} practitioners in that unpleasant waiting experiences may result in negative service evaluations. This study focused on consumers' queue waits during the pre-process phase of waiting experiences, i. e., before services are received, and investigated {{the extent to which}} relevant variables during this process may impact consumers' subsequent service experience evaluations. The investigation purported to expand and refine the expectation-affect-service evaluation relationship. Specifically, the framework examined the influence of predicted value of service on wait expectations (conceptualized as "consumer zone of wait tolerance" derived from the service literatures), the effects {{of consumer}}s' comparisons between wait expectations and perceptions (i. e., wait disconfirmation) and perceived wait duration on affective responses <b>to</b> <b>waiting,</b> and the impact of affective responses <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> on service experience evaluations. In addition, this study predicted the moderating role of actions of the service provider from a social justice perspective in the relationship between affective response <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> and service experience evaluation. Data were collected at two points in time (i. e., during waiting and at completion of service) via surveys completed by 393 adult consumers intercepted at three restaurants located in a southwestern city in the U. S. Hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling, MANCOVA statistical techniques, and additional post hoc analyses. Findings suggest that both wait disconfirmation and perceived wait duration influence service experience evaluation through affective response <b>to</b> <b>waiting.</b> Results also revealed a positive relationship between predicted conditional value and zone of wait tolerance. The study provides support for social exchange theory and better understanding of the role of actions of the service provider in the relationship between affective response <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> and service experience evaluation. Lastly, post hoc analyses lend credence to the concept that consumers' affective responses <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> and service experience evaluations vary across the wait disconfirmation groups. Both theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and directions for future research are also provided...|$|R

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{for a longer}} delay, {{as long as the}} reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
