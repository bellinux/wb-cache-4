5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a <b>tenderer</b> for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other <b>tenderer.</b> Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E
25|$|John Holland Group was {{announced}} as the successful <b>tenderer</b> for the infrastructure works on 31 May 2012, covering {{the design and}} construction of the nine stations, bridge works, signalling and power supply. The extension opened on 27 March 2014.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tender</b> box is a mailbox {{that is used}} {{to receive}} the {{physical}} <b>tender</b> or bid documents. When a <b>tender</b> or bid is being called, a <b>tender</b> or bid number is usually issued as a reference number for the <b>tender</b> box. The <b>tender</b> box would be open for interested parties to submit their proposals {{for the duration of the}} bid or <b>tender.</b>|$|R

50|$|Invitation to <b>tender</b> is also {{a similar}} process to a <b>tender</b> notification. The major {{difference}} is the institution or organisation who created the <b>tender</b> chooses who to invite, often {{in the form of}} a closed <b>tender.</b> <b>Tender</b> notification services provide a vast array of people and companies about an open <b>tender</b> that anyone can apply for.|$|R
25|$|The {{successful}} <b>tenderer,</b> Rivercity Motorway Limited, {{was announced}} by Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman on 27 April 2006, beating a bid by the Brisconnections consortium. Contracts for {{design and construction}} were given to Leighton Contractors and Baulderstone/Bilfinger Berger Joint Venture. Transurban declined to place a tender because of risk-return factors.|$|E
25|$|Moves towards {{automated}} ticketing {{were first}} made in 1992. Tenders were {{called for the}} design, supply, installation and on-going maintenance of the system, with the 'OneLink Transit Consortium' becoming the preferred <b>tenderer</b> in September 1993. The contract was signed in May 1994, with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group (now Vix Technology).|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{integrated}} ticketing until March 2014, a second boarding from one bus route to another or to a different mode generally required the payment of a new fare. However, as part of a push by ARTA and NZ Transport Agency, an integrated ticketing / smartcard system was introduced in Auckland by successful <b>tenderer</b> Thales, similar to systems like Octopus card in Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tender</b> {{notifications}} (sometimes called <b>tender</b> alerts), {{provide the}} client with given <b>tender</b> {{information that they}} desire. This is often delivered {{in the form of}} an email notification, saving the client visiting multiple websites to check for updates on potential clients. Most repacks provide both private and public sector <b>tender</b> opportunities. The idea is that <b>tender</b> notification systems deliver <b>tender</b> opportunities to the company, dramatically reducing the amount of time spent looking for these <b>tenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Type MP1 <b>tenders</b> {{originally}} entered South African Railways (SAR) {{service in}} 1912, as <b>tenders</b> to Class 12 Mountain type locomotives. The locomotive and <b>tender</b> {{were designed by}} D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR. <b>Tenders</b> were numbered for their original engines and an oval number plate, bearing the engine number and often also the <b>tender</b> type, {{was attached to the}} rear end of the <b>tender.</b> The particular <b>tender</b> which was to be modified to Type XP1, entered service in 1913 as <b>tender</b> to Class MC1 Mallet no. 1634.|$|R

25|$|Solid Waste: The {{community}} {{established a}} charitable trust which bid on Auckland City's contract for solid waste disposal. After winning the bid, it was implemented with such success that the recycling centre soon {{had to be}} expanded to handle the volumes. However, when the contract term expired in 2009, the Council voted to disqualify incumbent <b>tenderer</b> Clean Stream Waiheke Ltd and grant Transpacific Industries Group Ltd a $22 million contract. The decision was political.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a report}} by the RAND Corporation into options for Australia’s naval {{shipbuilding}} industry, the Government announced an $89 billion naval shipbuilding plan. This plan brought the schedule of the Future Frigate Program forward by three years and announced a “continuous onshore build program to commence in 2020” in South Australia. A competitive evaluation process was announced in April 2016, with Navantia, Fincantieri, and BAE Systems revealed as the contenders to design the ships. A decision on a preferred <b>tenderer</b> is expected in 2018.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the Australian Government {{approved}} {{a project to}} build six amphibious watercraft to operate from the Royal Australian Navy's two Kanimbla class landing platform amphibious (LPA). These craft were to be operated by the Australian Army and would replace its LCM-8s. In October 2001 ADI {{was selected as the}} preferred <b>tenderer</b> to build the six watercraft; at this time it was intended that the first of the class would enter service in 2003. A contract for the craft was signed in July 2002 and construction work began at ADI's facilities at Carrington, New South Wales in February 2003. The sixth LCM2000 was completed in August 2005, though at the time there were plans to order further craft. The six LCMs were named AB 2000, AB 2001, AB 2002, AB 2003, AB 2004 and AB 2005.|$|E
50|$|A {{request for}} <b>tender</b> and request for {{quotation}} is a closed <b>tender</b> where people are invited by a buyer to quote for specific work. A <b>tender</b> notification alerts potential suppliers of open <b>tenders</b> that they then have to register interest in before entering the <b>tendering</b> process.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{tank wagon}} type <b>tender,</b> similar in {{appearance}} to the North American Vanderbilt type <b>tender,</b> with a cylindrical water tank which had an inside diameter of 6 ft. The <b>tender</b> {{was similar to}} the Type MX <b>tender,</b> but its wheelbase was 10 ft shorter. Like the Type MX <b>tender,</b> it rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies, supplied by General Steel Castings of Eddystone, Pennsylvania, and became commonly known as a Torpedo <b>tender.</b> Like its engine, the <b>tender</b> was equipped with vacuum brakes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tenders</b> {{from various}} {{scrapped}} locomotive types were used. The <b>tender</b> {{depicted in the}} main picture is a three-axle <b>tender</b> while the official SAR locomotive diagram depicts a <b>tender</b> with four axles on two bogies.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the Australian {{government}} {{promised that}} the government-owned ASC, the company responsible for building the Collins class, would build the new submarines. In a May 2009 announcement about plans to release a request for tender, the Labor government indicated that if a company other than ASC was the successful <b>tenderer,</b> that company would be granted access to ASC's shipyard in Osborne, South Australia. Despite ongoing support for the submarines {{to be built in}} South Australia by successive Coalition and Labor governments, in July 2014, the Abbott-led Coalition government abandoned their pre-election commitment to ASC-based construction and opened up the likely possibility of building the submarines at a foreign shipyard. In February 2015 the Abbott Government in announcing a 'competitive evaluation process' noted that the government would not approach the submarine decision with an 'open cheque book', but would rather allow a competitive process in which various construction options would be explored, including construction in Australia, overseas, or a 'hybrid approach' of foreign and local construction, along with estimated costs and schedules.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only You Know and I Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, <b>tenderer</b> reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, the Austria-Hungary Naval Technical Committee {{initiated}} {{the design and}} development of a [...] coastal torpedo boat, specifying {{that it should be}} capable of sustaining [...] for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea, would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the Austro-Hungarian Navy (...) base at the Bay of Kotor (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. Steam turbine power was selected for propulsion, as diesels with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run turbo-electric boats. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Triest was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other <b>tenderer.</b> The T-group designation signified the builder, STT.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} AB <b>tender</b> {{design was}} adapted for the three-cylinder G class locomotive 4-6-2 <b>tender</b> locomotive rebuilds of 1937. These <b>tenders</b> {{had a more}} substantial <b>tender</b> underframe, and was also unique in that the body was of welded construction rather than the traditional riveted style. As such, they {{became known as the}} 'G' style <b>tender.</b> When the six locomotives were withdrawn in 1956, their <b>tenders</b> were fitted to AB class locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group agreed {{on a set of}} {{standards}} for all water <b>tenders</b> that are used for wildland firefighting. The <b>tenders</b> are divided into support <b>tenders</b> and tactical <b>tenders.</b>|$|R

2500|$|It was {{not until}} 9 September 1890 that the New Zealand Midland Railway Company put out a call for tenders for the {{construction}} of the next section of the line from Belgrove to the Motueka Valley.

2500|$|Though the {{financial}} requirements {{of such a}} project were beyond the means of both the provincial and central governments at the time, {{it was suggested that}} a British firm be engaged to finance, construct and own the line as had already been successfully done in other developing nations. [...] As a further incentive, Wrigg suggested that the Brunner coal mine be given to the successful <b>tenderer</b> as an immediate and certain source of income.|$|E
50|$|Five {{locomotive}} {{classes and}} models, built by six manufacturers, were delivered new with Type KT <b>tenders,</b> which were numbered for their engines {{in the number}} ranges as shown. An oval number plate, bearing the engine number and often also the <b>tender</b> type, {{was attached to the}} rear end of the <b>tender.</b> On some <b>tenders,</b> presumably after number plates went astray, the number was weld-written on the <b>tender</b> instead, as on the illustrated <b>tender</b> no. 2041.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tender</b> {{was mounted}} on bogie trucks for smooth riding: a {{refinement}} that the <b>tenders</b> of LMS and LNER streamliners lacked. The PC class <b>tender</b> {{was equipped with}} a <b>tender</b> cab in case the locomotive needed to run tender-first.|$|R

2500|$|Planning of {{the airport}} link started in the 1980s. In 1993 the Government of Sweden issued a tender for a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) to build the Arlanda Line. [...] The construction of the line was subsidized {{with a combination of}} some state grants and large state loans. The successful <b>tenderer</b> would receive a monopoly on traffic between the airport and Stockholm until 2040. The line and the services were inaugurated on 25 November 1999. The PPP contract has since been criticized for being unclear, uneconomical for the state and leading to a low utilization of the service.|$|E
2500|$|However, it was {{announced}} in April 1999 that the winning <b>tenderer</b> was Hai Sun Hup Group subsidiary Knoxville Group. This proposal was to develop Hai Sun Hup's site {{at the corner of}} St Georges Terrace and Milligan Street into an office tower and hotel project. This [...] site stretches all the way from St Georges Terrace to Hay Street, and had been bought by Alistair McAlpine for $100 million, before later being sold to Hai Sun Hup in 1996 for just $20 million. The mostly vacant site was occupied by small buildings fronting Hay Street and vacant land fronting all three streets. The corner of Milligan Street and St Georges Terrace also featured the eight-storey AWA Computer House. The development also necessitated the demolition of the building on Hay Street which housed the Matsuri Japanese Restaurant, which moved to new premises in QV.1.|$|E
2500|$|Austin {{embarked}} {{on the process}} of preparing the working surveys and estimates, which would take him until August 1872 to complete. [...] Despite this progress, there was unease within Nelson province with regard to the fact that contracts had yet to be awarded for work on the line. [...] When it was announced on 10 August that nine contracts had been let for railway construction but that the Nelson line was not among them, Nelsonians were left to wonder if the government had broken its promises. [...] As it turned out, the problem for the authorities was in deciding on a route out of Nelson. [...] While Austin was tasked with investigating the matter further, tenders were called for the [...] section from Stoke to Foxhill and steps were taken to acquire the necessary land. [...] The successful <b>tenderer</b> for the Waimea contract was a local firm by the name of Scott and Robinson.|$|E
