If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, it was {{reported}} that Schroeder intended to leave the University of Minnesota and join the Everett Silvertips, a team in the major junior Western Hockey League. This was denied by Schroeder, who wanted to spend at least another year with the Golden Gophers. The Golden Gophers finished the season with a losing record, the first time they had done so in more than 10years, and lost in the first round of the playoffs, the second time in the past 33 years <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Schroeder finished with 9 goals and 28 points in 37 games, tied for the team lead in points, the lowest for the team's leading scorer since 1962.|$|E

The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk about anything <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} third {{consecutive}} year Hershey was eliminated {{in the first round}} of the Calder Cup playoffs. They became the tenth team in AHL history to be eliminated after winning the first two games of a best-of-five series; the last was the Lowell Lock Monsters, who lost to St. John's Maple Leafs in 2002. The road team won every game of the Bears and Bruins series. The only other time <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> in AHL history was in 1995, when the Fredericton Canadiens eliminated the St. John's Maple Leafs. Hershey finished the season with a league-worst average of 26.42 shots on goal per game, and a total of 204 goals, the team's lowest since 2003–04.|$|E

5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> previously in his life.|$|E
