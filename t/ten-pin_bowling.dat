He cut five tenpins down to about 75% of their size, and used hand-sized hard rubber balls, thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling. [...] Five-pin is played {{in all parts of}} Canada, but not played in any other country. Candlepin bowling is played at several centres in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.|$|R

25|$|<b>Ten-pin</b> <b>bowling</b> was {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 1960. This was driven by the opening of the Stamford Hill and Golders Green bowling alleys in London. <b>Ten-pin</b> <b>bowling</b> took the UK by storm, with alleys opening up one after the other. At its peak, there were over 160 bowling alleys in the UK, but a lack of re-investment and waning interest left the fad in a sorry state. This led to a general deterioration of bowling alleys, with a commensurate decline in their image. In the 1970s a major chain operator, Top Rank, pulled out of bowling and converted many of the more luxurious alleys into Bingo halls. The industry nearly collapsed, with two thirds of the existing alleys closing over the next few years.|$|E

25|$|While still {{closely related}} to the German nine-pin game Kegeln, the modern version of <b>ten-pin</b> <b>bowling</b> that became a popular {{participant}} sport worldwide was an American creation. German immigrants were instrumental in fostering the game's popularity in America as they formed their own bowling clubs {{both before and after the}} American Civil War. The first indoor bowling alley was Knickerbockers of New York City, built in 1840. The Brunswick Corporation's addition of bowling equipment to their product line also served to increase the sport's popularity. In 1914, Brunswick replaced their line of wooden bowling balls, mostly made with lignum vitae, with hard rubber Mineralite bowling balls. The change was met with great approval.|$|E
25|$|The USBC {{completed}} {{data analysis}} and released a lengthy report {{on its website}} (www.bowl.com) {{to the public in}} the spring of 2008. As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified <b>ten-pin</b> <b>bowling.</b> This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the coverstock of a bowling ball was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of a bowling ball. The radius of gyration specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010.

25|$|Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic {{used the}} Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed {{sponsors}} to Wilson in 2005. He couldn't find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson {{agreed to make}} him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head. After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign. Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip. In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and <b>ten-pin</b> <b>bowling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bowling has {{a unique}} scoring system which keeps track {{not only of the}} current pinfall in a frame, but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of {{subsequent}} pinfall. Effectively, there are three kinds of marks given in a score; a strike (all ten down in the first ball), a spare (all ten down by the second ball), and an open (one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball). A strike earns ten pins plus the pins for the next two balls thrown. (For example, if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2, their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2, or 19.) A spare earns ten pins plus the pins for the next ball thrown. (Again, if a player gets a spare then follows it with 7 pins down on the first ball of the next frame, their value for the spare frame would be 10+7, or 17.) A strike after a spare would earn 20 pins. The same score would be obtained if the reverse occurred. Open frames count the value of the pinfall in that frame only. (Example: if a player knocks down 5 on their first ball and 3 on their second, the open frame would be worth 8 pins.) The maximum score in <b>ten-pin</b> <b>bowling</b> is 300. This consists of getting 12 strikes in a row in one game (one strike each in frames 1–9, all three possible strikes in the tenth frame), and is also known as a perfect game.|$|E
