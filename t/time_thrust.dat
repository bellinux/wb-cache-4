More she could not see, for Eveline turned on the threshold, and kissing her at the same <b>time,</b> <b>thrust</b> her gently back into the smaller apartment which she had just left, shut the door of communication, and barred and bolted it, as if in security against her well-meant intrusion.|$|E
6000|$|First the {{stranger}} measured Robin with his eye, {{and then he}} measured the oaken staff. [...] "Thou art right, good fellow," [...] said he presently, [...] "truly, my sword is no match for that cudgel of thine. Bide thee awhile till I get me a staff." [...] So saying, he threw aside the rose {{that he had been}} holding all this <b>time,</b> <b>thrust</b> his sword back into the scabbard, and, with a more hasty step than he had yet used, stepped to the roadside where grew the little clump of ground oaks Robin had spoken of. Choosing among them, he presently found a sapling to his liking. He did not cut it, but, rolling up his sleeves a little way, he laid hold of it, placed his heel against the ground, and, with one mighty pull, plucked the young tree up by the roots from out the very earth. Then he came back, trimming away the roots and tender stems with his sword as quietly as if he had done nought to speak of.|$|E
60|$|Whoever {{has been}} through an {{extensive}} iron-works, has seen a gigantic pair of shears worked by machinery, and used for cutting in two, bars of iron that are from time to <b>time</b> <b>thrust</b> between its blades. Supposing these blades {{to be the only}} visible parts of the apparatus, anyone observing their movements (or rather the movement of one, for the other is commonly fixed), will see from {{the manner in which the}} angle increases and decreases, and from the curve described by the moving extremity, that there must be some centre of motion--either a pivot or an external box equivalent to it. This may be regarded as a necessary correlation. Moreover, he might infer that beyond the centre of motion the moving blade was produced into a lever, to which the power was applied; but as another arrangement is just possible, this could not be called anything more than a highly probable correlation. If now he went a step further, and asked how the reciprocal movement was given to the lever, he would perhaps conclude that it was given by a crank. But if he knew anything of mechanics, he would know that it might possibly be given by an eccentric. Or again, he would know that the effect could be achieved by a cam. That is to say, he would see that there was no necessary correlation between the shears and the remoter parts of the apparatus. Take another case. The plate of a printing-press is required to move up and down to the extent of an inch or so; and it must exert its greatest pressure when it reaches the extreme of its downward movement. If now anyone will look over the stock of a printing-press maker, he will see half a dozen different mechanical arrangements by which these ends are achieved; and a machinist would tell him that as many more might readily be invented. If, then, there is no necessary correlation between the special parts of a machine, still less is there between those of an organism.|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} how in my muddled and wounded phase I had {{snatched}} at the dull project of improving my languages, {{and under the}} cloak of that spying a little upon German military arrangements. Now my mind set such petty romanticism on one side. It had recovered the strength to look on the whole of life and on my place in it. It could resume the ideas that our storm of passion had for a <b>time</b> <b>thrust</b> into the background of my thoughts. I took up again all those broad generalizations that had arisen out of my experiences in South Africa, and which I had been not so much fitting into as forcing into the formulæ of English politics; I recalled my disillusionment with British Imperialism, my vague but elaborating apprehension of a profound conflict between enterprise and labor, a profound conflict between {{the life of the}} farm and the life of trade and finance and wholesale production, as being something far truer to realities than any of the issues of party and patriotism upon which men were spending their lives. So far as this rivalry between England and Germany, which so obsessed the imagination of Europe, went, I found that any faith I may have had in its importance had simply fallen out of my mind. As a danger to civilization, as a conceivable source of destruction and delay, it was a monstrous business enough, but {{that in the long run}} it mattered how or when they fought and which won I did not believe. In the development of mankind the thing was of far less importance than the struggle for Flanders or the wars of France and Burgundy. I was already coming to see Europe as no more than the dog's-eared corner of the page of history,--like most Europeans I had thought it the page--and my recovering mind was eager and open to see the world beyond and form some conception of the greater forces that lay outside our insularities. What is humanity as a whole doing? What is the nature of the world process of which I am a part? Why should I drift from cradle to grave wearing the blinkers of my time and nationality, a mere denizen of Christendom, accepting its beliefs, its stale antagonisms, its unreal purposes? That perhaps had been tolerable while I was still an accepted member of the little world into which my lot had fallen, but now that I was thrust out its absurdity glared. For me the alternative was to be a world-man or no man. I had seemed sinking towards the latter: now I faced about and began to make myself what I still seek to make myself to-day, a son of mankind, a conscious part of that web of effort and perplexity which wraps about our globe....|$|E

50|$|MacKinnon {{often used}} a broadly Kantian metaphysics to {{determine}} the limits of a person's knowledge of God. Subsequently, there is a close relationship between God and ethics in MacKinnon’s work. But MacKinnon veers away from concluding that Kant collapsed God into ethics. Nor does he accept - the further conclusion that sometimes follows this - that Kant's epistemology precludes metaphysical realism, i.e. necessitates anti-realism, in ethics and theology. In The Problem of Metaphysics (1974) MacKinnon develops a Kantian epistemology and comes close to an agnostic position on God, except for the proviso that ethical decision-making {{has the capacity to}} make agents aware of a kind of metaphysical realism. He goes on to argue that it is in keeping with a Kantian metaphysics to deduce God from this sense of awareness: 'Kant is in the end a theist....His God does not enter into the texture of his exposition....he lies altogether beyond the frontiers of intelligible referential and descriptive statement. But we are all the <b>time</b> <b>thrust</b> outside those frontiers, precipitated beyond them by a moral experience on whose formal unity, in the most diverse human situations, Kant insists.' MacKinnon is, in this respect, against interpreters of Kant who consider his epistemology to have anti-realist conclusions. He is also quite specifically against the view that an anti-realist theology needs to be developed as renewed approach to Christian thought, e.g. the approach developed by Don Cupitt.|$|E

40|$|The tailoff thrust and impulse {{imbalance}} between {{pairs of}} solid rocket motors {{is of particular}} interest for the Space Shuttle Vehicle because of the potential control problems that exist with this asymmetric configuration. Although a similar arrangement of solid rocket motors was utilized for the Titan Program, they produced less than one-half the thrust level of the Space Shuttle at web action time, and the overall vehicle was symmetric. Since the Titan Program does provide the most applicable actual test data, 23 flight pairs were analyzed to determine the actual tailoff thrust and impulse imbalance experienced.

40|$|Abstract: One {{promising}} {{technique for}} deflecting a near Earth object headed for an impact with the Earth {{is to use}} low thrust devices (several Newtons) {{for long periods of}} time (several years). During the <b>time</b> <b>thrust</b> is applied to the object, the initial impact point moves slowly across the surface of the Earth until it “lifts off”, i. e., the path of the object becomes tangential to the Earth’s surface. This path across the Earth is the locus of instantaneous impact points from the initial (act of God) point until the point of liftoff. The course of this “deflection path ” is an act of humankind, albeit one determined by the minimization of fuel and time to liftoff. The deflection path may cross many political boundaries between the initial and end points. Further compounding the implied policy issues is the fact that lateral (non-optimal) movement of the path can be generated by the expenditure of additional fuel, e. g., to minimize risk to specific population concentrations. Public concern will arise at both the planning and execution stages of this process. The public policy implications of this situation call for the development of rational planning criteria through international mechanisms prior to the detection of a pending impact by a near Eart...|$|E

There were no problems with the solid rocket motor launches, overall motor performance was excellent. There were no debris concerns from either motor. Nearly all ballistic contract end item specification parameters were verified {{with the exception of}} ignition interval, pressure rise rate, and ignition <b>time</b> <b>thrust</b> imbalance. These could not be verified due to elimination of developmental flight instrumentation on 360 L 004 (STS- 30 R) and subsequent, but low sample rate data that were available showed nominal propulsion performance. All ballistic and mass property parameters that could be assessed closely matched the predicted values and were well within the required contract end item specification levels. All field joint heaters and igniter joint heaters performed without anomalies. Evaluation of the ground environment instrumentation measurements again verified thermal model analysis data and showed agreement with predicted environmental effects. No launch commit criteria violations occurred. Postflight inspection again verified nominal performance of the insulation, phenolics, metal parts, and seals.

40|$|The Late Cretaceous {{foreland}} basin {{in central}} Utah developed {{adjacent to the}} Cordilleran fold and thrust belt between Albian and latest Campanian time. Subsidence resulted from the lithospheric 'oad of coeval thrust sheets to the west. Compositional trends of foreland-basin sandstones record unroofing of stratigraphic sequences above ramp-style detachment thrusts until the middle Campanian, when folding above a frontal blind thrust system caused recycling of previously deposited foreland basin detritus. Basement uplifts within the foreland basin terminated subsidence in latest Campanian <b>time.</b> <b>Thrust</b> loading created a westward-thickening basin in which the sedimentary wedge fines eastward. Coarse-grained synorogenic strata along {{the western edge of}} the basin are included in the Indianola Group, which consists of a lower marine-dominated sequence and an upper fluvial sequence. The marine sequence correlates with the marine Mancos Shale farther east, while the upper fluvial sequence is equivalent to the Mesaverde Group. Individual lithostratigraphic units are time-transgressive, becoming younger eastward. Eight distinct depositional facies are recognized in the Indianola Group: alluvial fan conglomerate, braided fluvial conglomerate, braided fluvial pebbly sandstone, meanderbelt fluvial sandstone and siltstone, delta distributary sandstone, lagoonal sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, nearshore marine sandstone, and open marine mudstone and siltstone. The Mesaverde Group was deposited mostly by sandy to pebbly braided and meandering rivers which transported detritus eastward from the thrust belt. Facies in the basin combine to form an offlapping sequence of eastward-fining clastic wedges. Sandstones of the basin are quartzarenites, sublitharenites, and litharenites derived from the sedimentary source terrane of the thrust belt. Detrital carbonate grains are an important fraction of the sedimentary rock fragments that dominate the lithic population of the sandstones. Feldspathic litharenites high in eastern exposures of the Mesaverde Group were derived from an arc terrane lying beyond the thrust belt. Linear petrographic trends shown by triangular QtFL and QpLsLv plots resulted from mixing of detritus from multiple sources. The age of synorogenic deposits and their succession by a Maastrichtian to Paleocene overlap assemblage indicate that foreland basin subsidence and major thrust faulting were continuous from late Albian through late Campanian time in central Utah...|$|E
40|$|The Systems Analysis Branch {{performs}} trajectory {{and systems}} analysis for next-generation launch vehicle and space transportation technologies. Currently the branch is supporting the Project Prometheus with analysis of nuclear electric and nuclear thermal propulsion missions {{to a variety}} of destinations. Within Project Prometheus a proposed mission to Jupiter and three of the planet sized icy moons that orbit it is developing. The Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) as the project is being called will enable detailed scientific investigation of Jupiter's moons Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa. These moons were choose to orbit for intensive study in particular because they are each believed to have water, energy, and organic material. The JIMO mission will utilize nuclear fission power and electric propulsion in order to allow the spacecraft to orbit the moons at close range for long durations of time. My assignment this summer was to assist in developing a trajectory analysis for the spacecraft system the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter by rewriting an inefficient Excel file into a more efficient FORTRAN program. This program has been created for use planning the trajectory of the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter Mission. The program uses a database of thousands of data points representing flight time, burn <b>time,</b> <b>thrust,</b> mass of the propellant used, final mass of the spacecraft, ratio of finals mass to initial mass, and change in velocity that a spacecraft experiences during each phase in the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter Mission. The trajectory program is capable of taking a specific user entered specific impulse (isp), final mass fraction, and thrust (P(sub J) /m 0) and through the use of cubic splines to fit specific data curves, the program can locate the exact flight time linked to the user specified values of specific impulse and final over initial mass fraction. Currently, the database used by the program to calculate flight times for a given thrust is only for isps in the range of 2000 to 9000 seconds. Although the program is specific to the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter mission, it can be easily modified to fit any mission with a propulsion system expected isp range between 2000 and 9000 seconds. This program performs the same tasks as the old Excel file but in a more timely fashion. Finally, this FORTRAN program will replace the Excel file as the tool used to calculate trajectory properties in missions and will provide valuable data to mission analysts for years to come...|$|E

40|$|Thrust {{generation}} and scaling parameters for flapping flexible wings are investigated using an integrated framework of {{computational fluid dynamics}} and structural dynamics solvers. To explore the influences of the density ratio and the effective stiffness on the thrust generation, surrogate models have been generated for a flapping thin isotropic flat Zimmerman wing in still air at = 1. 5 × 103. <b>Time</b> averaged <b>thrust,</b> bending angle, and twist show qualitatively similar behavior and increased with higher ratio between the density ratio and effective stiffness. Flexibility-induced twisting in the wing promotes the thrust generation. To further investigate the flexibility-induced thrust enhancement, plunging chordwise flexible airfoils in forward flight at = 9. 0 × 103 in water are considered. <b>Time</b> averaged <b>thrust</b> increases with larger airfoil thickness, however the thinnest airfoil responded with degradation in performance when motion frequency becomes high. Finally, unified scaling parameters are proposed based on properly normalized governing equations and give a priori order of magnitude estimation of the <b>time</b> averaged <b>thrust</b> {{and the degree of}} fluid-structure coupling.
