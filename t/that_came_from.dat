5|$|Prior {{to modern}} times, horse breeds {{throughout}} Europe were known {{primarily by the}} name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only difference is the country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.|$|E

The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims.

The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316.

5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day}} of the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E

However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Many early sources {{gave the}} {{scientific}} {{name of the}} dusky shark as Carcharias (later Carcharhinus) lamiella, which originated from an 1882 account by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. Although Jordan and Gilbert referred {{to a set of}} jaws <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> a dusky shark, the type specimen they designated was later discovered to be a copper shark (C. brachyurus). Therefore, C. lamiella is not considered a synonym of C. obscurus but rather of C. brachyurus. Other common names for this species include bay shark, black whaler, brown common gray shark, brown dusky shark, brown shark, common whaler, dusky ground shark, dusky whaler, river whaler, shovelnose, and slender whaler shark.|$|E

5|$|When {{conceived}} {{in the nineteenth}} century, the electric fire engine was proposed to replace the steam fire engine in use at the time. It was to be constructed {{in such a way}} that it would use a supply of electrical power <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points. This would require underground or overhead wiring similar to that used for electric light, trolleys, and other power users of the time. It was thought that the wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current.|$|E
5|$|Yaoi and Yuri (also {{known as}} Boys' Love and Girls' Love, respectively) are Japanese genres {{incorporating}} homosexual romance themes across various media. The genres {{emerged in the}} 1970s in a branch of manga aimed at girls. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri are now available in many countries and languages. The characters in yaoi and yuri manga do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. Famous works include Hiizuredokoro no Tenshi (The Angel <b>that</b> <b>Came</b> <b>from</b> the Sun), an 11-volume series beginning in 1980 that reinterprets {{the life of the}} introducer of Buddhism to Japan; and Kaze to Ki no Uta (Poem of the Wind and the Trees), a 17-volume series beginning in 1976 that chronicles the relationship between two schoolboys in France.|$|E
5|$|Viso {{was issued}} with a drive-through penalty and rejoined in tenth position. The race resumed on lap 54 with Power {{retaining}} his lead. The race's third caution was issued {{shortly after the}} restart when Kanaan made light contact with the side of Tagilani who spun. Mario Romancini was blinded by smoke <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the incident and was hit by Tagilani who was attempting {{to regain control of}} his car. Both cars sustained heavy damage and retired but Kanaan was able to continue without apparent damage. Power led the field back up to speed at the lap-58 restart. Briscoe fell behind the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers, while Tracy moved in front of Hunter-Reay for sixth place. The second (and final) round of green-flag pit stops started on the 63rd lap; Tracy and Hunter-Reay made their pit stops over the next five laps in the hope a caution flag would be shown that would allow the pair to lead the race. After the pit stops, Power remained in the first position, and had the Alternate tires fitted on his car. He was ahead of Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E
