5|$|Eight of {{the nine}} provincial legislatures were won by <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> The EFF {{obtained}} over 10% {{of the vote in}} Gauteng, Limpopo and North West, and beat the DA to second place in the last two. In the other six provinces won by <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> the DA obtained second place. This included KwaZulu-Natal, where the DA for the first time beat the Inkatha Freedom Party to second place. In the Western Cape, the only province not won by <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> the DA increased its majority from 51.5% to 59.4%.|$|E
5|$|IFP {{officials}} stormed an ANC {{office in}} Alexandra and held ANC members hostage after the IFP had realised {{that they had}} lost all previous IFP voting districts to <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ANC</b> office was situated in a multi-purpose centre along with IEC and IFP offices.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ANC</b> {{threatened}} to withdraw support for South Africa's next test match against Australia, {{which could have}} led to the cancellation the match due to safety concerns and Australia stated they would not play if the match didn't have ANC support. However, the future South African sports minister Steve Tshwete asked for <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> to give the supporters another chance and <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> did not withdraw their support. Instead they issued a warning that if it happened again they would oppose all future tours and the 1995 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Mbeki became <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> {{director}} of <b>the</b> Department of Information and Publicity and coordinated diplomatic campaigns to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid activities. In 1989, he {{rose in the}} ranks to head <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> Department of International Affairs and was involved in <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> negotiations with <b>the</b> South African government.|$|R
50|$|After the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC), Manuel was {{appointed}} as deputy co-ordinator in the Western Cape Province. At <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> first regional conference in 1990 Manuel was elected publicity secretary. At <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> 1991 national conference Manuel {{was elected to}} the National Executive Committee. In 1992 Manuel became head of <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> Department of Economic Planning. Manuel was elected as an ANC Member of Parliament in 1994 and {{was appointed}} by President Nelson Mandela as Minister of Trade and Industry; two years later, in 1996, he was moved to the post of Minister of Finance.|$|R

5|$|The Ipsos/Sunday Times survey {{undertaken}} in February and March 2014 showed that <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> enjoyed majority support in all provinces except the Western Cape, where the DA retains majority support. DA support followed that of <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> {{in all other}} provinces except for the North West, where the EFF came in second place.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the DA accused <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> of abusing {{state resources}} after the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) was seen giving out blankets and toiletries at an ANC rally in Parys. ANC spokesperson Khusela Sangoni-Khawe denied the accusation, saying that <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> {{did not know}} SASSA {{would be at the}} rally.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the South Kasaian soldiers were integrated into <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> after {{the dissolution of the}} state but nearly 2,000 loyalists went into hiding to await Kalonji's possible restoration. The rebels were led by General Mwanzambala and fought a guerrilla war against the new provincial government until 1963 when they also accepted integration into <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> Soon {{after the end of the}} secession, the city of Bakwanga was renamed Mbuji-Mayi.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{internal}} poll conducted by the DA with American pollster Stan Greenberg in March–April 2014, <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> would get 59% of the vote, the DA 26% and the EFF 8%.|$|E
5|$|Biko {{endorsed}} {{the unification of}} South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and African National Congress (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, {{he reached out to}} leading members of <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> PAC, and Unity Movement. His communications with <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> were largely via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with the PAC were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement were largely via Fikile Bam.|$|E

50|$|Lembede {{spent a lot}} of {{his time}} {{creating}} the organisations's Manifesto whilst also being elected to be <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> secretary in <b>the</b> Transvaal. The following year Lembede, Tambo and Sisulu went on the attack to defend their ideas of African nationalism and they almost succeeded in getting the communists thrown out of the congress in the Transvaal. Possibly as a result both <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> National Executive seconded him to help them.|$|R
5|$|The Ipsos Pulse of the People survey {{undertaken}} in October and November 2013 {{showed that a}} number of provinces would be closely contested. <b>The</b> <b>ANC</b> will continue to dominate in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Free State. The DA will keep the Western Cape while control of the Northern Cape and Gauteng will be contested between <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> and DA, with other parties holding the balance of power, so coalitions may be decisive. In Limpopo and North West the EFF could become the official opposition.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 161 of 21 February 1961, {{called for}} the {{withdrawal}} of Belgian officers from command positions in <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> and the training of new Congolese officers with UN help. The various efforts made by ONUC to retrain <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> from August 1960 to their effective end in June 1963 are described in Arthur House's book , pages 145-155. By March 1963 however, after the visit of Colonel Michael Greene of the United States Army, and the resulting 'Greene Plan,' the pattern of bilaterally agreed military assistance to various Congolese military components, instead of a single unified effort, was already taking shape.|$|E
5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, {{but during the}} course of the offensive, <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.|$|E

5|$|Allegations of {{genocide}} and brutality by <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> {{were used to}} provide legitimacy to Kasa-Vubu's dismissal of Lumumba, {{with the support of}} Mobutu, in September 1960. In the aftermath of the campaign, the South Kasaian state was able to provide substantial aid to its refugees, many of whom were resettled in homes and jobs.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of <b>the</b> <b>ANC.</b> Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 and 1976, the South African {{government}} conducted delicate {{negotiations with}} neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting {{the activities of}} <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> ZANU and ZAPU. However, increasingly aggressive actions by the Rhodesian army outside its own borders resulted in the failure of this conciliatory approach.|$|E
