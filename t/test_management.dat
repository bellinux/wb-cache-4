The wing lost six aircraft and consolidated the remaining aircraft into the 58th and 60th Fighter Squadrons. Originally selected for inactivation in 1997, Air Force officials delayed the decision {{in recognition of the}} Nomads' connection with Khobar Towers.

The complexities of the core banking system projects lead to that the financial software testing is very complex and difficult. This paper analyzes the traditional software <b>testing</b> <b>management</b> evaluation criteria, and proposes a new evaluation model. By removing the correlation between traditional evaluation criteria, the model can obtain a set of uncorrelated evaluation factors, and these factors can be used for the evaluation of software <b>testing</b> <b>management.</b> Experiments have proved that this model can be more scientific and objective for the evaluation of software <b>testing</b> <b>management</b> in core banking systems programme...|$|R

This work considers network <b>testbed</b> <b>management,</b> and more specifically on <b>testbed</b> <b>management</b> soft-ware for community networks. Because of the inherently unstruc-tured and chaotic nature of community networks, managing com-ponents inside a community network with a frequently varying and unpredictable performance is particularly challenging. This paper focuses on the verification of community network testbed control software which has to cope with these challenges. We show how the application of a container-based unit testing approach has a positive impact on development efforts and testbed stability. I...|$|R

40|$|Measurement-based product <b>testing</b> <b>management</b> systems (MPTMS) {{are widely}} used during {{the life cycle of}} {{products}} to validate the design and test the products. Unfortunately, measurement data from measurement systems are isolated with testing task information in the MPTMSs. Furthermore, the development of MPTMSs often begins from scratch, which leads to low development efficiency and low reusability. To solve the problems mentioned above, an application development framework is designed. The framework supports seamless integration between MPTMSs and measurement systems. Meanwhile, components like resource management, organization <b>management,</b> workflow <b>management,</b> <b>testing</b> task <b>management</b> and process mining are provided to improve the reusability of the framework. The development process of MPTMSs consists of workflow model design, components reuse and user interfaces customization.
