40|$|Mechanical {{responses}} {{produced by}} high potassium solution (high-[K]), noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine (ACh) {{were observed in}} the thoracic aorta and the main pulmonary artery isolated from control and hypercholesterolemic rabbits. In the hypercholesterolemic rabbit, these tissues showed increased contractile sensitivity to high-[K], in comparison with those from the control rabbit. In <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the control rabbit, mechanical removal of the endothelium did not change the contraction to high-[K]. The amplitudes of the contractions produced by NA were decreased in <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the hypercholesterolemic rabbit, while they were enhanced after removal of the endothelium in <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the control rabbit. The endothelium-dependent relaxant response to ACh observed in <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the control rabbit was diminished, abolished or changed to a contraction in <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the hypercholesterolemic rabbit. It is concluded that in vascular <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the rabbit, an increase in contractile sensitivity to high-[K], a decrease in sensitivity to NA and dysfunction of the endothelium to ACh are induced by feeding a high-cholesterol diet and these changes in the vascular tissues may thus {{be involved in the}} hypertension observed during diet-induced atherosclerogenesis...|$|R

5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{registered the}} cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.|$|E

5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> both humans and mice.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of nitric oxide (NO) donors, diethylamine/nitric oxide (DEA/NO) and {{nitroglycerin}} (NTG), on isolated uterine and aortic <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> non-pregnant, mid and late pregnant rats. METHODS: The uterus and thoracic aorta were obtained from non-pregnant (estrous cycle) and pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on day 14 and day 21. The uterine and aortic rings were incubated in organ chambers filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution bubbled with 5 % CO 2 in air for isometric tension recordings. Cumulative concentration-response relationships to DEA/NO and NTG were obtained in the aortic rings contracted with phenylephrine and in spontaneously contracting uterine rings. RESULTS: The sensitivity and the maximal inhibitory effects of DEA/NO {{did not differ in}} aortic tissues of any group. DEA/NO-induced Maximal inhibition of spontaneous contractions of uterine <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> mid-pregnant rats was greater (although not significantly) than in the <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> non-pregnant animals (with similar sensitivity), but it was significantly depressed in <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> late pregnant rats. The sensitivity to and maximal inhibitory effects of NTG were less in aortic <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> late pregnant versus mid-pregnant and non-pregnant rats. In uterine <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> late pregnant rats the effect of NTG was negligible. The inhibitory action of both NO donors was much more pronounced in aortic versus uterine tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine smooth muscle is less sensitive than vascular smooth muscle to NO. Uterine smooth muscle from late pregnant animals demonstrates refractoriness to both DEA/NO and NTG, while vascular smooth muscle from late pregnant animals demonstrates refractoriness to NTG, but not to DEA/NO...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{patterns in}} <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> mid-gestation bovine foetuses produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer show subtle abnormalities in nuclear reprogramming Christine Couldrey, Rita SF Lee * Background: Cloning of cattle by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) {{is associated with}} a high incidence of pregnancy failure characterized by abnormal placental and foetal development. These abnormalities are thought to be due, in part, to incomplete re-setting of the epigenetic state of DNA in the donor somatic cell nucleus to a state that is capable of driving embryonic and foetal development to completion. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation patterns were not appropriately established during nuclear reprogramming following SCNT.

40|$|Scarce {{information}} is available about Neospora caninum oocysts and sporozoites, in part because only small numbers of oocysts have typically been produced by experimentally infected dogs. We hypothesized that I reason for low experimental production of oocysts is that dogs have been fed <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> experimentally infected mice instead of <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> cattle (which are natural intermediate hosts of N. caninum). In this study, 9 dogs were fed <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> N. caninum-infected calves, and oocyst production was compared with 6 dogs that were fed infected mouse carcasses. The number of oocysts produced by dogs that ingested infected calf tissues (mean = 160, 700) was significantly greater (P = 0. 03) {{than the number of}} oocysts shed by dogs that ingested infected mice (mean = 5, 400). The second goal of our experiment was to demonstrate cyclical oral transmission of N. caninum between dogs and cattle.
