30|$|Deviating {{from the}} case of {{voluntary}} adoption of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act, companies regularly make the decision <b>to</b> <b>capitalize</b> these costs or not on a yearly basis for periods after the German Accounting Law Modernization Act. However, we only checked financial statements in the adoption year {{since there was no}} possibility <b>to</b> <b>capitalize</b> R&D costs before, and it is highly probable that companies that plan <b>to</b> <b>capitalize</b> R&D costs will capitalize such costs in the adoption year. Additionally, {{it is important to consider}} that only companies with R&D activities have the option <b>to</b> <b>capitalize.</b> Therefore, we restrict our subsample to companies with R&D activities in the adoption year, and we employ our probit regression approach for this sample of voluntary and mandatory adopters in the adoption year, based on Eq. (9). Then, we estimate propensity scores, which reflect the probability of capitalizing R&D costs. Consistent with our previous approach, we include all firm-year observations of those companies that are either in the treatment or control group.|$|R
