5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings are based on <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> of a country's economy, export growth and {{real effective exchange rate}} (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E

He appointed Frank Willan, a former administrator of Glen Innes Severn Council in 2004, as Commissioner.

5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{degree of}} <b>openness</b> in innovation, ranging from closed to {{multiple}} levels of openness, {{is a key}} strategic decision for managers. Therefore, this study aims to carefully investigate the underlying drivers of openness. A major result {{of this study is}} that <b>the</b> degree of <b>openness</b> underlies separate mechanisms for being closed in innovation and higher degrees of <b>openness.</b> <b>The</b> factors that prevent firms from being open are a lack of market and technological knowledge (knowledge gaps), ineffective intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms, and competitor threats such as market entries and imitation. The most important factors that increase <b>the</b> degree of <b>openness</b> are a firm's need for financial funding in innovation and the effectiveness of a firm's IP protection mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies that}} have {{examined}} <b>the</b> relationship between <b>Openness</b> and crystallized ability have failed to account statistically {{for the fact that}} subtests commonly regarded as measures of crystallized intelligence (e. g., Vocabulary) are contaminated substantially by general intelligence. A method using residuals derived from a regression is proposed as a means to estimate crystallized ability. Further, self-reported intelligence was hypothesized to moderate or mediate <b>the</b> correlation between <b>Openness</b> and crystallized intelligence. It was found that two factors (General and Objective) could be derived from a principal components analysis (PCA) of <b>the</b> six <b>Openness</b> facets and that only Objective Openness correlated with intelligence. Using the residual approach to estimating crystallized ability, it was found that Objective Openness correlated with only g and not crystallized ability. The self-report intelligence measure correlated only with <b>the</b> General <b>Openness</b> factor. Based on {{the results of this study}} and a review of the empirical literature, it is argued that Openness should be correlated with g and that this correlation should exist based on theory. It is recommended that future research use the residual approach to estimating crystallized ability, and that a new emphasis on understanding <b>the</b> relationship between <b>Openness</b> and g is required...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> trade <b>openness</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} determinants of a country’s relative level of eco-nomic health. It plays a vital role for most free market economies in the world. This research is an attempt to investigate, particularly, the impact of <b>the</b> trade <b>openness</b> on <b>the</b> economic growth in Niger; and generally, the relationship between all the variables under study. Four (4) variables namely real economic growth rate represented by real gross domestic product growth rate (GDPGR), trade openness (TRDOP), real exchange rate (REEXR) and foreign direct investment (FDI) have been considered in the model. The paper used time series data covering the period from 1980 to 2013 as well as time series methods for the econometric analyses. The results show that there exists a long term relationship between all the variables; the independent variables affects the economic growth in the short-run; only <b>the</b> trade <b>openness</b> and <b>the</b> real exchange rate influ-ence economic growth unidirectionally; except foreign direct investment (FDI), all the variables have explanatory power on economic growth in Niger. The implication of this study is that <b>the</b> trade <b>openness</b> has been efficient to spur the economic growth in Niger over the period of study...|$|R
