5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me in {{many ways}} was a pivotal film for the Bond franchise, and was plagued since its {{conception}} by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer Harry Saltzman, who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise in 1975 for £20million. Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> his wife's terminal cancer {{and many of the}} symptoms of clinical depression in himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are {{generally}} known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually {{a part of a}} different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost. Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters {{to a greater extent than}} earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.|$|E

She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> life.|$|E

5|$|A modernist painter, Bellette was {{influential}} in mid-twentieth century Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes {{influenced by the}} Greek <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> Euripides and Sophocles and the epics of Homer. The only woman to have won the Sulman Prize more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with For Whom the Bell Tolls, and in 1944 with Iphigenia in Tauris. She helped found the Blake Prize for Religious Art, and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist and critic Paul Haefliger in 1935. The couple moved to Majorca in 1957; although she visited and exhibited in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E
5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the flood event in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris, raising their water levels and widening their banks. In a post-disaster assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed: reforestation, contoured farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} {{it is argued}} that {{bridging}} the digital divide may cause a new ethical and social dilemma. Using Hardin’s <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> the Commons, we show that an improper opening and enlargement of the digital environment (Infosphere) is likely to produce a <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> the Digital Commons (TDC). In the course of the analysis, we explain why Adar and Huberman’s previous use <b>of</b> Hardin’s <b>Tragedy</b> to interpret certain recent phenomena in the Infosphere (especially peer-to-peer communication) may not be entirely satisfactory. We then seek to provide an improved version of the TDC that avoids the possible shortcomings of their model. Next, we analyse some problems encountered by the application of classical ethics in the resolution of the TDC. In the conclusion, we outline the kind of work that will be required to develop an ethical approach that may bridge the digital divide but avoid the TDC.

40|$|Garrett Hardin’s <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> the Commons {{argument}} {{states that}} resources held in common will inevitably suffer overexploitation and degradation.

The paper compares the validity <b>of</b> the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> the commons hypothesis in three marine cases: California fisheries, modern Oregon fisheries and European Union Common Fisheries Policy.
