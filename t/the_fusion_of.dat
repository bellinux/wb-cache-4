5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 are based on <b>the</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> two 10-atom clusters.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the precipitation characteristics of a phase in <b>the</b> <b>fusion</b> zone <b>of</b> stainless steel welds at various welding passes during a tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process. The morphology, quantity, and chemical composition of the delta-ferrite and sigma phase were analyzed using optical microscopy (OM), a ferritscope (FS), a X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), and a wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS), respectively. Massive delta-ferrite was observed in <b>the</b> <b>fusion</b> zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first pass welds during welding of dissimilar stainless steels.
