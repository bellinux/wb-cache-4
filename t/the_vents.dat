5|$|The high plains {{found on}} Triton's eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, and are {{therefore}} almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as Leviathan Patera, which are probably <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.|$|E
5|$|Black Christmas {{has three}} {{alternate}} endings, {{the second of}} which {{was used as the}} actual ending for the UK theatrical release of the movie. In the UK ending, Billy dies on the operating table from his wounds, thus when Kelli kills Agnes, the scene ends there with her parents picking her up from the hospital. The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through <b>the</b> <b>vents,</b> indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E
40|$|A {{parachute}} {{having an}} improved vent line stacking wherein the parachute {{is provided with}} a canopy having a central vent opening and a vent band secured to the canopy around the periphery of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> opening, with a plurality of vent lines each lying on a diameter of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> opening and having its ends secured to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band {{on opposite sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> opening is described. <b>The</b> <b>vent</b> lines are sewed to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band in an order such that the end of a first vent line is sewed to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band at a starting point with the end of a second vent band then being sewed to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and counterclockwise from the first band. A third vent band is sewed to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and clockwise from the first band, with a fourth vent band being sewed to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and counterclockwise from <b>the</b> second <b>vent</b> band. It can be seen that, if <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> lines are numbered in the order of being sewed to <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> band, <b>the</b> odd numbered <b>vent</b> lines will run consecutively in a clockwise direction and the even numbered lines will run consecutively in a counterclockwise direction from the starting point. With this order of assembly, each and every vent line will be separated from adjacent vent lines by no more than one <b>vent</b> line in <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> opening where <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> lines cross...|$|R

5|$|The Trout Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene. <b>The</b> <b>vents</b> produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land {{now known as the}} Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.|$|E
5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E

50|$|The steam strips the {{dissolved}} {{gas from the}} boiler feedwater and exits via <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> valve at <b>the</b> top of the domed section. Should this vent valve not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> valve not being far enough open. Some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in <b>the</b> <b>vented</b> gas. <b>The</b> <b>vent</b> line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with <b>the</b> <b>vented</b> gases to provide a small visible telltale plume of steam.|$|R
50|$|The {{spatter cone}} caves are located at <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> for <b>the</b> Horse system. Characterized by small and short surface tubes or blister cavities. Most of the spatter cone caves are within {{a foot or}} two of the surface, and lie in or {{adjacent}} to the spatter cones of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> area.

25|$|When Alvin {{inspected}} one of {{the sites}} they located, the scientists observed black smoke billowing out of <b>the</b> <b>vents,</b> something not observed at the Galápagos Rift. Ballard and geophysicist Jean Francheteau went down in Alvin {{the day after the}} black smokers were first observed. They were able to take an accurate temperature reading of the active vent (the previous dive's thermometer had melted), and recorded 350°C (662°F). They continued searching for more vents along the East Pacific Rise between 1980 and 1982.|$|E
25|$|The Body: Neapolitan jackets {{tend to be}} shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, {{they say}} the jacket “zompa arrèto,” which roughly {{translates}} as “it jumps in the back”. This characteristic allows for the jacket to “slide” gracefully along the body. <b>The</b> <b>vents</b> on the sides are quite deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The darts in the front {{go all the way}} down, to help the fabric follow the shape of the body and create elegant quarters.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{destination}} is the Salton Sea mud pots and volcanoes. These mud pots and volcanoes {{are located in}} an open field {{on the eastern side}} of the Salton Sea. The mud is just above ambient temperature and you can walk right up to <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> However, this is a natural system and temperatures will vary. Caution is advised. The location is host to a number of gray cones reaching heights of six feet (2 m) and depressions filled with bubbling mud. These features are the result of the geothermal activity in the area.|$|E

50|$|Spatter cones {{are built}} out of thicker lava. The lava is thrown out of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> and builds, layer by layer, a chimney {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b> Fleener Chimneys and Black Crater are examples of spatter cones.|$|R
25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> pipe.

However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see {{is at the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> pipe. Since <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|R
25|$|The five active {{chimneys}} of Loki's Castle are venting {{water as}} hot as 300 °C (570 °F) and sit on a vast mound of sulfide minerals which is about 825ft (250 m) in diameter at its base, and some 300 feet (90 m) across its top. A member of the 2008 expedition, oceanographer Marvin Lilley has speculated {{that this may be}} the largest such deposit ever seen on the sea floor. The active chimneys are mostly black in colour, but are covered with mats of white bacteria which are living on minerals and materials emitted by <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> The older chimneys are a mottled red colour, due to the presence of deposits of oxidised iron.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his owner Mr. Wing, the mogwai Gizmo becomes the guinea pig of {{scientists}} at Clamp Enterprises, a state-of-the-art office building in Manhattan, run by eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp. At the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter, Gizmo is rescued by his friend Billy Peltzer and his fiancée Kate, both of whom work for the company. Clamp befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in concept design, also sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone. Gizmo is left in the office, where water spills on his head and spawns four new mogwai (George, Lenny, Mohawk and Daffy) who then lock Gizmo in <b>the</b> <b>vents.</b> They eat after midnight, turning into gremlins.|$|E
25|$|On {{either side}} of the {{entrance}} section are recessed narrow Gothic arched windows in molded surrounds set with tinted glass, one horizontal mullion at centre and two curved ones curving inward from the edges, in contrast to those on the entrance transom. On each side of the pavilion is a similarly treated, narrower window. At the roofline of the entrance pavilion is a plain frieze; above it on {{either side of}} the entrance projection are louvered vents. At the eaves of the roof a flap of wood hangs down, broad near the bottom and narrow at the top, following the surround of <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> beneath. Behind the pavilion is a more gently pitched engaged gabled face with vertica battens.|$|E

50|$|Some subvolcanic sills in the Thompson Belt of Canada host nickel sulfide {{deposits}} {{formed by}} deposition of sulfides near <b>the</b> feeder <b>vent.</b> Sulfide was accumulated near <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> due to <b>the</b> loss of magma velocity at <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> interface. <b>The</b> massive Voisey's Bay nickel deposit {{is considered to}} have formed via a similar process.|$|R
25|$|The Dragon ambushes Ripley and Clemens in {{the prison}} infirmary, where it kills Clemens. It {{initially}} threatens Ripley but then mysteriously spares her and retreats. Andrews orders Aaron to take {{her back to the}} infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> and killed by the monster. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the extraterrestrial. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of a xenomorph queen growing inside her.

Moss is eventually killed by Mexican hitmen while in a motel in El Paso. Once again Moss hid the money in <b>the</b> <b>vents,</b> which was unseen by the Mexicans {{at the time of their}} ambush. Chigurh shows up later after the police have left, retrieves the money from the vent, and gives it back to the investor.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} all this effort could only be judged after a complicated, {{three-phase}} firing process which generated the red color of the vase clay and the black of the applied slip. Specifically, the vessel was fired in a kiln at a temperature of about 800°C, with the resultant oxidization turning the vase a reddish-orange color. The temperature was then raised to about 950°C with the kiln's vents closed and green wood added to remove the oxygen. The vessel then turned an overall black. The final stage required <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> to be re-opened to allow oxygen into the kiln, which was allowed to cool down. The vessel then returned to its reddish-orange colour due to renewed oxidization, while the now-sintered painted layer remained the glossy black color which had been created in the second stage.|$|E
25|$|Lava domes and coulées are {{associated}} with felsic lava flows ranging from dacite to rhyolite. The very viscous nature of these lava cause them to not flow far from <b>the</b> <b>vent,</b> causing <b>the</b> lava to form a lava dome at <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b> When a dome forms on an inclined surface it can flow in short thick flows called coulées (dome flows). These flows often travel only a few kilometers from <b>the</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|R

25|$|This natural {{ventilation}} {{process can be}} augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has {{to be higher than}} the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a glazed surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface {{is more important than the}} diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> in the chimney should face away from the direction of the prevailing wind.|$|E
25|$|Only priests {{attached}} to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed {{on at least one}} side and has a double domed roof. The double dome has vents to allow the smoke to escape, but <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> of the outer dome are offset from those of the inner, so preventing debris or rain from entering the inner sanctum. The sanctum is separated from the anteroom by dividers (or walls with very large openings) and is slightly raised with respect to the space around it. The wall(s) of the inner sanctum are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are no lights – other than that of the fire itself – in the inner sanctum. In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|Waistcoats (called vests in American English) {{were almost}} always worn with suits {{prior to the}} 1940s. Due to {{rationing}} during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone {{in and out of}} fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress (white tie). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like <b>the</b> <b>vents</b> in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels, others do not.|$|E

The {{reason for this is}} {{in the event of a}} plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down <b>the</b> <b>vent,</b> possibly plugging <b>the</b> <b>vent</b> (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|R
