The basis of this study is the base on commitment-trust theory with <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> of consumers’ satisfaction with the micro-blog page of enterprises, corporate images, commitment, trust, and sense of community on consumers’ behavioral intention. The result of this study can be used as principles for enterprises to manage their relationship marketing through micro-blogging and construct their micro-blog page. The result of this study shows that consumers’ satisfaction has positive influences on commitment, trust, sense of community, and behavioral intentions. <b>The</b> <b>influences</b> of corporate images on commitment and trust are supported, but <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> on behavioral intentions must go through the mediators, commitment and trust. <b>The</b> <b>influences</b> of trust on commitment and sense of community exist, but <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> on behavioral intentions must go through the mediators, commitment and sense of community.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the existing relationship between <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> agent and <b>the</b> target of <b>influence</b> plays {{a central role in}} the choice of using hard and soft influence tactics. In a field study, 3 key aspects of the relation between agent and target were examined. and the results generally supported our hypotheses. First, the more unfairly people felt they were treated, the more often they wielded influence, especially using harder <b>influence</b> tactics. Second. <b>the</b> better <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> agent liked <b>the</b> target. the relatively less often he or she used hard tactics. Finally, <b>the</b> more <b>the</b> <b>influencing</b> agent felt dependent upon the target, <b>the</b> fewer <b>influence</b> tactics, both hard and soft, were used. The discussion focuses on both the practical and theoretical implications of these findings...|$|R
