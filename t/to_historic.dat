5|$|Built {{on top of}} an {{alluvial}} fan that had been host <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the two types of}} classification within historic districts, properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object; each one has a specific definition in relation to the National Register. All but the eponymous district category are also applied <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> districts listed on the National Register.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of present-day Chesham grew between the railway {{station and the}} Old Town, leaving the {{architecture}} of the Old Town almost untouched. In June 2009 the Old Town and the present-day town centre were added <b>to</b> <b>Historic</b> England's Conservation Areas at Risk Register, although the local authority claimed that this was owing to a misunderstanding of its responses to English Heritage's questionnaire.|$|E

5|$|About 900 {{vehicles}} {{crossed the}} bridge each day. The bridge collected {{an average of}} $30,000 in monthly tolls and had $22,000 in monthly expenses. The bridge {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2007 in part because of its relationship <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> New Harmony, Indiana as well as the bridge's age. The three-member Commission was established by Congress on April 12, 1941, but Congress repealed the statute providing for an appointment mechanism in 1998. The Commission's general manager, who is 75, speculated that the bridge would close if the three current commissioners would resign or die.|$|E
5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, {{even though they had}} not been flooded. Little regard was given <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> preservation, as the priority was thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E

5|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, raptor populations {{in urban areas}} are highly beneficial. Compared with Europe where pigeon populations have exploded to the point they are both a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Their faeces are highly acidic causing damage <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> buildings and statues made of soft stone. They nest in bridges where it compiles and damages iron work causing rust and corrosion. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough to ward off pigeon nest building in major highrises.|$|E
5|$|Gary Schiff (born February 3, 1972, as Gary J. Schiffhauer) is an American {{politician}} and activist who represented Ward 9 on the Minneapolis City Council. A {{member of the}} Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), he was first elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 and 2009. Prior to his political career, Schiff was involved {{with a variety of}} activist groups and causes ranging from human rights with the Human Rights Campaign, <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> preservation with Save Our Shubert.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a historic preservation program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory in good condition. Although no historic preservation program was in effect, no threats <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E

5|$|Loch Leven Castle was {{strengthened}} in the 14th {{or early}} 15th century, {{by the addition}} of the five-storey tower house or keep. According <b>to</b> <b>Historic</b> Scotland, it is of the 14th century, {{making it one of the}} oldest tower houses in Scotland which still substantially survives. In 1390 King Robert II (reigned 1371–1390) granted the castle to Sir Henry Douglas, the husband of his niece Marjory. From the 14th century, the castle served as a state prison. Prior to becoming king, Robert II was held here in 1369, as was Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas (d. 1439) in the first half of the 15th century. Patrick Graham, Archbishop of St Andrews, died in captivity at the castle in 1478.|$|E

The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) is located in La Jolla and has a branch located at the Santa Fe Depot downtown. The downtown branch consists of two building on two opposite streets. The Columbia district downtown is home <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> ship exhibits belonging to the San Diego Maritime Museum, headlined by the Star of India, as well as the unrelated San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum featuring the USS Midway aircraft carrier.|$|E

The two-act show consisted of interpretations of village life by village organizations and a revue of Briarcliff Manor history in skits and songs. Other society-sponsored events have included tours {{of homes and}} churches, bus tours, Hudson River cruises on historic boats such as the M/V Commander (built in 1917 and listed on the national and state registers of historic places), dances, antique-car exhibits, day trips <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> points of interest, art exhibits, and events with authors and elected officials.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed by a ship about 835mi (1,345km) northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana, early on August6, according <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> weather maps. However, {{the scarcity of}} observations means that its genesis may have occurred earlier than this time and been undetected operationally. With initial winds of 60mph (95km/h), the system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale about 24hours later. The first indication of the storm {{to the east of}} Barbados was on August8 via telegraph reports. Early on August9, the cyclone struck Martinique as either a strong Category1 or a weak Category2 hurricane. The storm entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Around 12:00UTC, the cyclone intensified into a Category3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the second storm of 1900 and the first in the Caribbean Sea since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to private development, several joint-development affordable housing projects {{have recently been}} constructed along the Metrorail line {{with the intent of}} increasing ridership through transit-oriented development. These projects include Santa Clara apartments, Brownsville Transit Village, and The Beacon, which is located near Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station in Downtown Miami. The headquarters of Miami-Dade Transit, also located next <b>to</b> <b>Historic</b> Overtown/Lyric Theater Station, is known as the Overtown Transit Village. Brownsville Transit Village, opening in March 2012, was visited by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lisa P. Jackson, on January 5, 2012 to tour the 490-unit development, which will save an estimated five million gallons of water and $50,000 annually in utility bills due to environmentally sustainable plumbing fixtures. Nonetheless, by 2016, Brownsville and Santa Clara were still the lowest ridership stations, the only ones to regularly post ridership numbers below 1,000 daily. In general, stations to the north of Civic Center see much lower ridership, on average one-third of stations from Civic Center south. They are mostly in industrial areas with low population density and little development, as well as stagnant or declining populations, such as Gladeview and Brownsville. Additionally, stations to the north of Earlington Heights are only served by one line, giving them much longer headways.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel <b>to</b> <b>historic</b> gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
