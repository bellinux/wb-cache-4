5|$|That evening Kouma led {{the patrol}} of two M26 Pershing tanks and two M19 Gun Motor Carriages in Agok, along the Naktong River. Kouma placed his patrol {{on the west}} side of Agok near the Kihang ferry. At 20:00 a heavy fog covered <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> at 22:00 mortar shells began falling on the American-held side of the river. By 22:15 this strike {{intensified}} and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company's positions. American mortars and artillery began firing counter-battery.

5|$|The brigade {{was ordered}} to assault <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> capture a crossing. On 24 November the regiment, with the 8th Squadron leading, crossed the ford at the river mouth. Taken by surprise, the Turkish {{defenders}} retired, and were followed by the regiment, who galloped into the nearby foothills and captured the village of Sheikh Muannis. The rest of the brigade continued the attack along the river, capturing the other crossings. To support their defence, the 161st (Essex) Brigade moved {{to the north of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> dug in. The regiment sent mounted patrols forward to observe the surrounding country.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} {{movement in the}} American Southwest has opposed the damming and diversion of the Colorado River system because of {{detrimental effects on the}} ecology and natural beauty of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> its tributaries. During the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{shifting}} Columbia Bar makes passage between <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> the Pacific Ocean {{difficult and}} dangerous, and numerous rapids {{along the river}} hinder navigation. Pacific Graveyard, a 1964 book by James A. Gibbs, describes the many shipwrecks {{near the mouth of}} the Columbia. Jetties, first constructed in 1886, extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-profile}} {{success for}} the company came in the 1960s, again in Egypt. The rising waters of the River Nile (a result {{of the construction of}} the Aswan High Dam) threatened the ancient Abu Simbel temple complex.

5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight.

5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> the parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry.

5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved {{that it was possible}} to cross the Columbia Bar.

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> roads were built along these many centuries ago.

An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
