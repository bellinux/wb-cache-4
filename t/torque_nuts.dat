50|$|A locknut, {{also known}} as a lock nut, locking nut, {{prevailing}} torque nut, stiff nut or elastic stop nut, is a nut that resists loosening under vibrations and torque. Elastic stop nuts and prevailing <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> are of the particular type where some portion of the nut deforms elastically to provide a locking action. The first type used fiber instead of nylon and was invented in 1931.|$|E
40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of prevailing <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of prevailing torque when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the prevailing torque when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for prevailing <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, prevailing <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|E
40|$|Prevailing <b>torque</b> <b>nuts</b> are an {{extremely}} popular method of providing resistance to vibration-induced self-loosening of fasteners. Such nuts have a self-contained prevailing torque feature {{that provides a}} degree of resistance to rotation. Although such nuts are frequently used, it is not widely realized that they can occasionally come completely detached from bolts. The mechanism by which this can occur has hitherto been unidentified since {{it has not been}} possible to replicate detachment under laboratory testing. This article identifies a general condition that can result in the complete loosening and detachment of prevailing torque type nuts. This mechanism involves the application of an axial load when transverse joint slip is occurring. This article describes a modified Junker test machine that allows the application of axial loading to a joint while experiencing transverse displacement. Tests have been completed using an intermittent as well as a constant axial load. Loading in both modes has been demonstrated to result in the complete detachment of this nut type. Based on this investigation, if the magnitude of the axial loading exceeds the residual preload in the bolt retained from sustaining transverse movement alone, the all-metal type of prevailing torque nut can completely detach. Applications that involve shear and axial loading being simultaneously applied to a joint are numerous in engineering...|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of nuts exists, from {{household}} hardware versions to specialized industry-specific designs that are engineered to meet various technical standards. Fasteners used in automotive, engineering, and industrial applications usually need to be tightened to a specific torque setting, using a <b>torque</b> wrench. <b>Nuts</b> are graded with strength ratings compatible with their respective bolts; for example, an ISO property class 10 nut {{will be able to}} support the bolt proof strength load of an ISO property class 10.9 bolt without stripping.

This exposed area of unpassivated metal is not dissimilar to the area exposed by the threads and torqued compressions between the rod and the pedicle screws or cross connectors.

40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for <b>torquing</b> a <b>nut</b> or a bolt...|$|R
50|$|Due to the accident, on August 25, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered {{emergency}} {{inspections of}} wing leading-edge slat tracks on all Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft. The Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) from the FAA requires operators {{to inspect the}} slat track downstop to check for missing parts, ensure proper installation, and check {{the inside of the}} slat can for foreign object debris and damage. The directive requires operators to inspect within 24 days and every 3000 flight cycles thereafter. Following feedback from completed inspections revealing loose parts in several other aircraft and one with a damaged slat can, the FAA issued a new emergency airworthiness directive on August 28. Airlines were then required to perform the inspection on Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft within 10 days instead of 24 days. In addition, the AD required a one-time <b>torquing</b> of the <b>nut</b> and bolt in the downstop assembly for the slat track within 24 days.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to apply the loads (the stirring and the resection forces and torques) in self-reacted friction stir welding. This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below. The tooling needed to apply the large reaction loads in conventional friction stir welding can be complex. Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs. The main problems inherent in self-reacted friction stir welding originate in the high stresses encountered by the pin-and-shoulder assembly that produces the weld. The design of the present mechanism solves the problems. The mechanism includes a redesigned pin-and-shoulder assembly. The welding torque is transmitted into the welding pin by a square pin that fits into a square bushing with set-screws. The opposite or back shoulder is held in place by a Woodruff key and high-strength nut on a threaded shaft. The Woodruff key reacts the <b>torque,</b> while the <b>nut</b> reacts the tensile load on the shaft...|$|R
40|$|A {{pump system}} of the {{reciprocating}} piston type is described, which facilitates direct motor drive and cylinder sealing. A threaded middle potion of the piston is engaged by a nut connected to rotate with the rotor of an electric motor, {{in a manner that}} minimizes loading on the rotor by the use of a coupling that transmits <b>torque</b> to the <b>nut</b> but permits it to shift axially and radially with respect to the rotor. The nut has a threaded hydrostatic bearing for engaging the threaded piston portion, with an oil-carrying groove in the nut being interrupted. A fluid emitting seal located at the entrance to each cylinder, can serve to center the piston within the cylinder, wash the piston, and to aid in sealing. The piston can have a long stroke to diameter ratio to minimize reciprocations and wear on valves at high pressures. The voltage applied to the motor can be reversed prior to the piston reaching the end of its stroke, to permit pressure on the piston to aid in reversing the motor...|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct <b>torque.</b> The inner <b>nut</b> is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a thin nut (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|R
40|$|Research {{has been}} {{completed}} to establish the effect which the clamping force, resulting from <b>torque</b> tightening a <b>nut</b> and bolt, has on the fracture strength and the stress intensity geometry factor of a fastener hole containing a symmetrical pair of edge cracks. The work has involved the carrying out of a programme of experimental tests and also the conducting of a numerical study. The tests were carried out using specimens made from aluminum alloy, grade AL 7075 -T 6 rectangular plate containing a central hole with fatigue propagated edge cracks. Three batches of specimens were produced, one without a bolt inserted (for the purpose as a benchmark) and two with nut and bolts fitted but with different tightening torques applied. The joint fracture strengths were obtained using a tensile testing machine. In the numerical investigation, a finite element package was used to model the three test specimen variants used and thereby establish their stress intensity geometry factors. The numerical analyses considered the effect of parameters such as the coefficient of friction between contacting surfaces and {{the magnitude of the}} remotely applied axial load. The results show that the bolt tightening torque, and hence the plate clamping force, has a significant effect on reducing the stress intensity factor, and thus the joint fracture strength compared to bolt-less specimens...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{modelling}} polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) locally and on a cell scale. The modelling was done using software based on the finite element method and focused on mass transfer issues and compression pressure distribution {{and its effects on}} local phenomena. Mass transfer, more specifically the flow distribution in the flow field system, was studied on the cathode. The velocity distribution was improved by changing the geometry of the channel system. This improvement was also observed experimentally. Mass transport problems of free-breathing fuel cells were also studied. These cells rely on free convection to provide reactants and remove reaction products. In this thesis, the aim was to develop an accurate model that is also computationally light. The compression distribution in a stack was modelled based on an existing stack design. The results showed poor internal pressure distribution, with most of the cell experiencing insufficient compression. The modelling was then used to find a better end plate structure and suitable <b>torques</b> for the <b>nut</b> and bolt assemblies. The results were validated experimentally. The effect of compression was studied on a local scale on which compression variations caused by the channel structure had been seen to affect the gas diffusion layer properties and contact resistances between components. According to the modelling results, there are strong local transversal electric currents in the cell. This phenomenon can affect the cell performance and lifetime negatively...|$|R

30|$|As {{the designs}} for timber {{structures}} grow larger and larger, contractors are increasingly using lag screw connectors in their projects [1]. The benefits of lag screw joints include less loosening and slippage when a load is first applied than bolted timber joints; however, they also require more caution, making construction management {{an important consideration}} [2]. For example, screwing in a lag screw without first drilling a pilot hole can cause the timber member to crack, or driven in using a hammer. In addition, overtightening beyond a lag screw’s pullout strength risks damaging the joint, weakening it compared with its original performance. One potential solution to prevent the latter scenario is to apply a torque control method to provide suitable torque {{by means of a}} torque wrench or other tool. However, no one has yet developed a torque control method for lag screw timber joints: contractors today rely on their own experiences and intuition when tightening lag screw connectors, an arbitrary judgment. Torque control methods involve different tightening speeds, because tools such as <b>torque</b> wrenches and <b>nut</b> runners are turned manually to provide torque. For metallic bolted joints, differences in tightening speed are known to result in different coefficients of friction and torque, important factors that determine the feasibility of a given torque control method as well as in variation in axial force (“clamp force” below) [3]. In a previous study on bolted timber joints, we discovered that the torque coefficient decreases at higher tightening speeds and were able to reduce fluctuations in the clamp force by setting the tightening speed to 20  rpm [4]. For lag screw timber joints, however, {{there appears to be no}} research that has clarified the effects of tightening speed on the torque coefficient. This point needs to be clarified, since construction management is more important for lag screw timber joints than for bolt joints, and because no torque control method has been established for lag screw timber joints. In a previous study, we developed a high damping shear wall in which timber members were joined together, or to steel plates, with lag screws or bolts. Tightening generates a clamp force, which in turn generates a frictional resistance force between two timber members, or between one and a steel plate [5]. Our later research investigated how to apply torque control methods to control this clamp force, a serious issue that must be addressed to control the expression of this frictional resistance force [6, 7]. One of the resulting challenges we faced in developing our high damping shear wall was how to determine the effects of lag screw tightening speed on the joint’s torque coefficient.|$|R
