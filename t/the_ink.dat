5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ink</b> sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces <b>the</b> <b>ink,</b> and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> sac.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, {{but they can also}} use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> sac. <b>The</b> <b>ink</b> is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>inks</b> used {{in digital}} {{printing}} on glass mimic the CMYK color model and {{are made of}} ceramic frit and inorganic pigments and elements. <b>The</b> development of <b>inks</b> is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in replication of <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> results in high compatibility with the entire color palette of <b>inks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>inks</b> can therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise outcome of the color every time. Printed glass panels can also be replaced when necessary without {{the risk of the}} new panels not matching the colors of the existing panels. <b>The</b> <b>inks</b> are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development and the application of <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> required innovations both in science and technology.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} thing that should be noted is the colour of <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> at <b>the</b> ISO specified density i.e. C 0.9, M 0.9, Y 0.9 and K 1.1.

40|$|In <b>the</b> {{development}} of <b>inks</b> for printed electronics, {{it is important}} to understand the behaviour of <b>the</b> functional <b>inks</b> and more especially their rheology and surface properties. This project emphasises <b>the</b> importance of <b>ink</b> characterization by performing rheological tests on silicon nanoparticle based inks that are used in the screen printing of electronic devices. <b>The</b> <b>inks</b> were characterized for linear viscoelastic behaviour, flow behaviour, change in properties with angular frequency, as well as thixotropic behaviour. All showed shear thinning, with <b>the</b> more dilute <b>inks</b> showing a power law (Ostwald / de Waele model) behaviour dependence of complex viscosity on angular frequency. The flow behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> was also seen to follow a Windhab model. The printability of <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> primarily depends on the shear-dependent viscosity as highly viscous and dilute inks do not produce good printed structures. The printed layers showed electrical and optical activity...|$|R
5|$|Barbera took art {{classes at}} the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired to work in <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> and paint {{department}} of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades, and Tom and Jerry. This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ramírez {{arrived to}} Puerto Rico and almost {{immediately}} {{was named to the}} office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico. Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the fact that only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that emphasizes that the designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used in}} {{carborundum}} printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. Carborundum grit {{is applied}} in a paste {{to the surface of}} an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. <b>The</b> <b>ink</b> plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E

5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E
5|$|Several actors of {{film and}} video games lent their voices to Fallout 3, {{including}} Liam Neeson as James, Ron Perlman as the game's narrator, Malcolm McDowell as President John Henry Eden, Craig Sechler as Butch DeLoria, Erik Todd Dellums as Three Dog, and Odette Yustman as Amata Almodovar. Veteran voice actors Dee Bradley Baker, Wes Johnson, Paul Eiding, and Stephen Russell also provided voice-overs for the game. The Fallout 3 soundtrack continued the series' convention of featuring sentimental 1940s American big band music, including the main theme, {{and a few other}} incidental songs recorded by <b>The</b> <b>Ink</b> Spots and The Andrews Sisters, as well as other artists like Roy Brown, Billie Holiday, Billy Munn, Cole Porter, and Bob Crosby.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E

During that time, they also provided <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> for <b>the</b> 1982 Marvel mini-series Vision and the Scarlet Witch.

25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic printing, intaglio printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. <b>The</b> <b>inks</b> are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable <b>the</b> <b>inks</b> of <b>the</b> offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|R

5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised {{it was because of the}} chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in <b>the</b> <b>ink.</b> He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> too thin, the pen would leak or <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> would smear. Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{currency}} does, however, bear several anti-counterfeiting features. Two of {{the most}} critical anti-counterfeiting features of U.S. currency are the paper and <b>the</b> <b>ink.</b> The composition of the paper is 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. <b>The</b> <b>ink</b> and paper combine to create a distinct texture, particularly as the currency is circulated. The paper and <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> alone have no effect on {{the value of the dollar}} until post print. These characteristics can be hard to duplicate without the proper equipment and materials. Furthermore, recent redesigns of the $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes have added EURion constellation patterns which can be used by scanning software to recognize banknotes and refuse to scan them.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of these components {{can be compared}} with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ball point tip delivers <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> to the writing surface while acting as a buffer between <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.|$|E
50|$|Hand presses {{generally}} required {{two people}} to operate them: one to <b>ink</b> <b>the</b> type, the other to work the press. Later mechanized jobbing presses require a single operator to feed and remove the paper, as <b>the</b> <b>inking</b> and pressing are done automatically.|$|R

25|$|In addition, {{surveying}} the sets of photographs and comparing them to {{images of the}} Vossius book taken in 2000, Scott G.

25|$|Typefaces {{may also}} be {{designed}} differently considering the type of paper on which they will be printed. Designs to be printed on absorbent newsprint paper will be more slender as <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> will naturally spread out as it absorbs into the paper, and may feature ink traps: areas left blank into which <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> will soak as it dries. These corrections will not be needed for printing on high-gloss cardboard or display on-screen. Fonts designed for low-resolution displays, meanwhile, may avoid pure circles, fine lines and details a screen cannot render.|$|E

Because in practice <b>the</b> CMY <b>inks</b> suitable for printing also reflect {{a little bit of}} color, making a deep and neutral black impossible, <b>the</b> K (black <b>ink)</b> component, usually printed last, is needed to compensate for their deficiencies. Use of a separate black ink is also economically driven when a lot of black content is expected, e.g. in text media, to reduce simultaneous use of <b>the</b> three colored <b>inks.</b> <b>The</b> dyes used in traditional color photographic prints and slides are much more perfectly transparent, so a K component is normally not needed or used in those media.|$|R
