2500|$|... "We were like, [...] "Yeah, okay!” My dad <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{pawn shop}} and {{got me a}} Sears Roebuck guitar with a little {{matching}} amp. That was my first rig -- a complete and total thrill. Jean and I flipped a coin to see who would play bass in the band. (laughs) I won, so I got to stay on guitar. We learned to play by {{listening to the radio}} and by hanging out with boys who were in bands. We were 15 or 16 at the time.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Radner {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, to Jewish parents, Henrietta (née Dworkin), a legal secretary, and Herman Radner, a {{business}}man. Through her mother, Radner was a second cousin of business executive Steve Ballmer. She grew up in Detroit with a nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, whom she called [...] "Dibby" [...] (and on whom she based her famous character Emily Litella), and an older brother named Michael. She attended the exclusive University Liggett School in Detroit (it began its relocation to Grosse Pointe later that year). Toward {{the end of her}} life, Radner wrote in her autobiography, It's Always Something, that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: [...] "I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and she <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> doctor who put me on Dexedrine diet pills when I was ten years old." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! well," [...] she declared, [...] "I shall like work, I am convinced. Julien, you are spoiling me. I am {{sure this}} is a cuisine de luxe. I told you <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cheap restaurant." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kravitz began {{banging on}} {{pots and pans}} in the kitchen, playing them as drums {{at the age of}} three. At the age of five, {{he wanted to be a}} musician. He began playing the drums and soon added guitar. Kravitz grew up {{listening}} to the music his parents listened to: R, jazz, classical, opera, gospel, and blues. [...] "My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and they <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of shows," [...] Kravitz said. Around the age of seven, he saw The Jackson 5 perform at Madison Square Garden, which became his favorite group. His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, Miles Davis and other jazz greats. Ellington even played [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] for him one year when he was about 5. He was exposed to the soul music of Motown, Stax, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Gladys Knight, The Isley Brothers, and Gamble and Huff growing up who were key influences on his musical style. Kravitz often went to see New York theater, where his mother worked. His mother encouraged his dreams of pursuing music.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though a}} surf group, they added an {{appealing}} Latin accent to their music. According to band member John Barbata, as mentioned in Craig Fenton's <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Circus Tent: The Jefferson Airplane Flight Manual, {{the group was}} actually rhythm and Blues.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes! but I {{am going}} to buy one in London. Dr. Masham says he will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place where the finest knives {{in the world are}} to be bought. It is <b>a</b> great thing <b>to</b> go to London with Dr. Masham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vaucross {{stopped and}} talked to {{me a few minutes}} and then he <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-toned {{restaurant}} to eat dinner. There was music, and then some Beethoven, and Bordelaise sauce, and cussing in French, and frangipangi, and some hauteur and cigarettes. When I am flush I know them places.|$|E
6000|$|... "And say, Man, what do {{you suppose}} she did? Loosened up like a Marcel wave in the surf at Coney. She <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> swell {{dressmaker}} and gave her a la carte to fit me out--money no object. They were rush orders, and madame locked the front door and put the whole force to work.|$|E
60|$|My errand <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> farm-house on {{the road}} which led to Brighton. After {{settling}} my business, I prolonged my walk, though the rain was already beginning to fall. I had nothing on me that would spoil; and, in my present frame of mind, a wet gown was a preferable alternative to returning to the rectory.|$|E
6000|$|Presently: [...] "Come on. Let's beat {{it down to}} Soho for dinner. Or--no! Now {{you shall}} lead me. Show me where you'd go for dinner. And you shall <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> music-hall, and make me enjoy it. Now you teach <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I seem to you so ingenuous?" [...] Julien inquired. [...] "I am {{wondering}} what resources are open <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I might propose to Lady Anne here that she telephone for the gendarmes.

6000|$|... "I {{told him}} that I knew nothing, sir. I {{explained}} that you had not been back to lunch, and that I had not seen you since the morning.

6000|$|I {{confess to}} a strong feeling of reality, when my guide <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> grave where a flat, green, mossy stone, broken across the middle, is reputed to be the grave of Michael Scott. I felt, for the moment, verily persuaded that if the guide would pry {{up one of the}} stones we should see him there, as described:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Annie," [...] said he confidentially, maybe it's one of {{the last}} dreams of booze, but I've a kind of a {{recollection}} of riding in an automobile with a swell guy that <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> house full of eagles and arc lights. He fed me on biscuits and hot air, and then kicked me down the front steps. If it was the d t's, why am I so sore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{text of the}} [...] "Poems on the Naming of Places" [...] {{underwent}} comparatively little alteration in successive editions. Both {{the changes}} in the first poem were made in 1845. From the Fenwick note, it is evident that [...] "the Rivulet" [...] was Easdale beck. But where was [...] "Emma's Dell"?

6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, 'the time, at least, {{of their}} {{fulfilment}} is far enough off. Union-workhouses and child-murder don't {{look much like}} it.

6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it rather disconnected, I fear, and there {{may prove to be}} little {{relation}} between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.|$|E
6000|$|... "One day Halkar <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> native village. We went to {{the house}} of a rich man. We found him at home, just {{returned}} from hunting. He was handsome, hospitable, and, it seemed to me, intelligent. But just before we left Halkar asked him a question about the great storm which laid waste the village and the whole countryside only a year before. He looked puzzled, answered us courteously, but vaguely. He remembered nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she replied. [...] "His name is Torrance. I {{have seen}} him {{a number of times}} in the past year. He worked as a clerk in a store, in the hosiery department, and waited on me there. Later I"--she hesitated--"I saw him in a place called Feinheimer's. He was a waiter.

"No. I {{remember}} when I {{was a very}} little girl that Uncle Thomas wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> doctor in Charlottetown and see if anything could be done for me, but mother would not let him.

2500|$|A man landed near my {{subterranean}} home. Behind {{him another}} man landed {{to his right}} [...] Then a third [...] landed nearby.

60|$|Showing no surprise, I {{answered}} that I would come, although goodness knows I was surprised enough, and leaving my servants {{to get my}} wagon out of the bog, I walked into the kraal with the messenger. He <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large hut placed within a fence about the gate of which some women were gathered, who all looked very anxious and disturbed. Among them I saw Dabuko the king's brother, whom I knew slightly. He greeted {{me and told me}} that Cetewayo was at the point of death within the hut, but like Umnikwa, professed ignorance of the cause of his illness.|$|E
6000|$|... "He did {{not allow}} me to finish my sentence, but putting his hand upon my shoulder, said gruffly: 'Come in. Don't you waste your breath talking about supper.' I entered, and the door was closed behind me. I {{followed}} this man through a stone passageway, and he <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> little stone room. ''Wait here!' he said, and he shut me in. I was in pitch-darkness, and {{had no idea what}} was going to happen next. After a little time I saw a streak of light coming through a keyhole; then an inner door opened, and a young woman with a lamp came into the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, to the banker's. He <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hotel, such a queer, quaint, delicious little place, with a {{court in}} the middle, and a gallery all round, and a lovely landlady, in such a beautifully fluted cap, and such a {{perfectly}} fitting dress! After a while we came out {{to walk to the}} banker's, for I haven't got any French money. But I was very dizzy from the motion of the vessel, and I thought I had better sit down. He found this place for me here, and he went off to the banker's himself. I am to wait here till he comes back." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{spoke of}} Progress spiring round, [...] Of Light and Mrs. Humphry Ward-- [...] It {{is not true}} to say I frowned, [...] Or ran about the room and roared; [...] I might have simply sat and snored-- [...] I rose politely in the club [...] And said, [...] "I feel a little bored; [...] Will someone <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pub?" ...|$|R
60|$|I let him <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{restaurant}} of his choice, {{but on the}} way I {{bought a}} paper.

5000|$|Gaines {{explained}} {{the start of}} his early academic childhood in an interview after college graduation. [...] "My father brought home a broken computer and I was able to put it together.
