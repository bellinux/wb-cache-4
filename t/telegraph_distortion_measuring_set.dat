All <b>distortion</b> <b>measures</b> and their modifications were tested on an alpha-digit vocabulary, 4 -talker, telephone recording data base. The results can be summarized as: (1) All LPC-based <b>distortion</b> <b>measures</b> performed reasonably well. The LLR and WSM <b>distortion</b> <b>measures</b> gave the highest recognition accuracy, while the IS <b>distortion</b> <b>measure</b> gave the lowest score; (2) Whereas the addition of suprasegmental energy information helped the recognition performance, the use of gain and absolute loudness degraded the performance; (3) Bark-scale frequency warping did not perform as well as its unwarped counterpart; (4) The WLR <b>distortion</b> <b>measure</b> did not perform as well as its unweighted counterpart. ...|$|R

Specifically, it considers entropyconstrained scalar quantization for memoryless Gaussian and Laplacian sources with both squared and absolute error <b>distortion</b> <b>measures.</b> The {{slope of the}} operational rate-distortion functions of scalar quantization for these sources and <b>distortion</b> <b>measures</b> is found.

For the case of a Gaussian source and absolute error <b>distortion</b> <b>measure,</b> however, the slope at rate equal zero of the operational-rate distortion function of scalar quantization is infinite, and hence does not match the slope of the corresponding Shannon rate-distortion function.

40|$|Abstract—As the {{diversity}} in end-user devices and networks grows, it becomes {{important to be}} able to efficiently and adaptively serve media content to different types of users. A key question surrounding adaptive media is how to do Rate-Distortion optimized scheduling. Typically, <b>distortion</b> is <b>measured</b> with a single <b>distortion</b> <b>measure,</b> such as the Mean-Squared Error compared to the original high resolution image or video sequence. Due to the growing diversity of users with varying capabilities such as different display sizes and resolutions, we introduce Multiple <b>Distortion</b> <b>Measures</b> to account for a diverse range of users and target devices. Multiple <b>Distortion</b> <b>Measures</b> (MDM) gives a clear framework with which to evaluate the performance of media systems which serve a variety of users. Scalable coders, such as JPEG 2000 and H. 264 /MPEG- 4 SVC, allow for adaptation to be performed with relatively low computational cost. We show that accounting for MDM can significantly improve system performance; furthermore, by combining this with scalable coding, this can be done efficiently. Given these Multiple <b>Distortion</b> <b>Measures,</b> we propose an algorithm to generate embedded schedules, which enables low-complexity, adaptive streaming of scalable media packets to minimize distortion across multiple users. We show that using MDM achieves up to 4 dB gains for spatial scalability applied to images and 12 dB gains for temporal scalability applied to video.
