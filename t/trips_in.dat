5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> one day, or many trips, or many short <b>trips,</b> <b>in</b> a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E

This is reflected in his fiction, where for example The Gift devotes two whole chapters (of five) to the tale of a father and son on a butterfly expedition.|$|E

An unsuccessful attack on German-occupied ports on the Arctic Ocean interrupted the ferry missions in mid-1941. Furious was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942. She made several more ferry <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> mid-1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in Vichy French Algeria {{as part of the}} opening stages of Operation Torch in November 1942.

5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's {{line for the}} next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off and isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces {{trying to reach the}} front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return <b>trips.</b> <b>In</b> general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas.|$|E

5|$|Sonically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiments with cultural elements like Middle Eastern music and Celtic origins. Lyrically, the album's central focus is about Minogue's self-discovery, which she found during a series of <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the freedom of expression, relationships and emotions.|$|E

When the completed O-Bahn was opened on 20 August 1989, passenger numbers rose another 17%. The Adelaide public transport system was privatised in the 1990s and overall patronage across all systems (bus, rail and tram) dropped 25%. The exception to this was the O-Bahn with no decrease, and there were 19,500 passenger trips daily in 1996 (7.13million a year). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.|$|E

This came about when Charlotte acquired a Triple-A expansion franchise in 1993, leaving the city's Double-A team without a home. Larry Schmittou offered Greer as a temporary home ballpark for the team. In order to accommodate an additional club at Greer, the Xpress scheduled its home games during the Sounds' road <b>trips.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, the Xpress relocated to Wilmington, North Carolina, and became the Port City Roosters.|$|E

These costs (along with {{costs associated with}} extending and operating the Blue Line to Van Dorn Street) forced WMATA to cut 335 jobs as well as supplies, travel, overtime, and temporary employee budgets. Although ridership was projected to rise 3.8 percent to 260 million <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> the coming year, the increased revenue was not expected {{to cover the costs}} of operating the new lines and stations.

The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998.

5|$|A report {{published}} by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the line had been exceeded. A {{survey conducted by the}} city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the Ring Line {{had a significant impact on}} the use of public transport in the area. Total public transport usage increased from 28 to 45%; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61%. At the Norwegian School of Management (BI), 85% of the students used public transport. The Ring Line reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10,000, and generated 11,000 more daily public transport <b>trips.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, daily passenger numbers at the stations were 8420 for Nydalen, 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen. The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved, and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi.|$|E

5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|By early April, Michigan {{was back}} in service; {{for the next several}} months, she {{primarily}} trained gunners in the Chesapeake Bay.

She was out of service {{for the rest of the}} war. In November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe. Michigan was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force in late December 1918 to ferry American soldiers back from Europe. She made two round <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> 1919 during the operation, the first from 18 January to 3 March, and the second from 18 March to 16 April. She brought back 1,062 men between the two voyages.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki {{a disaster}} zone. In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four <b>trips</b> <b>in</b> all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles were sent to the island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September24, they provided over 100,000litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050collapsible containers and 200hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|E
