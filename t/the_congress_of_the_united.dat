Camacho exercised the executive power till January 2, 1815.|$|E

25|$|The gold seekers {{organized}} the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States embroiled {{in the debate}} over slavery. The election of Abraham Lincoln for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the secession of nine southern slave states and the threat of civil war among the states. Seeking to augment the political power of the Union states, the Republican Party-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the Territory of Kansas into the Union as the free State of Kansas on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.|$|E
25|$|And so {{with the}} Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the vital matter of taxation. They are in a {{minority}} in Congress. Their representation in Congress, is useless to protect them against unjust taxation; and they are taxed {{by the people of}} the North for their benefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in the British parliament for their benefit. For the last forty years, the taxes laid by <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States have been laid with a view of subserving the interests of the North. The people of the South have been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object inconsistent with revenue to promote, by prohibitions, Northern interests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.|$|E

25|$|In the {{international}} arena, Western concern over communism waned with {{end of the}} Cold War, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The November 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre in Dili, East Timor, resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian Military. Suharto retaliated by cancelling purchase orders for American F-16 fighter jets in 1997. When Netherlands condemned the Santa Cruz Massacre, Suharto retaliated by expelling the Dutch from IGGI in March 1992 and renaming this aid organisation into Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) which continued increasing aid to Indonesia. Realizing this trend, Suharto sought wider alliances {{under the rubric of}} economic development, away from over-reliance to United States support. Suharto was elected as head of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1992, while Indonesia is a founding member of APEC in 1989 and host to the Bogor APEC Summit in 1994.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{believe that}} a state statute would be {{consistent}} with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E
