The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it.

Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this.

[...] Mitchell Broussard at We Got This Covered graded the season premiere 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "Fantastic" [...] and positively comparing it to Marvel's Ant-Man by saying [...] "Agent Carter finds a way to make the smaller stakes of Peggy's noir sandbox as tense, credible, and addictively watchable as any other addition to the MCU." [...] Broussard highlighted the performances of Atwell and D'Arcy as well as the new casting additions, and called the season's pacing, due to the small episode order, [...] "exciting". He noted that [...] "some may be disappointed in the more restrained adultness of the show releasing so soon after Jessica Jones, but I think that’s <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> about this world: each show feels different and its own thing, despite their close proximity." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry was less positive, praising the casting and performances but saying, [...] "Agent Carter feels too slavishly locked into the S.H.I.E.L.D. formula...it's sort of a shame Agent Carter isn’t more compelling, since the impeccable period trappings and costumes make the series a nice change of pace, at least visually." ...|$|E
