40|$|Abstract: When {{the design}} {{parameter}} of any equipment is fixed, it indicates the beginning stage of any equipment {{and at this}} stage; {{it is not possible}} to find out the exact requirement which the equipment has to fulfill. For utility equipments, it can not be anticipated what will be the actual operating requirements. The engineering concept during commissioning of the equipment is well guided by the experts and their guidance is limited for only a short period. With the passage of time and change in environment, the operating condition of the equipment changes. At this stage, the performance of the equipment/industries shows a downward trend. Sometimes, the system, situations and circumstances of working change. It affects the operating condition of Industries or Institutions even incurring huge losses. Every work is followed by certain technicality and if the technicality is deviated, the out come will affect performance. This is the main reason behind the continuous analysis and methodical approach to improve performance and to reach towards system perfection. <b>Technical</b> <b>Audit</b> is a ―tool ‖ to create awareness, develop skills, integrate knowledge, upgrade technicality, increase profitability, productivity: improve working conditions and quality of life. <b>Technical</b> <b>Audit</b> delights Owners of industries and also the Customers. <b>Technical</b> <b>Audit</b> is one of the most important Improvement Tool for big Industries and Multi National Companies. It is a well known fact that the improvement aspect always exists everywhere. Only there is the need to identify what should be that improvement.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed for finding the Quality and Profitability Improvement by <b>Technical</b> <b>Audit,</b> through {{a case study}} and further {{establishing}} {{the relationship between the}} product quality, profitability and <b>technical</b> <b>audit.</b> Quality audit generates the report of non conformance which basically represents the deviation from committed quality of products, or in short, it may be called as postmortem of product quality. By virtue of quality audit, the commitment, implementation and follow up for product quality are aligned. This delivers a good quality of product to the customers and thus the customer is benefited. In industries, Quality Inspectors are giving their decision for quality of product in two categories, "ACCEPTED" or "REJECTED". The accepted products are coming to the customers and the rejected products become the burden / problem to the manufacturers. If accepted product quantity is within the “NORMS”, no one cares regarding the rejected product quantities, what so ever. When the rejected product quantity increases beyond the “NORMS”, the analysis process starts to find out the reasons of rejections. Sometimes, it becomes too late to search out the reasons of rejections and survival of the industry becomes a problem. By <b>technical</b> <b>audit</b> and audit report implementation such type of conditions can be avoided and controlled. Basically, Quality is the function of Man, Machine, Materials, Methods, Movement, Manufacturing Processes, Monitoring and Management (8 M’s). If the technicality of 8 M’s is corrected by <b>Technical</b> <b>Audit,</b> the product quality will improve automatically and the profitability of the organization will improve. In short it can be solicited that if 8 M’s are all right, the product quality and profitability will automatically be set right. This may become an important aspect in the scenario of Indian Industries. The findings are supported by a case study of a Process Plant (Slag Dryer) of a reputed Indian Industry...|$|E
