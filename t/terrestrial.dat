5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence <b>terrestrial</b> planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the <b>terrestrial</b> planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of <b>terrestrial</b> planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because <b>terrestrial</b> planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the <b>terrestrial</b> planets.|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have <b>terrestrial</b> members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (<b>terrestrial</b> hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and <b>terrestrial</b> crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E

5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two <b>terrestrial</b> globes and four {{celestial}} globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 <b>terrestrial</b> globe, but it {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a <b>terrestrial</b> and a celestial globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a <b>terrestrial</b> globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Terrestrials: Planets {{that are}} similar to Earth, with bodies largely {{composed}} of rock: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the smallest <b>terrestrial</b> planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest <b>terrestrial</b> planet.|$|E
5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} <b>terrestrial.</b> The earliest confirmed <b>terrestrial</b> forms are {{known from the}} early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later. Still, they may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw {{their way through the}} mud.|$|E
5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky <b>terrestrials.</b> Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four <b>terrestrials,</b> Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|R

50|$|Most are epiphytes, {{but some}} are <b>terrestrials</b> with glossy, strap-like, plicate leaves, which are apical, oblong or elliptic-lanceolate, acute or acuminate. These orchids have a robust growth form. Their ovoid-conical pseudobulbs are deciduous.|$|R
5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a <b>terrestrial</b> or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more <b>terrestrial</b> of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use <b>terrestrial</b> livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the <b>terrestrial</b> biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
