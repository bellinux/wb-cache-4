Amplification of CDK 6 and deletion of CDK inhibitor 2 A/B (CDKN 2 A/B) genes are frequently found in GBM patients (~[*] 86 %), specifically in classical and mesenchymal subtypes [119]. Such alterations cause constitutive expression of E 2 F transcription factors leading to cell cycle acceleration, DNA replication and mitotic progress [119].

40|$|The {{expression}} of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> in fungi, which normally lack this enzyme, will greatly aid {{the study of}} DNA metabolism and provide useful drug-sensitive phenotypes. The herpes simplex virus type- 1 <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene (tk) was expressed in Neurospora crassa. tk was expressed as a fusion to N. crassa arg- 2 regulatory sequences and as a hygromycin phosphotransferase-thymidine kinase fusion gene {{under the control of}} cytomegalovirus and SV 40 sequences. Only strains containing tk showed <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> enzyme activity. In strains containing the arg- 2 - tk gene, both the level of enzyme activity and the level of mRNA were reduced by growth in arginine medium, consistent with control through arg- 2 regulatory sequences. Expression of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> in N. crassa facilitated radioactive labeling of replicating DNA following addition of [3 H]thymidine or [14 C]thymidine to the growth medium.

A DNA fragment carrying <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> coding sequences but lacking the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> promoter was sandwiched between a piece of adenoviral DNA and simian virus 40 early DNA on a plasmid.

At 8 h after infection, cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA hybridized to 14 % and 19 % of the recombinant DNA probe, respectively. However, no significant hybridization was found with either nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA extracted from cells infected and maintained in the presence of cycloheximide. This suggests that no thymidine kinase-related RNA was synthesized in the absence of alpha polypeptides, and supports the hypothesis that the alpha polypeptides effect new <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> RNA synthesis rather than being involved in processing or transport of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> RNA. In cells infected and maintained {{in the presence of the}} arginine analog canavanine, about 2 to 3 % of the plasmid DNA was found to hybridize with cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> is {{important}} for reactivation of virus from its latent state and is a target for the antiviral drug acyclovir. Most acyclovir-resistant isolates have mutations in the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene; however, how these mutations confer clinically relevant resistance is unclear. Reactivation from explanted mouse ganglia was previously observed with a patient-derived drug-resistant isolate carrying a single guanine insertion within a run of guanines in the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene. Despite this mutation, low levels of active enzyme were synthesized following an unusual ribosomal frameshift. Here we report that a virus, generated from a pretherapy isolate from the same patient, engineered to lack <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> activity, was competent for reactivation. This suggested that the clinical isolate contains alleles of other genes that permit reactivation {{in the absence of}} <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase.</b> Therefore, to establish whether <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> synthesized via a ribosomal frameshift was sufficient for reactivation under conditions where reactivation requires this enzyme, we introduced the mutation into the well-characterized strain KOS.

Plaque autoradiography revealed three phenotypes of reactivating viruses: uniformly low <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> activity, mixed high and low activity, and uniformly high activity. We generated a recombinant thymidine kinase-null virus from a reactivating virus expressing uniformly low activity.

Both activities were located in HindIII fragment J, which maps near the middle of VV DNA and contains about 2. 6 % of the genome (4, 800 base pairs). This DNA fragment encodes four known early polypeptides, and to determine which of these was <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase,</b> early VV mRNA was fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and used to direct cell-free synthesis of the active enzyme. The <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> mRNA cosedimented with several species that encoded polypeptides in the molecular weight range 15, 000 to 25, 000. Hybridization of these mRNAs to HindIII-J DNA selected a message that directed the synthesis of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> and a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 19, 000. The native molecular weight of VV <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> is about 80, 000, so these data indicate that, unlike <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> from several other sources, the active VV enzyme is probably a tetramer of 19, 000 -molecular-weight subunits...|$|R

Therefore, this substrate analog {{makes it possible to}} specifically stain infected cells.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTreatment of herpes infections with {{nucleoside}} analogues requires as {{an initial}} step the {{activation of the}} compounds by <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase.</b> As an aid to developing more effective chemotherapy, both for treatment of recurrent herpes infection and in gene therapy systems where <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> is expressed, two high-resolution X-ray structures of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> have been compared: one with the relatively poor substrate aciclovir (Zovirax), the other with a synthetic inhibitor having an N 2 -substituted guanine. Both compounds have similar binding modes {{in spite of their}} size difference and apparently distinct ligand properties...|$|R
