5|$|James Nesbitt and {{his agent}} {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, she offered him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around in public without attracting attention.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b> Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

50|$|Pascual-Leone {{proposed}} that the increase {{of the number of}} mental units that one can represent simultaneously makes the persons <b>able</b> <b>to</b> handle more complex concepts. For instance, one needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold two mental units in mind <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> decide if one number is bigger than another number. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> add them, the person needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold three units, that is, the two numbers plus the arithmetic operation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied, such as addition or subtraction. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand proportionality, one must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep in mind five units, that is the two pairs of numbers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared and their relation.|$|R

25|$|Spastic {{tetraplegia}} (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are {{the least}} likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs {{on one side of}} the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{impaired}} balance, patients {{suffering from}} ataxic cerebral palsy often walk {{with their feet}} unusually far apart (a wide gait). In addition, the low muscle tone caused by ataxic cerebral palsy causes people suffering from the disease to appear very unsteady, as their body is constantly trying to counterbalance itself. Infants with the disease often take a significantly longer amount of time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> without support, and over 50% of all children with ataxic cerebral palsy experience some form of a learning disability or speech impediment.|$|E

25|$|Number One (real name unknown) is {{the leader}} of the TNT. He is wheelchair-bound, has a long beard and a bald scalp. Running gag in the series is his age: he claims to be alive well even from the Neanderthal era and to meet various {{characters}} from history, such as Nero, Homer and Maximilien Robespierre. He has a habit of telling stories of his past to his agents, who all fall asleep in the end, causing him to angrily wake them up by brandishing his stick. Another running gag is his time spent in his wheelchair: in all of the stories, he is still paraplegic, never shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E

He was brought into the center's {{rehabilitation}} room, where it was discovered that he had pulmonary edema, which had nearly killed him; however, he was able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up and down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.|$|E

500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry.

He's not going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards.

500|$|Foot binding is {{the process}} in which the arch of a woman's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch. These [...] "fists of flesh" [...] were seen as {{attractive}} and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations. The process of foot binding was painful and often confined women to their rooms. Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> normally to accomplish house work. Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women. Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary for their own sake. The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese [...] "women". Naturally, the foot binding was recognized as [...] "national shame," [...] and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared, thus raging anti-footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s. Moreover, the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice. Thus, it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920. However, the practice was still popular within the interior areas of China till the 1930s and even in the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} Olympics, Patterson was {{diagnosed}} with several bulging discs in her lower back that had gone unnoticed.
