5|$|In 1897, Crowley {{travelled}} to St Petersburg in Russia, later claiming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> {{to learn}} Russian {{as he was}} considering a future diplomatic career there. Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating {{that he had been}} enlisted while at Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E

5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and {{barely able to}} sleep as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, trying to kill her. She returns {{to work at the}} police station; Sgt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) expresses concern about her emotional stability, but Debra is determined to resume a normal lifestyle. When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her on the shoulder and she instinctively punches him in the nose, certain <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to grab her.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the case, learning that Jason {{was taken into}} custody after the bus driver told police that he pushed Menand into the path of his vehicle. However, Jason tells authorities <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to save Menand. The security guard who arrested the old man is found frozen to death after exposure to a chemical refrigerant. Mulder interviews Jason, who explains Menand threatened to go public with a claim that Jason had falsified data on a research paper.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{included}} other literary sources {{within the}} poem: Stéphane Mallarmé, W. B. Yeats, Jonathan Swift, Arnaut Daniel, Nijinsky's dancing in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Religious images {{were used to}} connect the poem to the writings of Julian of Norwich, to {{the life and death}} of Thomas Wentworth, to William Laud, to Charles I, and to John Milton. Eliot relied on theological statements similar to those of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam and Thomas Hardy's The Impercipient. The Bible also played a large role within the poem, especially in discussions on the Holy Spirit and Pentecost. Many commentators have pointed out the influence of George Herbert within the poem, but Eliot, in a letter to Anne Ridler dated 10 March 1941, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to avoid such connections within Little Gidding.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka extermination camp to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to understand his character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to {{be all things to}} all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that {{one side or the other}} of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

She doesn't believe him, and thinks <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to drive a wedge into her and Peter's {{relationship}} out of jealousy. Isaac reasons <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> {{to protect her from}} Peter, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> too dangerous. Simone then attempts to give Isaac his key back, but again he refuses, and says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will do anything for her. Simone only wants for him to find Peter.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the main}} undercard matches on the card was between Rey Mysterio and Sabu for the World Heavyweight Championship. ECW {{representative}} Paul Heyman announced that Mysterio had accepted the challenge for One Night Stand on the June 2, 2006 edition of SmackDown. Before the June 9, 2006 edition of SmackDown, Heyman kayfabe revealed to WWE's official website <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to get Mysterio to join the new ECW brand. Mysterio turned down Heyman's offer on the June 9, 2006 edition of SmackDown. In the main event on that edition of SmackDown, Mysterio faced Finlay. Mysterio was about to 619 Finlay, when Sabu, who was holding a steel chair, climbed onto the ring apron. Mysterio dropkicked the chair into Sabu, which distracted the referee. This allowed Finlay to hit Mysterio with his shillelagh, and the Celtic Cross for the victory. After the contest, Sabu set up a table {{on the outside of}} the ring, and hit Mysterio with a springboard legdrop that sent Mysterio through the table.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{continues}} his ascent, murdering powerful foes {{that include the}} Titan Perses and the god Helios, which causes the sun to disappear, plunging the world into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. The Spartan chases the god, who leads him to the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and {{is key to the}} success of his quest, as it was in God of War. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos and is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She then leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the Omphalos Stone so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, the Spartan travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills the taunting goddess, ending all plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.|$|E
