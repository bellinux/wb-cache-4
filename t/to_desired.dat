25|$|Women and {{children}} experiencing domestic violence undergo occupational apartheid; they are typically denied access <b>to</b> <b>desired</b> occupations. Abusive partners may limit occupations {{and create an}} occupationally void environment which reinforces feelings of low self-worth and poor self-efficacy in ability to satisfactorily perform everyday tasks. In addition, work is impacted by functional losses, ability to maintain necessary employment skills, and ability to function within the work place. Oftentimes the victims are very isolated from other relationships as well such as having few to no friends, this is another method of control for the abuser.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the balance}} of power is largely {{reversed}} in baseball. While particularly skilled batters have some ability to place hit and direct the ball <b>to</b> <b>desired</b> locations, the pitcher's influence is much more dramatic. Pitchers induce more ground outs, fly outs, or strikeouts, depending on the style of pitch. Thus particular pitchers are known for causing batters to make certain kinds of outs, depending on their mastered pitches. Also in contrast to cricket, baseball batters must attempt to take first base on any ball put into fair territory, and failing to do so will result in an out, but the size of the strike zone more strictly limits the set of deliveries that must be swung at compared to cricket. Like cricket, baseball batters do have a defensive tactic available; many batters will often attempt to deliberately foul off pitches that are strikes yet difficult to hit well, by hitting them into foul territory, awaiting an easier delivery later in the at-bat. Since an uncaught foul ball cannot be a third strike (unless it was a bunt attempt), this tactic allows the batter to receive more pitches.|$|E

2500|$|Optimal {{control is}} a {{particular}} control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain [...] "cost index": for example, {{in the case of}} a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it <b>to</b> <b>desired</b> trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are Model Predictive Control (MPC) and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the [...] "optimal control" [...] structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in process control.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression of general smoking thoughts rather than thoughts specifically related <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. An experimental study {{examined the effects of}} suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke, versus expressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects of suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke on subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke were examined. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression of smoking thoughts may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke...|$|R
