25|$|The grape {{clusters}} of Mourvèdre are relatively compact, enhancing its susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>mildew,</b> with small thick-skinned berries that {{are high in}} both color and flavor phenolics, particularly tannins. Even though the variety ripens late, {{it has the potential}} to ripen to high Brix sugar levels which can translate into a high alcohol level during fermentation. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing abundant foliage that can shade the grape clusters, affecting canopy management decisions for growers. In Australia and California, many of the oldest plantings of Mourvèdre are bush trained as the vines grows well vertically but the variety can be grown under many different kinds of vine training systems.|$|E

Some were issued with the new 3B sets; however, following suggestions for improvements as the spotters developed their communications techniques, the Teleradio 3BZ was developed by AWA in 1942. Although it had many similarities to the 3B, its receiver had been partially modified and it had a transmitter which had been redesigned to include six crystal channels. It had also been [...] "tropicalised" [...] to protect it against the effects of the moist environment by reducing its susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>mildew,</b> rot and fungus.|$|E
2500|$|The berries are {{distinguished}} by their russet color when ripe [...] roux is French for the reddish-brown color russet, and {{is probably the}} root for the variety's name. The aroma of Roussanne is often reminiscent of a flowery herbal tea. [...] In warm climates, it produces wines of richness, with flavors of honey and pear, and full body. [...] In cooler climates it is more floral and more delicate, with higher acidity.

40|$|One {{of major}} {{concerns}} of modern agriculture is conservation, evaluation and utilization of genetic resources of agricultural plants. The {{aim of this}} research was to evaluate the resistance of leaves and berries of table grape varieties <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> (Erysiphe necator) under field conditions. During the period 1996 - 2004, 32 table varieties (viz. 28 interspecific varieties and 4 varieties of Vitis vinifera) were investigated. A high resistance of leaves and berries <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> has been proved for varieties Augustovskii, Yalovenskii Ustoichivyi, Pőlőskei Muskotály and Pleven Ustoichyvii.

2500|$|The {{harvested}} pods are opened, typically with a machete, {{to expose}} the beans. The pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded. The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps, placed in bins, or laid out on grates for several days. During this time, the seeds and pulp undergo [...] "sweating", where the thick pulp liquefies as it ferments. The fermented pulp trickles away, leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected. Sweating {{is important for the}} quality of the beans, which originally have a strong, bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may be ruined; if underdone, the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potatoes and becomes susceptible <b>to</b> <b>mildew.</b> Some cocoa-producing countries distill alcoholic spirits using the liquefied pulp.|$|E

6000|$|The {{varieties}} of the peach have largely increased in number since the Christian era, when {{from two to}} five varieties were known (10/56. Dr. A. Targioni-Tozzetti 'Journal Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page 167. Alph. de Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 885.) and the nectarine was unknown. At the present time, besides many varieties said to exist in China, Downing describes, in the United States, seventy-nine native and imported {{varieties of}} the peach; {{and a few years}} ago Lindley (10/57. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 page 554. See also Carriere 'Description et Class. des Varietes de Pechers.') enumerated one hundred and sixty-four varieties of the peach and nectarine grown in England. I have already indicated the chief points of difference between the several varieties. Nectarines, even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches, always possess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth and small. Clingstone and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ in the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother than in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not only in size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped, more imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the margin: whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is usually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The leaves are more or less serrated, and are either destitute of glands, or have globose or reniform glands (10/58. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 907.) and some few peaches, such as the Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped glands. (10/59. M. Carriere in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154.) According to Robertson (10/60. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 page 332. See also 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 271 to same effect. Also 'Journal of Horticulture' September 26, 1865 page 254.) the trees with glandular leaves are liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew; whilst the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, <b>to</b> <b>mildew,</b> and to the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,--the latter circumstance being especially attended to in the United States. Certain varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses better than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable of all the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer. (10/61. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 512.) Another Chinese variety, called the Honey-peach, is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point; its leaves are glandless and widely dentate. (10/62. 'Journal of Horticulture' September 8, 1853 page 188.) The Emperor of Russia peach is a third singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the fruit is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the other: it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar leaves.
