Although <b>the</b> current trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garlock Fault Zone is vertical, its earlier thrust history is preserved by: 1) foliation in the upper-plate diorite gneiss and the Pelona Schist parallel to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garlock Fault Zone, 2) <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> mylonite along portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garlock Fault Zone, 3) retrograde metamorphism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diorite gneiss near <b>the</b> <b>north</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garlock Fault Zone, 4) an increase in metamorphic grade in the Pelona Schist as <b>the</b> <b>north</b> branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garlock Fault Zone is approached.

5|$|Convection {{began to}} {{increase}} on July 6, {{supported on the}} basis that many showers were observed to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depression. An anticyclone—a large mass of air rotating clockwise—intensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center of the depression. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7, and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg). Cindy began to curve westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and drifted due west early on July 8 {{as a result of a}} maturing surface high to its north. Steady intensification continued throughout the day, and the storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.|$|E

5|$|In 1654, when Michael Roberts was principal, {{the college}} {{accounts}} record payment {{for construction of}} a ball court.

Ball courts, bowling greens and groves were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors, rather than indulge in forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses. In 1757, principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach-house built there, which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along a driveway across <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden.|$|E
