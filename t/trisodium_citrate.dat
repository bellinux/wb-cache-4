5000|$|An early, {{and very}} common, method for synthesizing silver {{nanoparticles}} is citrate reduction. This method was first recorded by M. C. Lea, who successfully produced a citrate-stabilized silver colloid in 1889. [...] Citrate reduction involves {{the reduction of}} a silver source particle, usually AgNO3 or AgClO4, to colloidal silver using <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate,</b> Na3C6H5O7. The synthesis is usually performed at an elevated temperature (~100 °C) to maximize the monodispersity (uniformity in both size and shape) of the particle. In this method, the citrate ion traditionally acts as both the reducing agent and the capping ligand, making it a useful process for AgNP production due to its relative ease and short reaction time. However, the silver particles formed may exhibit broad size distributions and form several different particle geometries simultaneously. [...] The addition of stronger reducing agents to the reaction {{is often used to}} synthesize particles of a more uniform size and shape.|$|E

50|$|An economical, {{environmentally}} {{benign and}} fast synthesis methodology for gold nanoparticles using block copolymer {{has been developed}} by Sakai et al. In this synthesis methodology, block copolymer plays the dual role of a reducing agent {{as well as a}} stabilizing agent. The formation of gold nanoparticles comprises three main steps: reduction of gold salt ion by block copolymers in the solution and formation of gold clusters, adsorption of block copolymers on gold clusters and further reduction of gold salt ions on the surfaces of these gold clusters for the growth of gold particles in steps, and finally its stabilization by block copolymers. But this method usually has a limited-yield (nanoparticle concentration), which does not increase with the increase in the gold salt concentration. Recently, Ray et al. demonstrated that the presence of an additional reductant (<b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate)</b> in 1:1 mole ratio with gold salt enhances the yield by manyfold at ambient conditions and room temperature.|$|E

BackgroundRegional anticoagulation with <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{is an effective}} form of anticoagulation {{for continuous}} renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for patients with contraindications to heparin. However, because of the metabolic complications of <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate,</b> it is a complicated technique requiring specialized dialysis solutions. We have designed a simplified protocol for citrate regional anticoagulation for CRRT. MethodsTwo percent <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate</b> was delivered at 250 mL/h via the prefilter port of a COBE PRISMA device, with the rate adjusted to maintain a postfilter ionized calcium (iCa++) < 0. 5 mmol/L. A central calcium gluconate infusion was used to maintain a systemic iCa++ at 1. 1 mmol/L. A standard dialysate solution consisting of 0. 9 % saline, KCl 3 mmol/L, and MgSO 4 1 mmol/L was delivered at 1000 mL/h. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes and complications associated with this protoco 1 in 29 patients treated from July 1999 to October 1999, evaluating the frequency of clotting of the dialyzer, bleeding complications, citrate toxicity, and patient mortality. ResultsThe Kaplan–Meier curve for dialyzer survival demonstrated a 61 % survival rate at 48 hours. There were no episodes of significant bleeding or citrate toxicity. Seventy-two percent of patients died for reasons unrelated to CRRT.

40|$|Bacteriocins {{are natural}} {{antibacterial}} peptides ribosomally biosynthesized by bacteria. Gassericin T {{which is a}} bacteriocin produced by many strains of Lactobacillus gasseri has a broad antibacterial spectrum against food spoilage and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria; therefore, the bacteriocin and its producers are predicted for use as safe food preservatives. However, probiotic Lb. gasseri strains show poor growth and minimally produce gassericin T in food-grade natural media such as reconstituted cheese whey, unlike in MRS broth. The growth of Lb. gasseri in reconstituted cheese whey was improved by adding proteose peptone as a nutrient factor. The production of gassericin T in MRS broth was specifically inhibited by adding divalent metal cations, and then the inhibition was removed using a chelator of divalent cations, <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate</b> dihydrate. The production of gassericin T in reconstituted cheese whey was also restored by adding <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate</b> dihydrate, and the activity was enhanced by a surfactant, Tween 80. In addition, <b>trisodium</b> <b>citrate</b> dihydrate led to over-production of and synergistic antibacterial effect with gassericin T.
