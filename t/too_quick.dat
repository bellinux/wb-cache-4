5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is <b>too</b> <b>quick,</b> contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
25|$|A rubber {{match with}} Bonjasky {{occurred}} in 2007, {{but by now}} it was clear Leko was passing his physical prime, and he lost in round 1, after Bonjasky landed his trademark flying knee. Golden Glory claimed the stoppage was <b>too</b> <b>quick,</b> but nevertheless, Leko was out of another World Grand Prix - his last appearance in the Final 16.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} found that lying takes longer than telling the truth, and thus the time to answer a {{question}} may be used as a method of lie detection. However, it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a prepared lie. The only compromise is to try to surprise the victim and find a midway answer, not <b>too</b> <b>quick,</b> nor too long.|$|E

25|$|Barclay, the Russian commander-in-chief, {{refused to}} fight despite Bagration's urgings. Several times he {{attempted}} to establish a strong defensive position, but each time the French advance was <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> for him to finish preparations and {{he was forced to}} retreat once more. When the French army progressed further, serious problems in foraging surfaced, aggravated by scorched earth tactics of the Russian army advocated by Karl Ludwig von Phull.|$|E
25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but {{he somehow}} managed to keep the first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but {{he got back to}} his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, but it was <b>too</b> <b>quick.</b> The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E
25|$|Some of the Frenchmen {{living in}} the {{outbuildings}} set up a shout on seeing two of their number killed, at which a man within the fort opened the wicket of the main entrance to admit the fugitives. The camp master closed with him and killed him, and the Spaniards poured into the enclosure. Laudonnière's trumpeter had just mounted the rampart, and seeing the Spaniards coming towards him sounded the alarm. The French—most of whom were still asleep in their beds—taken entirely by surprise, came running out of their quarters into the driving rain, some half-dressed, and others quite naked. Among the first was Laudonnière, who rushed out of his quarters in his shirt, his sword and shield in his hands, and began to call his soldiers together. But the enemy had been <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> for them, and the wet and muddy courtyard was soon covered {{with the blood of}} the French cut down by the Spanish soldiers, who now filled it. At Laudonnière's call, some of his men had hastened to the breach on the south side, where lay the ammunition and the artillery. But they were met by a party of Spaniards who repulsed and killed them, and who finally raised their standards in triumph upon the walls. Another party of Spaniards entered by a similar breach on the west, overwhelming the soldiers who attempted to resist them there, and also planted their ensigns on the rampart.|$|E

500|$|Experience {{demonstrated}} that the final approach to the target required fast action, <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> for the radar operator to easily communicate corrections to the pilot. In 1940, Hanbury Brown wrote a paper On Obtaining Visuals from AI Contacts which demonstrated mathematically that the time delays inherent to the interception system were seriously upsetting the approach. In the short term he suggested the fighters make their approach to dead astern while still [...] out, and then fly straight in. For the longer term, he suggested adding a pilot's indicator that directly demonstrated the direction needed to intercept.|$|E
500|$|He has {{repeatedly}} criticized [...] "science by consensus," [...] {{arguing that the}} scientific community is <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> to reject certain kinds of ideas. [...] "Anything goes among the physics community – cosmic wormholes, time travel," [...] he argues, [...] "just {{so long as it}} keeps its distance from anything mystical or New Age-ish." [...] Referring to this position as [...] "pathological disbelief," [...] he holds it responsible for the rejection by academic journals of papers on the paranormal. He has compared parapsychology to the theory of continental drift, proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener (1880–1930) to explain observations that were otherwise inexplicable, which was resisted and ridiculed until evidence led to its acceptance after Wegener's death.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi {{believed}} there were material contradictions between Hinduism and Islam, and he shared {{his thoughts on}} Quran and on Muslims many times. He stated in 1925, for example, {{that he has not}} criticised the teachings of the Quran, but he does criticise the interpreters of Quran. Gandhi believed that numerous interpreters have interpreted it to fit their preconceived notions. He believed Muslims should welcome criticism of Quran, because [...] "every true scripture only gains from criticism". Gandhi criticised Muslims who [...] "betray intolerance of criticism by a non-Muslim of anything related to Islam", such as the penalty of stoning to death under Islamic law. To Gandhi, Islam has [...] "nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable". According to him, Islam like communism was <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> in resorting to violence.|$|E

500|$|Bob Kapur {{also of the}} Canadian Online Explorer {{reviewed}} Victory Road. In his review, he {{gave the}} third round of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament a 9 out of 10, while the final round received an 8 out of 10. Kapur gave several comments regarding the third round bout: [...] "This was a throwback to some of the jaw-droppingly amazing X-Division matches that TNA used to deliver consistently back during their weekly PPV days. For the most part, the action was <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> and too plentiful to describe in words...Incredible match that went for about 30 minutes and seriously should be seen – get the replay or the DVD." [...] As for the final round, Kapur said it was [...] "like the first match" [...] in that it [...] "was excellent with some tremendous crazy spots." ...|$|E
500|$|The story, for Mellor, was strong; [...] "the shocks {{have the}} {{intended}} impact {{and the whole}} half-hour works a treat". She commended the [...] "good writing [...] excellent structure". Hogan considered the episode [...] "ingeniously plotted", and Owen called it [...] "delightfully written". [...] The timing was also praised. Critics were less convinced by the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode; though Butler called it [...] "satisfying and surprising", it was criticised as lacking in meaning, and as [...] "prosaically disappointing". For Billen, the reveal made the episode's premise [...] "less interesting", and, for Owen, the characters were <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> to admit defeat. The final scene, in particular, was criticised, with some commentators suggesting that, if thought about too much, it was not fully convincing; it was described as [...] "arguably unnecessary" [...] and as offering the episode's only [...] "punch [...] to connect".|$|E
500|$|The New York Dolls and Morton {{produced}} little original material {{together and}} had to record cover songs and re-recorded some of the band's earlier demos to complete Too Much Too Soon; [...] "Babylon", [...] "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", [...] "It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Human Being" [...] had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, [...] "Teenage News" [...] and [...] "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither were considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling {{he had been in}} a rush: [...] "He was <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Trenchant early {{criticism}} of Freud's monism {{was made by}} Karen Horney, who suggested that the psychoanalytic view had itself become fixated {{at the level of}} the small boy aggrandising himself at his sister's expense.

500|$|On 12 August, the Football Association {{announced}} that Pogba would be suspended for Manchester United's opening Premier League fixture of the 2016–17 season against Bournemouth, due to two yellow cards he had accumulated {{in the previous}} season's edition of the Coppa Italia with Juventus. On 19 August, {{he made his first}} appearance since returning to the club in a 2–0 home victory over Southampton in the Premier League. After the 2–1 defeat at home in the first Manchester Derby of the season on 10 September, Pogba was criticized for his lack of discipline in positioning by pundit Jamie Carragher. Pogba, however, soon recovered to form and scored his first Premier League goal for United with a header against defending champions Leicester City in a 4–1 home win on 24 September. He then scored twice, once from the penalty spot and then with a strike from distance, in a Europa League tie against Fenerbahçe on 20 October. Manager José Mourinho defended Pogba after the game, criticizing football's [...] "Einsteins" [...] for being <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> to judge the player.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour could turn into a [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> to say who he respected, and who he disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, {{release date}} for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising {{his role as the}} title hero. It was also {{reported}} that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity. The Los Angeles Times cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects-heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh's departure, although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel. Branagh noted, [...] "It was a long time [...] and they were way <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> for me to get straight back into another, [...] it was a pleasurable experience and a film I'm very proud of." [...] The following day, Marvel formally hired Payne, one of the credited writers of the first film, to script the sequel. In August, Brian Kirk entered early negotiations to direct the Thor sequel. The film would have marked Kirk's first time directing a big-budget motion picture, after having directed television series for HBO, Showtime and the BBC, including Game of Thrones.|$|E

500|$|Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club {{thought the}} episode was less {{successful}} at satirizing Facebook {{compared to the}} episode [...] "Holidays of Future Passed". He explained that there is [...] "a moment in 'Holidays' when Lisa steps into the future version of the Internet and is immediately besieged by a mountain of friend requests. That was a small yet sharp parody of Facebook’s ubiquity, but [...] lays into the same topic with a less deft touch." [...] Childs added that the episode [...] "has a few good jokes to keep the proceedings moving along, {{but not enough to}} rescue [...] from mediocrity." [...] He concluded that he thought the story ended too fast with Lisa shutting down her website and the citizens of Springfield returning to their everyday technology-lacking life: [...] "That’s a bit <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> a turn, [...] slapping a moralistic tone onto all of the preceding satire." [...] David Crawford of Radio Times commented that [...] "The D'oh-cial Network" [...] features [...] "a rather thin attempt to parody The Social Network". Yahoo! TV's Brian Davis criticized the episode for being too [...] "straightforward in terms of the satire" [...] as it was [...] "generally obvious [...] what each reference and joke was referring to." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckett {{impressed}} the Marlins {{in his first}} spring training with the team in March 2000, with a fastball clocked at [...] and a good curveball. [...] He also showed {{his commitment to the}} team by donating $100,000 to the team's charitable foundation, more than any other player had donated. He was assigned to the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League to make his professional debut. As the Opening Day starter for the Cougars, he pitched four innings and allowed only one run, on a double by Albert Pujols. Beckett suffered from injuries that season, including shoulder tendinitis and a frayed rotator cuff, injuries which took longer to heal because he did too much weight lifting while on the disabled list. He would later say, [...] "I tried to get too strong <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> and ended up making things worse." [...] He pitched in 13 games for the Cougars and finished with a record of 2–3 with a 2.12 ERA and 61 strikeouts. He was selected by Baseball America as the Marlins best prospect and the 19th best in the entire minor leagues as well as having the best fastball in the Midwest League. He was also selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game, a showcase for the best prospects.|$|E
500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm curious to see if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers {{some of the problems that}} have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> to take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem at times like this is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{the film}} was released, the staff at Variety {{magazine}} praised the film, writing, [...] "Beginning is a bit <b>too</b> cryptic for <b>quick</b> understanding, but when plotline by Cyril Hume from a suggested story by Lawrence Taylor does take shape, the story builds and holds attention. Joseph H. Lewis' direction spins it along expertly, neatly pacing the suspenseful sequences." ...|$|R
