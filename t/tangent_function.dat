25|$|The {{first of}} these results is {{apparent}} by considering, for instance, the <b>tangent</b> <b>function,</b> which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−π/2, π/2) andR (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel). The second result was proved by Cantor in1878, but only became intuitively apparent in1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space.

25|$|As {{the angle}} of bank θ {{approaches}} 90°, the <b>tangent</b> <b>function</b> approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/r. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for θ), and for sharper turns (smaller r) the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle θ does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the coefficient of friction is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} constructing a structured quadrilateral grid inside a given four-sided 2 D region by a particular boundary-conforming mapping scheme – Hermite Interpolation Mapping (HIM). When the four given boundary curves are concave and convoluted, all boundary-conform mapping methods suffer from potential self-overlapping problem. Under HIM, the geometry of the grid depends on both the four boundary curves and the <b>tangent</b> vector <b>functions</b> associated with the curves. While the four boundary curves are fixed, the <b>tangent</b> <b>functions</b> in HIM can be varied to suit the need of controlling {{the characteristics of the}} mesh inside the given region so to prevent self-overlapping. Besides <b>tangent</b> <b>functions,</b> the four twist vectors at the corners of the region can also be adjusted to influence the distribution of the inner grid elements. In our approach, a constrained functional optimization scheme is adopted to adjust the <b>tangent</b> <b>functions</b> and the twist vectors, adaptive to the geometry of the boundary curves, so that the resulting HIM will be free of self-overlapping. The optimization is carried out on the shape control energy that measures the overall mesh quality of the underlying HIM while the self-overlapping is strongly prevented in the form of constraints to the optimization. Experimental results show the promise of the proposed method as a practical and effective solution for structured grid generation...|$|R

2500|$|The most {{familiar}} trigonometric functions are the sine, cosine, and tangent. In {{the context of}} the standard unit circle (a circle with radius 1 unit), where a triangle is formed by a ray starting at the origin and making some angle with the -axis, the sine of the angle gives the length of the -component (the opposite to the angle or the rise) of the triangle, the cosine gives the length of the -component (the adjacent of the angle or the run), and the <b>tangent</b> <b>function</b> gives the slope (-component divided by the -component). More precise definitions are detailed below. [...] Trigonometric functions are commonly defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle, and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a unit circle.
