5|$|Gatlif {{wanted to}} {{represent}} the entire Romani community through <b>the</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity. For example, Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts, which echoes the Romani phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills, which {{was very hard to}} find. In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville, he was impressed James Thiérrée, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was Romani) Thiérrée learned Romanes and Romani swing music in six months.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on <b>the</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on <b>the</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study}} of culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> Neville Sinclair was {{inspired}} by movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Upon its October 1974 release, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was banned}} {{outright}} in several countries, and numerous theaters later stopped showing {{the film in}} response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was enormously profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office. It has since received a positive reappraisal and gained {{a reputation as one}} of the best and most influential horror films in cinema history. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons and <b>the</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure. The popularity of the film led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, remakes, one prequel, comic books and video games.|$|E
