25|$|In 1931, the {{dictator}} general Jorge Ubico came to power, {{backed by the}} United States, and initiated {{one of the most}} brutally repressive governments in Central American history. Just as Estrada Cabrera had done during his government, Ubico created a widespread network of spies and informants and had large numbers of political opponents tortured and put to death. A wealthy aristocrat (with an estimated income of $215,000 per year in 1930s dollars) and a staunch anti-communist, he consistently sided with the United Fruit Company, Guatemalan landowners and urban elites in disputes with peasants. After the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, the peasant system established by Barrios in 1875 to jumpstart coffee production in the country was not good enough anymore, and Ubico was forced to implement a system of debt slavery and forced labor <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was enough labor available for the coffee plantations and that the UFCO workers were readily available.|$|E
25|$|Constantius died in 421, {{after only}} seven months as Augustus. He had been careful <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no {{successor}} in waiting, {{and his own}} children were far too young to take his place. Honorius was unable to control his own court {{and the death of}} Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, {{at the head of a}} substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of magister militum.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the king}} had {{declared}} the German commission unlawful, {{it became clear that}} he would never be won over. An impatient Hitler appointed a German, Josef Terboven, as the new Norwegian Reichskommissar, or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be no room in the government for the Nasjonal Samling nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along. Terboven eventually accepted a certain Nasjonal Samling presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the Nasjonal Samling and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany. Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral Erich Raeder, whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned [...] "in triumph," [...] having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August. The Reichskommissar would now have to accommodate Quisling as leader of the government, then allow him to rebuild the Nasjonal Samling and bring more of his men into the cabinet. Terboven complied and addressed the Norwegian people in a radio broadcast in which he asserted that the Nasjonal Samling would be the only political party allowed.|$|E

2500|$|State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said, [...] "We're {{disappointed}} in the verdict today because we know the facts and we've put in absolutely every {{piece of evidence that}} existed. This is a dry-bones case. Very, very difficult to prove. The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage." [...] Jose Baez said, [...] "While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been {{for the last three years}} has been always <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple." [...] He added, [...] "And today our system of justice has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction." [...] Former Casey Anthony defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden shared Baez's sentiments. She believes the jury reached the right verdict. [...] "We should embrace their verdict," [...] she stated.|$|E
2500|$|Tiernan {{alleged that}} {{on the morning of}} 17 May 1974, Hanna and Jackson transported the bombs across the border into the Republic of Ireland in the latter's poultry lorry having {{retrieved}} them from James Mitchell's farm in Glenanne where they had been constructed and stored. After meeting up {{with the rest of the}} UVF bombing team at the Coachman's Inn pub carpark on the northern outskirts of Dublin, Hanna activated the bombs and then, along with Jackson, placed them into the three allocated cars' boots. The cars had been hijacked and stolen earlier that morning in Belfast by a local UVF gang known as [...] "Freddie and the Dreamers" [...] which was allegedly led by William [...] "Frenchie" [...] Marchant. They were subsequently driven south and delivered to the bombing team at the carpark. Tiernan suggested that Hanna had been paranoid that the Garda√≠ would stop the cars at a checkpoint. He therefore ordered the drivers to travel to Dublin by separate routes, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no police presence on the roads.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginnings}} of {{his work on the}} Mackinac Bridge, Stewart Woodfill was impressed with Steinman's ethical procedure in addressing his requests. In 1950 new legislation was produced stating [...] "the board of engineers retained by the Mackinac Bridge Authority was to be selected and nominated by the Dean of Engineering at the University of Michigan" [...] (Ratigan 280). This was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no political influence it this decision. Steinman was selected {{to be a member of}} the board. Steinman who had been trained since he was young to work well in groups was chosen as the spokesman for the board. When it comes to speaking in front of large audiences Steinman does it naturally. It was said that Steinman spoke [...] "as comfortable before large audiences as he was on tall bridges" [...] (Petroski 332). The stresses of the early stages of the bridge soon took their toll on Steinman. He had heart attacks in 1952, which was the same year that legislation approved the financing and construction of the bridge.|$|E

2500|$|Durdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he {{witnessed}} {{the crime and}} knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with [...] "A Man Could Go Quite Mad", to admit his or her culpability; the gist {{of each of these}} songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill Jasper, not Drood, for his or her own purpose- Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood {{for a while and then}} given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper votes, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a twist).|$|E
