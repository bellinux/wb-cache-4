40|$|Objective. {{the aim of}} {{this study}} is to report the use of a female condom as a non-surgical silon pouch in the early {{management}} of newborns with gastroschisis with large visceroabdominal disproportion. Methods. Pre-washed, sterile female condoms without spermicide were used as an early approach to treat gastroschisis in 20 newborns with large defects and in whom staged correction was anticipated. the condom was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit using sterile technique, with no anesthesia, and it was removed only at the time of the surgical procedure for gastroschisis correction. Results. There were no complications associated with the use of a female condom as a <b>temporary</b> <b>silo</b> for gastroschisis. It protected the exposed organs and also allowed a careful evaluation of the bowel and a better pre-operative planning without the need for emergency procedures. Conclusion. the use of a female condom as a silon pouch is a low-cost and simple alternative in the initial management of newborns with gastroschisis in whom primary correction is considered non-feasible.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} an integrated control approach for discrete event systems in industry. The integrated control involves two levels: basic control functions (PLC level) and higher supervision (SCADA Level). The considered discrete event system {{consists of three}} main groups: a chain of conveyors and a moving carriage to charge the tobacco material into silos (charging group), set of <b>silos</b> for <b>temporary</b> storage (<b>silos</b> group), and a chain of conveyors to discharge the material (discharging group). The system is analyzed using a sequential function chart (Grafcet tool) and discrete models are developed for both PLC level and SCADA level. Based on the developed model, a new control panel is designed using a PLC. The developed system is equipped by an industrial PC to visualize the industrial operation {{and to make the}} operator interact easily with the controlled system. The new system has the advantages of: high reliability in function operation, minimal downtime, and fault diagnosis capability in system components. The system is tested in applying standard commissioning procedures to ensure the quality and safety operation for the developed control panel. This application is running successfully and the required control objectives are maintained *. I...|$|R
40|$|When {{faculty members}} turn in their annual reports, they {{frequently}} include such public service contributions as fund-raising, staffing a food bank, participating in Habitat for Humanity, and service on nonprofit boards or clinics. They {{usually do not}} list Internet-based "virtual public service " (VPS) in their reports, perhaps because this activity is not yet fully defined or formally recognized as public service. However, many academic computing environments possess the resources to house VPS efforts. Most universities operate a large public Web site, and many universities also offer Web-based course management systems such as Blackboard or WebCT as instructional supports. In contrast to other public sites, such systems tend to be restricted to internal audiences and typically exist to support college courses, thereby functioning as <b>siloed,</b> <b>temporary</b> repositories of knowledge (Cohn 2004; Cohn and Hibbitts 2004). Universities also host {{both public and private}} journal Web sites, center Web sites, and even academic blogs. Some faculty, however, have flipped the telescope around and have started to use the Internet as a bridge to the public instead of merely to each other. Leveraging their specialist knowledge and their academic authority against perceived public needs, they have created another type of academic Web site on their institutional serversâ€”the academic public service Web site (APSWS). We define the APSWS as an open-access Web-based resource that provides information about an academic discipline and serves the public good. Thi...|$|R
