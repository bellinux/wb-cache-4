5|$|Anime cutscenes are {{included}} in each game, and are a primary focus for the production team as they help make <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was Destiny. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until Xillia. For Xillia, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic direction for the series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of Hearts, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the production team, with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style.|$|E
5|$|On the east, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> {{is all of}} rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, {{cutting off}} a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie {{contains}} Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

25|$|The Duplex or Reversible machine derives {{its name}} {{from the fact that it}} prints both sides of the cloth.

A pin pushed through the face of the cloth ought to protrude through the corresponding part of the design printed on the back if the two patterns are in good fit.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623. The printer originally {{expected to have}} the book ready early, since it was listed in the Frankfurt Book Fair catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account book entry for 5 December 1623 of Edward Dering (who purchased two); the Bodleian Library, in Oxford, received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for £24 as a superseded edition when the Third Folio became available in 1663/1664).|$|E
25|$|It takes just {{one-tenth of}} a second for us to judge someone and make a first impression. Research finds that the more time {{participants}} are afforded to form the impression, the more confidence in impressions they report. Not only are people quick to form first impressions, they are also fairly accurate when the target presents him or herself genuinely. People are generally not good at perceiving feigned emotions or detecting lies. Research participants who reported forming accurate impressions of specific targets did {{tend to have more}} accurate perceptions of specific targets that aligned with others' reports of the target. Individuals are also fairly reliable at understanding <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> that he/she will project to others.|$|E

Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd) agreed to print the books using Wainwright's original manuscript, although in fact the printing was done by The Westmorland Gazette in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd.

To the north-east of Dollywaggon Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove, a corrie surrounded on three sides by crag. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrious activity, with the remains of several levels and some shallow open mineworking being visible near the Lodge. These excavations were made for lead-bearing galena, and {{are believed to have}} been worked in the sixteenth century. Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862, the last-known operation being in 1880. To the east of Dollywaggon Pike is a second corrie, Cock Cove, with Falcon Crag and the deeply gullied Tarn Crag providing the impressive headwall.|$|E

Writing in the Royal Institute of British Architects Journal in 2002, Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court, Maguire & Co., for their [...] "crispness of detail" [...] and [...] "richness of composition"; he said that [...] "the sense of ordered space... recalls {{the way in which the}} traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then-new idea of a university". He noted that, whilst <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> of the houses was Elizabethan with the air of a courtyard garden, [...] "closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility"; there was, he wrote, [...] "the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use". However, he commented that whilst there was plenty of space inside, the furniture [...] "would not look out of place in a motorway hotel".|$|E

2500|$|In {{commercial}} impression-die forging, {{the workpiece}} is usually moved {{through a series}} of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities; this impression is called an [...] "edging", [...] "fullering", or [...] "bending" [...] impression. The following cavities are called [...] "blocking" [...] cavities, in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product. These stages usually impart the workpiece with generous bends and large fillets. The final shape is forged in a [...] "final" [...] or [...] "finisher" [...] impression cavity. If there is only a short run of parts to be done, then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features.|$|E
