Shaw gave birth early to daughter, Madilyn Grace Smith, on November 12, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia. Announcing the birth, Ne-Yo said of his first child, [...] "I've been in love before but <b>this</b> <b>feels</b> like nothing I've ever felt... like I'm in love for the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2016, {{the first}} teaser trailer {{for the film}} debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} the [...] "series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes" [...] featured in the trailer to the film Inception, as did Scott Mendelson of Forbes. Forbes added that {{the structure of the}} trailer resembled early marketing for the film Batman Begins. The Hollywood Reporters Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to The Matrix and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of Hugh Laurie's Gregory House from House, calling them not [...] "necessarily a real problem, of course... there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: {{due to the nature of}} the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material." [...] McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of [...] "Tilda Swinton literally knock Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body," [...] but concluded, [...] "as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, <b>this</b> <b>feels</b> far less bold and assured" [...] than the first trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2017, Dylan {{released}} his triple album, Triplicate, comprising 30 new recordings of classic American songs, including [...] "As Time Goes By" [...] by Herman Hupfeld and [...] "Stormy Weather" [...] by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. Dylan's 38th studio album {{was recorded in}} Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band. Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. [...] "Nostalgic? No I wouldn’t say that. It’s not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for {{the good old days}} or fond memories of what’s no more. A song like [...] "Sentimental Journey" [...] is not a way back when song, it doesn’t emulate the past, it’s attainable and down to earth, it’s in the here and now." [...] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: [...] "For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, <b>this</b> <b>feels</b> like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter." ...|$|E

500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because <b>this</b> <b>feels</b> like something [...] special.' We started talking about that and going back and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] <b>This</b> <b>feels</b> right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

Lo! he holds high in heaven the fatal beam; A golden pan depends from each, extreme; <b>This</b> <b>feels</b> of Porter's fate the downward stress, That bears {{the destiny of}} all Van Ness. Alas! the rusted scales, their life all gone, Deliver judgment neither pro nor con: The dooms hang level and the war goes on. With a divine, contemptuous disesteem Jove dropped the pans and kicked, himself, the beam: Then, to decide the strife, with ready wit, The nickel {{that he did not}} care for it Twirled absently, remarking: [...] "See it spin: Head, Porter loses; tail, the others win." [...] The conscious nickel, charged with doom, spun round, Portentously and made a ringing sound, Then, staggering beneath its load of fate, Sank rattling, died at last and lay in state.|$|E
60|$|After {{about two}} miles’ ride we {{turned the corner}} of a slight rise, and there before us lay the camp. It is prettily {{situated}} {{on the side of a}} little valley, and faces the north. The 10th Native Infantry are encamped on the right wing; the Mountain Train occupy the centre; and the 3d Cavalry camp lies on the left. Behind the rise a plain stretches away, and upon this the troops will be encamped as they arrive. The soil of the valley-side and of the plain beyond is a mere sand, covered with grass and bushes, but in the hollow of the valley, where the stream runs, or rather used to run, it is a deep black peat. Wells are now being sunk in this peat, and these rapidly fill with water. There are still deep pools where the stream formerly ran, and dams have been formed, which will keep back a considerable supply of water. The troops are not, therefore, likely to fall short for some time, and if they should, there is plenty at a stream two or three miles farther on. The health of the troops is pretty good, but both officers and men are subject to slight attacks of fever, much more so than they were when encamped on the plain by the sea. This is singular, for except that the nights are rather cold, <b>this</b> <b>feels</b> the very perfection of climate. The horses and mules are doing much better up here, and although some died at first, it is probable that they had brought the seeds of the disease with them from the pass below. As it is, the cavalry have suffered terribly. The 5th Cavalry, out of five hundred horses, have lost one hundred and seventy, and the officers’ horses of the infantry and Mountain Train have been nearly exterminated.|$|E

50|$|Self-conscious {{emotions}} {{are seen to}} promote social harmony in different ways. The first {{is its ability to}} reinforce social norms. It does this in a very similar way to that of operant conditioning. Performing well in situations while keeping to social norms can elicit pride. <b>This</b> <b>feels</b> good so therefore encourages the behaviour to be repeated. Equally performing in a situation while not sticking to the social norms can leave individuals feeling embarrassed. <b>This</b> <b>feels</b> bad and is generally avoided in the future.
