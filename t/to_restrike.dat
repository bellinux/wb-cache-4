5000|$|Most Kiribati coins are dated 1979, marking {{an event}} to cooincide with independence, {{but with some}} exception. In 1992, Kiribati began {{producing}} 1 and 2 cent pieces in copper-steel clad and 5 cent pieces in nickel-steel clad restruck off of 1979 planchets. These coins are distinct in their luster and obvious attraction to a magnet and were produced to compensate for Australia's discontinuation of the two lowest denominations. However, a small mintage of the 1992 issue 1 cent was struck in bronze. 10, 20, 50, and $1 coins have yet to appear as later issues and do not appear <b>to</b> be <b>restrike</b> coins. So most of the denominations remain as a single date issue. Although Kiribati retained 1 and 2 cent coins well after Australia demoted theirs, redundancy and devaluation has slowly removed these coins from general circulation.|$|R

2500|$|As the Civil War continued, {{the cost}} of the war loomed large. Any {{precious}} metals available in the South often made their way to Europe to procure war goods. [...] But the CSA did manage to mint a few coins. In 1861, Mr. Robert Lovett Jr. of Philadelphia was commissioned to design, engrave and make a one cent piece for the Confederacy. On the obverse (front), he used the head of Minerva (French Liberty Head), which he had used on several store cards. The coins were struck using the then Federal standard of cupronickel for cent pieces. He made a few samples, of which only 12 are said to exist by the popular stories but research has shown that 14 are currently known to exist. Fearing prosecution for aiding the enemy, he stopped his work and hid the coins and dies in his cellar.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of low pressure sodium lamps {{is that the}} colour is pure yellow, so the illuminated scene is seen without any colour differentiation.

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious <b>restrikes</b> <b>to</b> sell to collectors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As {{a central}} {{component}} of any existing AC substation, disconnector switches {{are responsible for}} providing isolation between grid-connected and safely approachable sections of bus. Additionally, they can provide the capability of transferring load currents between different busses. Due to the excellent performance history in AC, possible challenges for disconnector switches in future HVDC substations were identified by comparing computed effects of DC stress to the standardized capabilities of existing AC disconnector switches. It was found that pure, time-constant DC voltages and currents will not lead to excessive stress onto disconnector switches. However, voltage and current ripples present in real HVDC systems can give rise to considerably different results. Ripples exhibiting a 1 /f decay in magnitude up to the 30 th harmonic were utilized in calculations. Similarly to AC, switching of sections of bus can lead <b>to</b> multiple <b>restrikes</b> or prestrikes, potentially resulting in very fast transients. The maximum voltage collapse exhibits a strong dependence on {{the magnitude of the}} voltage ripple. Transferring load currents between different busses {{has been shown to be}} possible under DC conditions. However, the recovery voltage as well as the extinction process itself depend heavily on the current ripple. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceArc voltage {{fluctuations}} are {{studied for}} two different plasma torches. One {{of them is}} home-made, {{the other is a}} Sultzer Metco plasma torch. Both work under similar operating conditions, but they show very different voltage waveforms and spectra, depending on their electrode configurations. The first torch shows a rather intermittent behaviour and works under the restrike mode with a rather low fluctuation amplitude and with non-reproducible spectral components. The second torch also shows characteristic features related <b>to</b> the <b>restrike</b> mode, but they are superimposed on more regular oscillations which are due to pressure variations in the cold gas chamber, located upstream the arc region. This part of the torch together with the nozzle channel appears to be a Helmholtz resonator, whose resonance frequency is theoretically evaluated {{as a function of the}} torch geometry and of the operating conditions. The theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with the measured frequency of the main peak in the voltage spectrum of the second torch. A discussion about the coupling between the pressure and the voltage is proposed to explain how the torch design could influence the Helmholtz resonance...|$|R
50|$|With two exceptions, {{all issues}} of the Society of Medalists were {{initially}} manufactured in bronze. Issues 28 and 29, created during World War II, were first produced in silver. During the 1970s the Society undertook a program <b>to</b> <b>restrike</b> its earlier issues in silver.

50|$|Many daisy wheel {{machines}} offer a {{bold type}} facility, accomplished by double- or triple-striking the specified character(s); servo-based printers advance the carriage fractionally for a wider (and therefore blacker) character, while cheaper machines perform a carriage return without a line feed {{to return to}} the beginning of the line, space through all non-bold text, and restrike each bolded character. The inherent imprecision in attempting <b>to</b> <b>restrike</b> on exactly the same spot after a carriage return provides the same effect as the more expensive servo-based printers, with the unique side effect that as the printer ages and wears, bold text becomes bolder.|$|E
50|$|Self-ballasted (SB) lamps are mercury vapor lamps with a {{filament}} inside {{connected in}} series with the arc tube that functions as an electrical ballast. This is {{the only kind of}} mercury vapor lamp that should be connected directly to the mains without an external ballast. These lamps have only the same or slightly higher efficiency than incandescent lamps of similar size, but have a longer life. They give light immediately on startup, but usually needs a few minutes <b>to</b> <b>restrike</b> if power has been interrupted. Because of the light emitted by the filament, they have slightly better color rendering properties than mercury vapor lamps.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among {{the public in the}} mid-nineteenth century, there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling restrikes of Gobrecht dollars and trading them for rare medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the restrikes went toward purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The restrikes created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling restrikes of early American coins for their own profit. All Gobrecht dollar restrikes, when tilted on their axis, depict the reverse eagle flying level, rather than upward as it is depicted on the coins struck during the official production run. It is unknown precisely why the orientation of the eagle was altered, though it is believed by many numismatists that Snowden did this intentionally <b>to</b> make <b>restrikes</b> distinguishable from originals. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, its designer, had borrowed Gobrecht and Peale's eagle reverse for the one-cent coin's obverse.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{high frequency}} arc instabilities observed in subsonic-arc-attachment thrusters, a 3 kW, segmented-anode arc jet {{was designed and}} tested using hydrogen as the propellant. The thruster nozzle geometry was scaled from a 30 kW design previously tested in the 1960 's. By observing the current to each segment and the arc voltage, {{it was determined that}} the 75 - 200 kHz instabilities were results of axial movements of the arc anode attachment point. The arc attachment point was fully contained in the subsonic portion of the nozzle for nearly all flow rates. The effects of isolating selected segments were investigated. In some cases, forcing the arc downstream caused the <b>restrike</b> <b>to</b> cease. Finally, decreasing the background pressure from 18 to 0. 05 Pa affected the pressure distribution in the nozzle including the pressure in the subsonic arc chamber...|$|R
25|$|As {{the result}} of an 1879 article about the Confederate cent printed in a New York City newspaper, Benjamin F.

Mason bought the die and coin from Taylor and sold them to J.W. Scott Co. of New York City, a coin and stamp dealer. Scott bought 500 1861 United States half dollars from a New York bank that were supposedly struck at the New Orleans Mint. Scott had the reverse of the half dollars planed down and performed a one-sided strike using the Confederate half dollar die. The Seated Liberty obverse of the coins were flattened some because of the one-sided strike. In addition, Scott struck 500 half dollar sized tokens in white metal using the Confederate die and a newly made die <b>to</b> commemorate the <b>restrikes</b> of the Confederate half dollars.

50|$|When a mercury vapor lamp {{is first}} turned on, it {{will produce a}} dark blue glow because {{only a small amount}} of the mercury is ionized and the gas {{pressure}} in the arc tube is very low, so much of the light is produced in the ultraviolet mercury bands. As the main arc strikes and the gas heats up and increases in pressure, the light shifts into the visible range and the high gas pressure causes the mercury emission bands to broaden somewhat, producing a light that appears more nearly white to the human eye, although it is still not a continuous spectrum. Even at full intensity, the light from a mercury vapor lamp with no phosphors is distinctly bluish in color. The pressure in the quartz arc-tube rises to approximately one atmosphere once the bulb has reached its working temperature. If the discharge should be interrupted (e.g. by interruption of the electric supply), it is not possible for the lamp <b>to</b> <b>restrike</b> until the bulb cools enough for the pressure to fall considerably. The reason for a prolonged period of time before the lamp restrikes is because mercury vapor ballasts along with other HID lamp ballasts send relatively low voltage to the lamp upon start up, but as pressure increases inside the arc-tube, higher voltage is required to keep the lamp lit so the ballast sends higher voltage to the lamp. Once the ballast is shut off and turned on again, it starts over at a low voltage but if the lamp is still hot, then high pressure inside the arc-tube prevents the lamp from striking an arc and turning on.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present in}} this paper a {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) modelling of the gliding arc behaviour of a dc plasma torch operating with air under low current and high voltage conditions. The low current leads to instabilities and difficulties with simulating the process because the magnetic field {{is not sufficient to}} constrict the arc. The model is 3 D, time dependent and the MHD equations are solved using CFD software Code_Saturne®. Although the arc is definitively non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the LTE assumption is considered as a first approach. The injection of air is tangential.

40|$|Circuit-breakers (CBs) {{are subject}} to {{electrical}} stresses with restrikes during capacitor bank operation. Stresses are caused by the overvoltages across CBs, the interrupting currents {{and the rate of}} rise of recovery voltage (RRRV). Such electrical stresses also depend on the types of system grounding and the types of dielectric strength curves.

The simulation of SF 6 CB stresses in a typical 400 kV system was undertaken and the results in the applications are presented. The simulated restrike waveforms produced with the identified features using wavelet transform can be used for restrike diagnostic algorithm development with wavelet transform to locate a substation with breaker restrikes.

40|$|A breaker {{restrike}} is {{an abnormal}} arcing phenomenon, {{leading to a}} possible breaker failure. Eventually, this failure leads to interruption of the transmission and distribution of the electricity supply system until the breaker is replaced. Before 2008, there was little evidence {{in the literature of}} monitoring techniques based on restrike measurement and interpretation produced during switching of capacitor banks and shunt reactor banks in power systems. In 2008 a non-intrusive radiometric restrike measurement method and a restrike hardware detection algorithm were developed by M. S. Ramli and B. Kasztenny. However, the limitations of the radiometric measurement method are a band limited frequency response as well as limitations in amplitude determination. Current restrike detection methods and algorithms require the use of wide bandwidth current transformers and high voltage dividers. A restrike switch model using Alternative Transient Program (ATP) and Wavelet Transforms which support diagnostics are proposed. Restrike phenomena become a new diagnostic process using measurements, ATP and Wavelet Transforms for online interrupter monitoring. This research project investigates the restrike switch model Parameter „A. dielectric voltage gradient related to a normal and slowed case of the contact opening velocity and the escalation voltages, which {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool for a vacuum circuit-breaker (CB) at service voltages between 11 kV and 63 kV. During current interruption of an inductive load at current quenching or chopping, a transient voltage is developed across the contact gap. The dielectric strength of the gap should rise to a point to withstand this transient voltage. If it does not, the gap will flash over, resulting in a restrike. A straight line is fitted through the voltage points at flashover of the contact gap. This is the point at which the gap voltage has reached a value that exceeds the dielectric strength of the gap. This research shows that a change in opening contact velocity of the vacuum CB produces a corresponding change in the slope of the gap escalation voltage envelope. To investigate the diagnostic process, an ATP restrike switch model was modified with contact opening velocity computation for restrike waveform signature analyses along with experimental investigations. This also enhanced a mathematical CB model with the empirical dielectric model for SF 6 (sulphur hexa-fluoride) CBs at service voltages above 63 kV and a generalised dielectric curve model for 12 kV CBs. A CB restrike can be predicted if there is a similar type of restrike waveform signatures for measured and simulated waveforms. The restrike switch model applications are used for: computer simulations as virtual experiments, including predicting breaker restrikes; estimating the interrupter remaining life of SF 6 puffer CBs; checking system stresses; assessing point-on-wave (POW) operations; and for a restrike detection algorithm development using Wavelet Transforms. A simulated high frequency nozzle current magnitude was applied to an Equation (derived from the literature) which can calculate the life extension of the interrupter of a SF 6 high voltage CB. The restrike waveform signatures for a medium and high voltage CB identify its possible failure mechanism such as delayed opening, degraded dielectric strength and improper contact travel. The simulated and measured restrike waveform signatures are analysed using Matlab software for automatic detection. Experimental investigation of a 12 kV vacuum CB diagnostic was carried out for the parameter determination and a passive antenna calibration was also successfully developed with applications for field implementation. The degradation features were also evaluated with a predictive interpretation technique from the experiments, and the subsequent simulation indicates that the drop in voltage related to the slow opening velocity mechanism measurement to give a degree of contact degradation. A predictive interpretation technique is a computer modeling for assessing switching device performance, which allows one to vary a single parameter at a time; this is often difficult to do experimentally because of the variable contact opening velocity. The significance of this thesis outcome is that it is a non-intrusive method developed using measurements, ATP and Wavelet Transforms to predict and interpret a breaker restrike risk. The measurements on high voltage circuit-breakers can identify degradation that can interrupt the distribution and transmission of an electricity supply system. It is hoped that the techniques for the monitoring of restrike phenomena developed by this research will form part of a diagnostic process that will be valuable for detecting breaker stresses relating to the interrupter lifetime. Suggestions for future research, including a field implementation proposal <b>to</b> validate the <b>restrike</b> switch model for ATP system studies and the hot dielectric strength curve model for SF 6 CBs, are given in Appendix A...|$|R
