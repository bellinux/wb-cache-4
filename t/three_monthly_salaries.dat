40|$|Previous {{research}} on tropical home gardens stresses their ecological, economic, and social functions. This article a) describes home gardens (n = 252) in three {{rural areas of}} the Iberian Peninsula, b) explores motivations for gardening, and c) computes the gross financial benefits of crops in home gardens. Different from tropical gardens, the studied gardens specialize in edible plants, species with other uses being marginally present. Motivations for gardening relate more to people's way of living (i. e., hobby, keeping traditions) than to economic reasons. The average gross financial value of home gardens in our sample is 1, 691 €/year/gardener, equivalent to almost <b>three</b> minimal <b>monthly</b> <b>salaries</b> in Spain. Home gardens seem to also provide noneconomic benefits that help explain the maintenance of those agroecosystems. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Drug {{interactions}} {{form part}} of current clinical practice and they affect between 3 and 5 % of polypharmacy patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the frequency of potential drug-drug interactions in prescriptions for adult and elderly patients. TYPE OF STUDY AND SETTING: Cross-sectional pharmacoepidemiological survey in the Parque Verde housing project, municipality of Cascavel, Paraná, Brazil, between December 2006 and February 2007. METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling, proportional to the total number of homes in the housing project, was used. The sample consisted of 95 homes and 96 male or female patients aged 19 or over, with medical prescriptions for at least two pharmaceutical drugs. Interactions were identified using DrugDigest, Medscape and Micromedex softwares. RESULTS: Most of the patients were female (69. 8 %), married (59. 4 %) and in the age group of 60 years or over (56. 3 %), with an income less than or equal to <b>three</b> minimum <b>monthly</b> <b>salaries</b> (81. 3 %) and less than eight years of schooling (69. 8 %); 90. 6 % of the patients were living with another person. The total number of pharmaceutical drugs was 406 (average of 4. 2 medications per patient). The drugs most prescribed were antihypertensives (47. 5 %). The frequency of drug interactions was 66. 6 %. Among the 154 potential drug interactions, 4. 6 % were classified as major, 65. 6 % as moderate and 20. 1 % as minor. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of drug prescriptions with a potential for differentiated interactions indicates a situation that has so far been little explored, albeit a reality in household surveys...|$|R

Her colleague Ruth La Ferla found a different opinion from industry insiders after a special preview screening. Most found the fashion in the movie too safe and the beauty too overstated, more in tune with the 1980s than the 2000s.

The amount of <b>monthly</b> <b>salary</b> is decided mainly by two attributes of each employee. The one is the age of each employee or years of their service with the firm.

The system applies to all the full time standard employees, not only white collars but also blue collars. They are union members when the enterprise-wide trade union organizes the firm.
