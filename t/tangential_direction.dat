25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the <b>tangential</b> <b>direction</b> and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).|$|E
2500|$|It is {{reported}} that {{the ratio of the}} longitudinal to the transverse (radial and tangential) diffusion rates for wood ranges from about 100 at a moisture content of 5%, to 2 - 4 at a moisture content of 25% (Langrish and Walker, 1993). Radial diffusion is somewhat faster than tangential diffusion. Although longitudinal diffusion is most rapid, it is of practical importance only when short pieces are dried. Generally the timber boards are much longer than in width or thickness. For example, a typical size of a green board used for this research was 6 m long, 250mm in width and 43mm in thickness. If the boards are quartersawn, then the width will be in the radial direction whereas the thickness will be in <b>tangential</b> <b>direction,</b> and vice versa for plain-sawn boards.

40|$|The {{challenge}} in numerical modeling of wood {{is to have}} the model closely match the structure of a real specimen. The model should account for heterogeneity, such as wood grain, growth rings, etc., and for anisotropy of each phase. In some problems, the model should also match realistic morpholo-gies of specimens. This paper presents numerical results for transverse modulus and for transverse fracture using methods that explicitly account for earlywood and latewood and account for anisotropy in the radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>directions.</b> The fracture results analyzed a realistic morphology using digitized image of an actual specimen. A companion, imaged representation of radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>directions</b> was used to include anisotropy in the transverse plane.

In contrast to the measure-theoretic approach of these authors, we follow a differential variational approach and address a broader class of problems with multiple elastic or inelastic impacts.
