40|$|The author calls upon criminologists to {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> of states committed {{within their own}} territories, but also <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> of empires, which constitute <b>the</b> greatest <b>crimes</b> outside their territories.

The author argues that this first requires recognizing {{the centrality of the}} concept of empire and making the case for national and international controls of <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> that stem from it...|$|R
