This work combines the oversampling technology with the run-length encoding compression algorithm with an error factor to further enhance the compression performance of <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> in a multichannel acquisition system.

The TDDS also archives <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> on floppy disks, nine-track tapes, and magneto-optical disc cartridges. The PC-based, semi-automated, TDDS digitizes, time stamps, formats, and archives frequency modulated (FM) or pulse code modulated (PCM) <b>telemetry</b> <b>data.</b> An analog <b>tape</b> or a real-time signal may provide the <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> source. The TDDS accepts IRIG A, B, G, H, and NASA 36 analog code sources for time stamp data. The output time tag includes time, frame, and subframe status information. <b>Telemetry</b> <b>data</b> may be time stamped based upon a user-specified number of frames, subframes, or words. Once recorded, the TDDS performs data quality testing, formatting, and validation and logs the results automatically. <b>Telemetry</b> <b>data</b> is quality checked to ensure a good analog source track was selected. Raw <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> is formatted by dividing the data into records and appending header information.

Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> <b>tapes</b> are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 <b>telemetry</b> <b>tapes</b> were different from the <b>telemetry</b> <b>tapes</b> of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with <b>telemetry</b> <b>data,</b> was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the <b>telemetry</b> <b>tapes</b> from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.|$|R

Adaptation of space <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> transport and processing standards {{such as those}} specified by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standards and those required for commercial ground distribution of <b>telemetry</b> <b>data,</b> will drive these functional and performance requirements.

At NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), the design and development of generic ground <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> system elements, {{over the last five}} years, has resulted in significant solutions to these problems. This solution, referred to as the functional components approach includes both hardware and software components ready for end user application.

40|$|Abstract—Storing {{vast amounts}} of multidimensional <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> {{presents}} a challenge. <b>Telemetry</b> <b>data</b> being relayed from sensors to the ground station {{comes in the form}} of text, images, audio, and various other formats. Compressing this data would optimize bandwidth usage during transmission and reduce storage resources needed at the ground level. However, the multitude of heterogeneous data types present in <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> and the need for data precision makes compression quite difficult. The application of a single compression technique for all data types usually yields ineffective results. We will present a <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> compression algorithm that utilizes Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) along with different compression algorithms for different data types, including Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) and Flate (which combines LZW with adaptive Huffman coding) for textual and numerical data and JPEG coding for images. Although these algorithms do not yield the greatest compression ratios, the Portable Document Format (PDF) standard supports decoding of all of them, which allows us to write our encoded data streams directly to a PDF file. This approach alleviates the need for traditional database storage systems. It also standardizes and simplifies the data retrieval, decoding, and viewing process. This work results in packets-oriented <b>telemetry</b> <b>data</b> encapsulated with multiple compression stream algorithms, which can be decoded, rendered and viewed by any standard PDF viewer. This paper presents the aforementioned algorithms and its development status as applicable proof...|$|R
