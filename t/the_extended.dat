40|$|Aiming at a Top Gas Recovery Turbine Unit (TRT) {{with double}} support rotor and <b>the</b> <b>extending</b> disk end, {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis about influence of cylindrical bearing and four-lobe bearing on vibration of TRT rotor system are conducted in this paper. The {{results indicate that}} vibration of the rotor supported by cylindrical bearing is more stable than that supported by four-lobe bearing at the driving end (DE) and the nondriving end (NDE). The amplitude of rotor is supported by both {{of these types of}} bearing increases as the speed increases at the NDE, while the amplitude of the DE remains unchanged. Comparing with the result of theoretical analysis, the practical test results are more consistent with the theoretical response analysis conducted by applying unbalanced mass at <b>the</b> <b>extending</b> disk end. This paper presents an analysis method of the critical characteristics of a double support rotor system with <b>the</b> <b>extending</b> disk end and provides reference value for dealing with vibration fault of double support rotor system with <b>the</b> <b>extending</b> disk end...|$|R
