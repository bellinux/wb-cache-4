40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between lead hip kinematics, weight bearing patterns and lumbar kinematic differences between golfers who experience golf related low back pain and golfers who do not. Methods: A total of 12 amateur male golfers were recruited, 7 without low back pain and 5 with low back pain. IRED motion capture was used to determine kinematics and two force plates were used to collect kinetic data. Results: Low back pain golfers externally rotated their lead hip significantly less during address (p= 0. 048), and internally rotated their lead hip significantly more at peak follow through (p= 0. 030) than golfers without low back pain. Golfers with low back pain bore significantly more body weight on their rear leg (p= 0. 030) at peak follow through then golfers without low back pain. No statistically significant difference was found between groups for lumbar spine kinematics at any phases of the swing. Conclusion: This study identified a significant relationship between the orientation of the lead leg segment during <b>the</b> <b>address</b> <b>position</b> and at peak follow through with respect to golf related low back pain. These findings may be an important teaching tool for reducing the risk of golf related low back pain...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{extendible}} array storage mappings (esm's) have envisioned arrays as expanding via {{a sequence of}} adjunctions of rows and/or columns. Another mechanism for array expansion is the successive (row-wise or column-wise) concatenation of already stored arrays. This type of expansion is facilitated if <b>the</b> <b>addresses</b> of <b>positions</b> of <b>the</b> resultant composite arrays can be obtained easily and systematically from <b>the</b> <b>addresses</b> of <b>positions</b> of <b>the</b> constituent arrays. A property of esm's, termed translatability, is introduced and is argued intuitively to guarantee easy concatenation of stored arrays. The class of persistent two-dimensional translatable esm's is {{shown to be a}} one-parameter family of esm's whose initial member is the familiar diagnonal pairing function. The derived explicit form of these esm's permits one to argue algorithmically that they afford one easy concatenation of stored arrays...|$|R

Steering a path between two polarised positions, which respectively highlight national closure and post-national expansion, the article outlines the concept of ?civic stratification? and its use as a means for the management of migration. This concept was first developed by David Lockwood (1996) in relation to the inequalities generated within citizenship, and it refers to a pattern of inequality by virtue of rights granted or denied by the state. In the present article it is given a broader application in <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> {{of transnational}} migrants. The formal dimension of civic stratification, referring to legal status, and its informal dimension, which refers to ?moral and material resources?, are used to outline a possible relationship between the treatment of migrants through the structuring of immigration law and broader public perceptions of their standing in society...|$|R

China is currently experiencing an extremely dynamic industrialisation process, and worldwide foreign direct investment in industry is concentrating strongly in the People’s Republic. A comparative study of developments in the automotive and infocom industries examines a number of issues. Firstly, differences in development dynamics and corporate strategy in the two industries are examined. Secondly, the demands multinational companies make of their locations in China and their supplier structures are investigated. Thirdly, differences in the “embedding ” of the new multinational company locations in China are investigated. Particularly interesting is the development of territorially integrated production clusters and the role of industrial parks. The fourth issue to be looked at is the impact of developments in China on actors and locations in Germany...|$|R

It {{is argued that}} the drive towards a network economy - often global in nature -has far reaching implications for the economic and geographical profile of border regions. The paper starts off from a theoretical perspective and shows that modern network theory - in combination with transaction cost theory - may offer a meaningful operational analytical framework for understanding the changing positions of regions in our world. A major question is then whether the new spatial dynamics will lead to convergence or divergence patterns among regions. A critical overview of convergence theories - {{against the background of}} globalisation phenomena - is then given. It is argued that there is a tendency towards club convergence. The consequences for regional development policy are next spelt out. There is no uniform policy panacea; policy strategies have to be fine-tuned and tailor-made, and should <b>address</b> <b>the</b> specific needs and opportunities of regions. Finally, the position of border regions is revisited. It is argued that accessibility polities aiming to alleviate the negative consequences of peripheral location deserve priority, provided the region has sufficient economic self-reliance to cope with competition from outside. ...|$|R
