40|$|Experimental {{results from}} three {{different}} full scale arrays of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) under natural wind conditions are presented. The wind velocities throughout the turbine arrays are measured using a portable meteorological tower with seven, vertically staggered, three-component ultrasonic anemometers. The power output of each turbine is recorded simultaneously. The comparison between the horizontal and vertical energy transport for the different <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> sizes shows the importance of vertical transport for large array configurations. Quadrant-hole analysis is employed {{to gain a better}} understanding of the vertical energy transport at the top of the VAWT arrays. The results show a striking similarity between the flows in the VAWT arrays and the adjustment region of canopies. Namely, an increase in ejections and sweeps and decrease in inward and outward interactions occur inside the <b>turbine</b> <b>array.</b> Ejections are the strongest contributor, which is in agreement with the literature on evolving and sparse canopy flows. The influence of the <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> size on the power output of the downstream turbines is examined by comparing a streamwise row of four single turbines with square arrays of nine turbine pairs. The results suggest that a new boundary layer forms on top of the larger turbine arrays as the flow adjusts to the new roughness length. This increases the turbulent energy transport over the whole planform area of the <b>turbine</b> <b>array.</b> By contrast, for the four single turbines, the vertical energy transport due to turbulent fluctuations is only increased in the near wake of the turbines. These findings add to the knowledge of energy transport in turbine arrays and therefore the optimization of the turbine spacing in wind farms...|$|E

40|$|A two-scale {{modelling}} {{approach is}} discussed {{to predict the}} performance and energetics {{of a large number}} (more than a few hundred) of marine turbines installed as a power farm in a general coastal environment. The kernel of this approach is that the outer, or coastal-scale, model/simulation is to assess the reduction of flow passing through a given farm area {{as a function of the}} increase of head loss across the farm, whereas the inner, or device-scale, model/simulation employs this function to account for the (otherwise unknown) effect of coastal dynamics for that farm site, i. e. diminution of the power removed from the farm area due to the reduction of flow through the farm. Large-eddy simulations (LES) of periodic open channel flow (with a porous plate model representing turbines) are then presented as a device-scale part of such a two-scale model of large marine <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays.</b> Results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach to study how the overall energetics of <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays</b> (i. e. extraction, dissipation and diminution of energy within the entire farm area) may change depending on the characteristics of the farm site, array configuration and operating conditions of the turbines in the farm.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} flow field within {{an array of}} 18 counter-rotating, vertical-axis wind {{turbines}} (VAWTs), {{with an emphasis on}} the fluxes of mean and turbulence kinetic energy. The turbine wakes and the recovery of the mean wind speed between the turbine rows are derived from measurements of the velocity field using a portable meteorological tower with seven, vertically-staggered, three-component ultrasonic anemometers. The data provide insight to the blockage effect of both the individual turbine pairs within the array and the <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> as a whole. The horizontal and planform kinetic energy fluxes into the <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> are analyzed, and various models for the roughness length of the <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> are compared. A high planform kinetic energy flux is measured for the VAWT array, which facilitates rapid flow recovery in the wake region behind the turbine pairs. Flow velocities return to 95 % of the upwind value within six rotor diameters downwind from each turbine pair. This is less than half the recovery distance behind a typical horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). The observed high level of the planform kinetic energy flux is correlated with higher relative roughness lengths for the VAWT array as compared to HAWT farms. This result is especially relevant for large wind farms with horizontal dimensions comparable to the height of the atmospheric boundary layer. As shown in recent work and confirmed here, the planform kinetic energy flux can be the dominant source of energy in such large-scale wind farms...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of wind tunnel experiments performed for various model wind turbine arrays. The aim is to understand how siting affects power output. To optimize wind farm efficiency the experiments vary the parameters of the model wind turbines and the layout of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>array.</b> The parameters include the alignment, height, spacing, and the rotational direction of the model wind turbines. These experiments employ mechanical torque sensors to simultaneously measure the torque and rotor angular velocity, which yields a direct measurement of the fluid mechanical power extracted by the turbine at multiple locations. For a 4 × 3 array, the power is calculated at the center turbine in each of the rows. Variations in wind farm efficiency ranging from 55 % to 90 % are observed between the 13 different layouts tested. Modifications to the layout of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> clearly affects the power output of the wind turbines downstream.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the planform kinetic energy flux in this paper contains an error. The equation stated in the manuscript, Pvert ≈−ρAplanu , is correct. However, a typographical error in the data processing code {{had the effect of}} calculating the planform kinetic energy flux using u 2 instead of u. This error caused a quantitative change in the planform kinetic energy flux {{as can be seen in}} the revised version of Figure 7. Figure 7. Contours of the power transport due to the planform kinetic energy flux along the centre of the <b>turbine</b> <b>array.</b> The three turbine pairs are indicated as vertical bars. Upon correction, the planform kinetic energy flux is lower than originally stated. In the region in front of the <b>turbine</b> <b>array,</b> it is 2. 2 W/m 2 instead of 17 W/m 2. The average planform kinetic energy flux into the <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> from 2 D downwind of the second turbine pair to 7. 5 D downwind of the third sensor pair is 3. 4 W/m 2 for the highest sensor position and 0. 03 W/m 2 for the lowest sensor position; values of 22 W/m 2 and 0. 4 W/m 2, respectively, were stated in the paper. The correction leads to a planform kinetic energy flux of 316 W per turbine pair which is approximately one-third of the power that is extracted by the turbine pair. Furthermore, the corrected results lead to the conclusion that the Frandsen formula gives the better estimate of the planform kinetic energy flux. The Frandsen estimate is off by 76 % while the Lettau is off by a factor of 8. 5. While the conclusions of the manuscript are largely unchanged, the corrected data indicate that the planform kinetic energy flux is not sufficient to account for the total powe...|$|E

The Inner Sound of Stroma in particular has attracted significant commercial interest. To understand potential environmental impacts of the installation of a tidal <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> a case study based upon the Inner Sound is considered. A numerical computational fluid dynamics model, Fluidity, is used to conduct a series of depth-averaged simulations to investigate velocity and bed shear stress changes due to the presence of idealised tidal turbine arrays.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our initial}} work in performing large-eddy simulations of tidal <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> flows. First, a horizontally-periodic precursor simulation is performed to create turbulent flow data. Then that data {{is used as}} inflow into a tidal <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> two rows deep and infinitely wide. The turbines are modeled using rotating actuator lines, and the finite-volume method is used to solve the governing equations. In studying the wakes created by the turbines, we observed that the vertical shear of the inflow combined with wake rotation causes lateral wake asymmetry. Also, various turbine configurations are simulated, and the total power production relative to isolated turbines is examined. Staggering consecutive rows of turbines in the simulated configurations allows the greatest efficiency using the least downstream row spacing. Counter-rotating consecutive downstream turbines in a non-staggered array shows a small benefit. This work has identified areas for improvement, {{such as the use}} of a larger precursor domain to better capture elongated turbulent structures, the inclusion of salinity and temperature equations to account for density stratification and its effect on turbulence, improved wall shear stress modelling, and the examination of more array configurations...|$|E

The results show that optimum spacings for multi-row arrays with regard to power yield are 3 – 4 rotor diameters (RD) across-stream and 1 – 4 RD along-stream, and that turbines in downstream rows should be staggered to avoid wake effects of upstream turbines and to make use of the accelerated flows induced by adjacent upstream turbines...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{momentum}} {{actuator disc}} theory (LMADT) is extended to address the power available to a tidal <b>turbine</b> <b>array</b> spanning the cross-section of an open channel flow. A generalised formulation is presented which relaxes constraints in previous models on the Froude number of the flow and geometry of the <b>turbine</b> <b>array,</b> and also considers the effects of far-wake mixing on the overall power removed from the flow. In the limiting case of no free surface deformation, the rigid-lid model of Garret and Cummins (2007) is recovered. Blockage, the ratio of turbine frontal area to the cross-sectional area of the surrounding flow passage, has the greatest effect on available power, with the peak power coefficient increasing by 55 % from 0. 60 to 0. 93 as the blockage ratio increases from 0. 05 to 0. 20. A further 3 % increase in peak power coefficient is achieved as the Froude number increases from 0. 05 to 0. 20. The efficiency of energy extraction may be determined relative to the total power extracted from the flow, comprised of the power available to the turbines, and the power dissipated in wake mixing.

This power increase due to the local blockage can be enhanced further, but only slightly for the case of 9 turbines, by arranging turbines vertically as well as horizontally.

However since no large marine current <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays</b> currently exist, validation of methods for simulating energy extraction relies upon scaled down laboratory experiments. We present results from an experiment using porous fences spanning {{the width of}} a recirculating flume to simulate flow through large, regular, multi-row marine current <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays.</b> Measurements of fence drag, free surface elevation drop and velocity distribution were obtained to validate a method for parameterising array drag in the distributed drag approach, which is typically implemented in regional scale models. The effect of array density was also investigated by varying the spacing between fences. Two different inflow conditions were used; the first used the flume bed in its natural state, whilst the second used roughness strips on the flume bed to significantly enhance ambient turbulence intensity to levels similar to those recorded at tidal sites. For realistic array densities (&lt; 0. 07), a depth averaged formulation of effective array drag coefficient agreed within 10 % of that derived from experimental results for both inflow conditions. The validity of the distributed drag approach was shown to be dependent on longitudinal row spacing between porous fences and ambient turbulence intensity, two features that determine the level of wake recovery downstream of each porous fence. Finally a force balance analysis quantified the change in bed drag {{as a result of the}} presence of porous fence arrays. Adding arrays to the flow gave an increase in bed drag coefficient of up to 95 % which was 20 % of the total added bed and array drag coefficient.

Based on this, the system state transition sampling method for calculating the loss of expected energy index with high DG penetration is proposed. The state transition models for non-active elements and DGs are established. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by a study case. The method can be used for the low-carbon benefit analysis on DG penetration distribution networks.|$|R

Breeding and {{overland}} {{flight of}} red-throated divers Gavia stellata at Smøla, Norway, {{in relation to}} the Smøla wind farm. – NINA Report 297. 26 pp. This report surveys the distribution and breeding success of red-throated divers Gavia stellata on the island of Smøla, Norway in the breeding seasons 1999 - 2004 inclusive, and 2007. Dur-ing this period, a large windfarm was constructed in the northwestern portion of the island in two stages. Stage 1, 20 2 MW turbines, was constructed between September 2001 and Sep-tember 2002; stage 2, 48 2. 3 MW turbines, between October 2003 and October 2005. A total of twenty three breeding sites were found, up to twenty of which were used in any given year, though more typically 10 - 13 pairs would breed each year. Overall fledging success was 0. 42 chicks/pair/year, similar to other coastal breeding populations. Whole-island breeding suc-cess in 2007, the first post-construction year for which we have data, was 0. 15 chicks/pair; however, strong fluctuations in breeding success between years are normal in this species and it seems unlikely that the windfarm was a factor in this result as all breeding sites in 2007 were some distance away. Three red-throated diver breeding locations were noted within the windfarm area prior to con-struction, none of which have been used in years following construction of the stage in which each breeding site lies. It is unclear if {{this is due to the}} presence of the wind turbines in them-selves, increased disturbance due to easier human access to the area, and/or lingering effects of the extreme disturbance concomitant with construction. Although 46 hours and 20 minutes of structured observations were made within the windfarm area, and many more of unstructured observations by all scientists working in the windfarm area throughout the breeding season, not a single red-throated diver was observed to fly through the windfarm area, suggesting strong avoidance. At least four pairs breed in central areas of the island where the coast on the far side of the <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays</b> is, albeit by a small margin, the closest potential feeding habitat. The <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays</b> were checked regularly using a specially trained dog for birdstrike casual-ties. Although many such birds were found, mainly sea eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, grouse Lagopus lagopus, and waders, no red-throated diver corpses were recovered. Taken with the lack of observations of red-throated divers breeding in, or flying through, the windfarm area, this suggests that the risk of direct mortality from collisions at this location is very low. Further monitoring may include surveys early in the breeding season to determine if red-throated divers visit the wind farm area at that time, and so might resume breeding now that the construction phase and attendant disturbance is at an end; and focussed observations of the direction of feeding flights to and from the breeding sites on the central mire of the island, to determine whether these birds are simply preferring other feeding areas to those on the coast off the wind farm, or actively avoiding flight directions which would take them through the <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays.</b> Smøla; red-throated diver, Gavia stellata, windfarm, wind turbines, distribution, breeding, flight, population, Smøla, smålom, Gavia stellata, vindkraft, distribusjon, hekkebiologi, fluktadferd, bestan...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow field}} {{characteristics}} {{in the wake}} of an isolated tidal turbine and tidal <b>turbine</b> <b>arrays</b> of up to four devices is investigated by numerical simulations solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation in the Open Source OpenFOAM CFD solver {{to make use of the}} significantly increased availability of computational resources and multi-core processing. Transient simulations utilizing the k – ω SST turbulence closure model were used in combination with a dynamic mesh interface to account for the rotation of the three bladed tidal turbine at constant tip speed ratio, the applicability of dynamic mesh simulations for the investigation of array wakes has been shown. The velocity and turbulence characteristics are compared to experiments previously conducted with a number of small scale tidal turbine devices arranged in staggered array formations and tested within a low ambient turbulence circulating water channel. Results showed good agreement between simulations and experiments and further insight to the flow field within an array is provided, however further improvements to predict the wake characteristics in array are required...|$|R
