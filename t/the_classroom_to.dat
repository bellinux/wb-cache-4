5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E

50|$|The third {{renovation}} was {{the introduction}} of an intercom system, enabling live conversations between the officials and students from each classroom. All classrooms were equipped with AHUJA WS-661T/WS-664T intercom system, making the first higher secondary school in Kerala to have such system. Despite the capability of the intercom system to receive voice from <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office, the system only provides voice from <b>the</b> office <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> This was due to high need of audio wires and receivers that are required to send voice from <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office, especially in such a multi storied school with over hundred <b>classrooms.</b> <b>The</b> system is also used as an emergency alarm, as seen through its usage during the building collapse in 2005.|$|R

25|$|When Suzuki entered {{school he}} became aware that his family was very poor. Suzuki was {{sensitive}} and kind but prone to quick bursts of anger. The other boys ridiculed him for his shaved head and for being {{the son of a}} priest. He preferred staying in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> playing in the schoolyard, and was always {{at the top of his}} class. His teacher told him that he should grow up to be a great man, and to do this he needed to leave Kanagawa Prefecture and study hard.|$|E
30|$|The {{leadership}} often {{begins with}} establishing a vision and providing clear expectations for teachers, but continues as support and guidance for teachers’ technology use in <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> Evidence from <b>the</b> studies, suggest that most teachers had little prior {{experience with the}} activities they were being asked to do. In each of the schools observed, the principals, technology coordinators, and trainers were consistently inside <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> <b>to</b> provide support, suggestions, and encouragement.|$|R

25|$|The {{origins of}} amateur radio {{can be traced}} to the late 19th century, but amateur radio as practiced today began in the early 20th century. The First Annual Official Wireless Blue Book of the Wireless Association of America, {{produced}} in 1909, contains a list of amateur radio stations. This radio callbook lists wireless telegraph stations in Canada and the United States, including 89 amateur radio stations. As with radio in general, amateur radio was associated with various amateur experimenters and hobbyists. Amateur radio enthusiasts have significantly contributed to science, engineering, industry, and social services. Research by amateur operators has founded new industries, built economies, empowered nations, and saved lives in times of emergency. Ham radio can also be used in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> teach English, map skills, geography, math, science, and computer skills.|$|E
25|$|Beck also hired {{a talented}} early {{graduate}} of the Academy, Joseph Henry, to return as a science teacher after he finished his studies at Union College in nearby Schenectady in a year. In addition to teaching science, Henry did research at the school {{with the help of}} his assistant and students. In 1827, he began experiments with electromagnetism, a recent discovery. He found ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet, and discovered electrical inductance. Often he would demonstrate these properties to students by using a wire routed around <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> make an iron bar ring a small bell. This was not only the prototype of the modern electric doorbell, the stronger electrical signal he was able to send over a wire eventually helped Samuel F.B. Morse develop the first practical telegraph. The same principle continues to make long-distance wired data transmission possible. He would later leave to take a position at Princeton University, and eventually became the Smithsonian Institution's first secretary.|$|E
25|$|After {{his junior}} year, Division I coaches {{were lined up}} to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which {{included}} North Carolina and Syracuse. In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar'e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony's grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, {{he knew that he}} needed to improve in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> qualify academically for Syracuse. For his senior year, his mother considered transferring him to a different school. Anthony first thought of Virginia's Hargrave Military Academy but after talking to Steve Smith, the head coach at basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, he eventually transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia—winner of the USA Today 2000–01 high school championship—for his senior campaign. During the summer of 2001, Anthony led an AAU Baltimore Select team to the Final Four of the Adidas Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. Anthony attracted attention from the NBA by averaging 25.2 points a game in the tournament, which was also attended by Amar'e Stoudemire (who was already being touted as a future lottery pick). Anthony played at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival where he helped the East Team win the silver medal. He tied LeBron James for the tournament scoring lead at 24 points per game and shot 66 percent from the field. It was there that Anthony and James struck up a friendship.|$|E

The feasible combinations for these resources are the ones that avoid the conflicts between the teachers, classes, rooms and other specified requirements. Models formulated for scheduling problems are also case-sensitive and generally quite different from each other. Therefore, to establish the common features of the course scheduling problems is crucial. This paper presents a general view of course scheduling problems, formulate a high-school course scheduling problem which includes the common elements and the features of most of the course scheduling problems. 1 Introduction The course scheduling problem consists of scheduling {{a certain number of}} resources, such as classes, teachers, courses and <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> <b>to</b> a number of time-periods on a daily basis.

500|$|The case {{fractured}} the court; {{the nine}} justices issued {{a total of}} six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. [...] Finding diversity in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. [...] The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.|$|E

2500|$|Medical school also first {{appeared}} in the Medieval period. [...] This created a divide between physicians trained in the classroom and physicians who learned their trade through practice. [...] The divide created a shift leading to physicians trained in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>to</b> be of higher esteem and more knowledgeable. [...] Despite this, there was still a lack of knowledge by physicians in the militaries. [...] The knowledge of the militaries’ physicians was greatly acquired through first hand experience. [...] In the Medical schools, physicians such as Galen were referenced as the ultimate source of knowledge. [...] Thus, the education in the schools was aimed at proving these ancient physicians were correct. [...] This created issues as Medieval knowledge surpassed the knowledge of these ancient physicians. [...] In the scholastic setting it still became practice to reference ancient physicians or the other information being presented was not taken seriously.|$|E

Pennington fatally shot Hicks in the abdomen, and aimed his pistol at Calhoun without shooting him. Witnesses reported that Hicks pushed a female student away from himself before he was shot. Mandy Morse, a student inside the classroom, wrote a farewell letter to her family due to the fear she would be killed. Some students recalled Pennington threatening to kill other students, while others recall him telling the class he would commit suicide.|$|E
