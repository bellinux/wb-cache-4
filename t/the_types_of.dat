5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> collision that are possible.|$|E

5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. <b>The</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E

These associations were known to Army Counter-intelligence at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner Lewis Strauss.|$|E

40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use. Therefore, there are different ways of approaching the whole flammability issue. In this work, different approaches for analyzing the fire resistance of leather are examined: (i) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> tannage, (ii) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> leather, (iii) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> retannage, (iv) influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fatliquor, and (v) influence {{of the use of}} flame retardants.

However, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> leather, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> tannage, retannage and fatliquor effect the flammability behavior of leather.
