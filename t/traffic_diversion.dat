5|$|En {{route to}} his weekly squash game, a <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> reminds Perowne of the anti-war protests {{occurring}} that day. After being allowed through the diversion, he collides with another car, damaging its wing mirror. At first the driver, Baxter, tries to extort money from him. When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly recognises the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper {{presented}} at the 8 th World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems, 2001. The task of navigating in unfamiliar road environments is a common and demanding cognitive activity for drivers. Research has long demonstrated the problems that drivers have in planning and following efficient routes to destinations. If efficient routes cannot be planned and followed, the consequences are stress, frustration and delays for the driver, potentially unsafe road behaviour (e. g. late lane changes) and inappropriate traffic management (e. g. <b>traffic</b> <b>diversions</b> through small villages) ...|$|R
25|$|The Sofa Super Store {{site was}} on a major {{business}} and commuter artery feeding the suburbs and shopping centers of Charleston. Car traffic continued unabated for many critical minutes {{in the initial stages}} of the fire, driving over water supply lines and contributing to severe water supply problems, as the supply lines snaked from hydrants in surrounding blocks up to a half-mile away {{from the center of the}} fire. Eventually automobile traffic on Savannah Highway was stopped so water pressure would be more consistent, the <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> causing surrounding neighborhoods to fill with stranded commuters and onlookers. As the fire diminished and appeared contained, nearing 11:00 PM, surrounding neighborhoods began to clear and onlookers departed, most unaware of the loss of life during the blaze.|$|E

25|$|Another {{large group}} {{assembled}} {{at the intersection}} of Queen Street West and Spadina Avenue, presumably to conduct a protest, but were immediately surrounded by heavily armed police forces. Numerous s and media personnel were also in the crowd. Several arrests were made, including several members of the media and another CTV cameraman who was briefly held and then released; police later claimed that they had found weapons at the scene, and that they suspected the presence of more black bloc protesters within the crowd. The blockade caused <b>traffic</b> <b>diversions</b> and the stoppage of streetcar service along Spadina Avenue. After several hours of detainment in record-breaking heavy rain, police released the remainder of the crowd during the night.|$|R

Chief mourners were Ryan's wife Morah Ryan, from whom he was estranged, and her children Lottie, Rex, Bonnie, Elliot and Babette, whilst Verwoerd was also seated prominently. Babette clutched a teddy bear. Father Michael Collins, who often appeared as a religious correspondent - [...] "the Gerry Ryan padre and friend of this parish" [...] - on The Gerry Ryan Show, was the chief celebrant.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{sets out to}} provide an ex ante insight into the equity effects of a toll charge on the <b>traffic</b> <b>diversions</b> and {{geographical}} accessibility of work locations in the Cape Town metropolitan region, South Africa. Based on a static traffic assignment model and aggregate accessibility measures, computed in a GIS environment, {{the effects of a}} toll were estimated for different income categories for both a reference scenario and two toll scenarios. The findings indicate that particularly low-income commuters will divert to alternative routes. However, the results also indicate that the introduction of a toll will only have a limited impact on geographical accessibility. Nevertheless, because particularly low-income commuters are likely to divert to alternative routes, a toll should maybe not be levied on the road toward spatial justice without revenue redistribution or additional investment in the public transport system...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, the {{hospital}} went under lock down when a package was handed to the administrative staff of {{the hospital}}. When opened, mysterious white powder was discovered along with a note saying, [...] "ISIS {{is going to get}} you". The chilling message and contents of the package immediately sparked a major alert. Gardaí were called and quickly moved to seal off the main building - which houses only administrative staff - amid concern of a biological or chemical threat. A cordon was put in place and <b>traffic</b> <b>diversions</b> implemented around the hospital, which is located to the north-east of the midlands town. The army disposal unit from Athlone arrived to the building to examine and dispose of the substance. However, it was soon discovered to be a hoax, but the Gardaí were still on high alert.|$|R

5000|$|Residents along Cambie Boulevard {{created the}} Cambie Boulevard Heritage Society in 1994, which opposed any {{alteration}} {{to a wide}} green center median that is currently a grassy area with various species of trees, including cherry trees donated by the City of Yokohama on occasion of the 1967 Canadian Centennial. The residents had already been mobilized in 1989 {{in response to the}} possibility of elevated rail along Cambie Boulevard. In effect the residents were opposed to surface, trench, or elevated rail along much of Cambie Street. Even cut-and-cover construction raised concerns over construction impacts and temporary <b>traffic</b> <b>diversions.</b> Cost and ridership risks were also concerns to property tax-paying residents. Advertisements asked residents to join [...] "to prevent Vancouver's worst traffic nightmare and from burdening ourselves and our children with unnecessary tax risks for years to come". The society suggested that the line instead be constructed along Arbutus, where its impact and cost would be minimal. Despite the society's concerns, one of the final two proposals for the Canada Line in 2004 involved a trench in the center of Cambie Street from 49th to 64th Avenues.|$|R

50|$|The MMRDA {{announced}} that construction of viaducts would begin in April 2017. The agency had completed construction of piers on several {{sections of the}} corridor, and the viaducts will be built at locations where pier caps have been built. The first viaduct was constructed in the section between JVLR to Mahanand. Construction of all pier caps along the corridor will {{be completed by the}} end of 2017. The first U-girder, the concrete structure on which metro tracks are laid, was launched near Pathanwadi Junction in Malad on 2 May 2017. In total, Metro 7 required 1,400 U-girders. Work on erecting the U-girders, as well as disposal and dumping of muck generated from underground work is done only between 11:30 pm and 6:00 am. During this period, multi-axle trailers transport a U-girder weighing 170 tonne from the casting yard in Bandra to location where it is to be erected. The trailer must move slowly to avoid causing imbalance to the heavy load which can result in toppling, and takes roughly two hours to complete the journey. Lifting the girder and attaching it to the pier caps is also a difficult process and is carried out at night time. <b>Traffic</b> <b>diversions</b> are placed around the launching site to reduce the possibility of accidents. Officials erect an average of two girders every day.|$|R
