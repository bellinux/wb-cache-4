5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon.

5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion {{similar to those}} previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> at the time dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E

5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

His first guest on the programme was Bono. His RTÉ Radio 1 slot was filled by John Murray.

25|$|After much time, {{believed}} by Daniel Jackson to be thousands of years, the Alterans discovered the Milky Way, where they eventually built their empire. However, {{even after the}} Ori had forced the Alterans to leave their galaxy, the two factions remained bitter enemies. Eventually, the Alterans were afflicted with a terrible plague that wiped out most of their civilization. It would later be discovered <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> known of this plague {{is very similar to}} the disease used by Ori Priors against non-believers, which had led Daniel Jackson to speculate that the pre-Ascended Ori might have been responsible for this plague.|$|E
25|$|Oreostylidium subulatum was {{originally}} described by Sir William Jackson Hooker in 1864 as Stylidium subulatum in the related genus Stylidium. Hooker based his classification on imperfect floral specimens and thus {{had to rely}} upon fruit morphology and habitat similarities. Working from the fruit morphology alone, Hooker noticed his specimen resembled several members of Stylidium subgenus Tolypangium. In 1878, Ferdinand von Mueller proposed <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> known then as Stylidium subulatum be included within the related genus Phyllachne based on flower morphology. In the same year, Sven Berggren proposed the move that created the most accepted classification within the genus he created, Oreostylidium.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century as Chilean wines became more popular, wine tasters {{around the world}} began to doubt the {{authenticity}} of wines labeled Merlot and Sauvignon blanc. The wines lack many of the characteristics and typicity of those grapes. Ampelographers began to study the vines and found <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> considered Merlot was actually the ancient Bordeaux wine grape Carménère that {{was thought to be}} extinct. The Sauvignon blanc vines were found to actually be Sauvignonasse, also known as Sauvignon vert, or a mutated Sauvignon blanc/Sémillon cross. In response to these discoveries several Chilean wineries began to import true Merlot and Sauvignon blanc cuttings to where most bottles labeled Merlot and Sauvignon blanc from vintages in the 21st century {{are more likely to be}} those varieties.|$|E
