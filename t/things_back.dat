5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws <b>things</b> <b>back</b> at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put <b>things</b> <b>back</b> in their proper place, or Am careful to avoid making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put <b>things</b> <b>back</b> in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E
25|$|When Jefferson {{retired in}} 1809 he had {{accumulated}} many possessions while in Washington, {{which included a}} huge collection of books. Organizing and packing these things was a great task. Jefferson summoned Bacon to come to Washington with two servants to help him pack, load and supervise the transport of these <b>things</b> <b>back</b> to Monticello. Together they loaded about thirty crates which would {{be sent back to}} Monticello by water. The remaining items were loaded into three wagons which Bacon brought up from Monticello and along with the servants drove them back to Jefferson's estate, departing Washington on March ninth or tenth. Jefferson followed him on Saturday, the eleventh. Bacon later recalled the event in his memoirs.|$|E

25|$|The first ODI was hosted at Cape Town. South Africa were bundled out for 195, losing by 23 runs, and Pakistan {{taking the}} lead, 1–0. The 2nd ODI at Port Elizabeth was rain-affected, {{bringing}} {{it down to}} 45 overs per side. Pakistan won the game by 1 run, which also led them to a maiden series win against South Africa, that too at home. Pakistan {{was also the first}} South Asian team to beat South Africa in a bilateral ODI series at home. In the third ODI, Shehzad and 3 of Pakistan's star bowlers, Mohammad Hafeez, Shahid Afridi and Junaid Khan were rested. Batting first once again, Pakistan scraped together a total of 179 all out, with Misbah remaining unbeaten on 79. Although the bowlers tried to keep Pakistan in the game, the South African batsmen were too good and won by 4 wickets. Pakistan took the series 2–1. This away win over the Proteas after being humiliated in Pakistan's adopted home, the UAE, brought <b>things</b> <b>back</b> to normal in Pakistan cricket, with Misbah receiving praise from across the country.|$|E
500|$|The reappearance of Nick Lane and his storyline helped resolve {{an earlier}} plot point from [...] "Over There," [...] {{in which he}} was {{recognized}} by Fringe agent Lincoln Lee before dying. Noble noted that [...] "Worlds Apart' {{and the rest of the}} fourth season brought back a number of characters from the series' [...] "rich history", including Sally, Nick, and David Robert Jones. [...] "This episode," [...] he commented, [...] "is bringing those <b>things</b> <b>back</b> together for us as we face the decision of what to do. Do we keep the worlds together? How do we keep them together without creating the monster that is happening? How do we stop this monster from happening? That’s what this is all about." ...|$|E

[...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did <b>things</b> <b>back</b> in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion.

500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes <b>things</b> <b>back</b> to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Fonseca {{was drawn}} to Martinelli's [...] "funky personality", which {{differed}} from her much more serious previous role of Alexandra Udinov on Nikita. Fonseca and Atwell discussed keeping their characters as friends, rather than falling to [...] "jealousy or cattiness. There's nothing but just support and interest and friendship, {{because a lot of}} times it's more complicated than that on shows." [...] By July 2015, Fonseca was negotiating to return for the second season, and that December she was revealed to be returning for a dream sequence in [...] "A Little Song and Dance". Fazekas said that Angie's appearance in the sequence is her acting as Carter's conscience, [...] "speaking the things that Peggy maybe can’t say to herself. It ties <b>things</b> <b>back</b> together from the first season and it’s connecting all of these things in a way that only a dream can do." ...|$|E
500|$|Furtum was a delict of Roman law {{comparable}} to the modern offence of theft (as it is usually translated) despite being a civil and not criminal wrong. In the classical law and later, it denoted the contrectatio (“handling”) of most types of property with a particular sort of intention [...] fraud and in the later law, a view to gain. It is unclear whether a view to gain was always required or added later, and, if the latter, when. This meant that the owner did not consent, although Justinian broadened this {{in at least one}} case. The law of furtum protected a variety of property interests, but not land, things without an owner, or types of state or religious things. An owner could commit theft by taking his <b>things</b> <b>back</b> in certain circumstances, as could a borrower or similar user through misuse.|$|E

500|$|... "Green Light" [...] {{received}} positive reception from critics. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop {{referred to}} [...] "Green Light" [...] as a [...] "classic Pharrell-Neptunes groove". Andy Kellman of Allmusic described the track as an [...] "ambitious, fleet-footed number that continually switches tempos and sounds". Spence D. of IGN music stated, [...] "'Green Light' brings <b>things</b> <b>back</b> down to pseudo earthiness; {{both with the}} slightly more organic sounding Neptunes beat." [...] He felt that the [...] "rippling bassline sounds really familiar, like it's been used in other Neptunes' produced tracks before".... Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music said that [...] "Green Light" [...] is [...] "the best thing Pharrell and co have done in a long, long while." [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News Channel considered [...] "Green Light" [...] as his second choice as the song having the greatest potential to become a massive hit after [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2006). Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine gave a mixed review for the song commenting that it's one of the [...] "tired random-percussion tracks [...] that goes nowhere." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a {{contestant}} of {{the eleventh}} season of American Idol, covered [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] performing a slow-tempo ballad {{version of the}} song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, [...] "You did a beautiful job on it...If I was Beyoncé and I was home and I heard that, I'd be like 'I got {{to do that in}} my next concert, slow that one down.'" [...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled <b>things</b> <b>back,</b> and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks...And really, it was good enough".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} late March 2009, and {{finished}} {{on the end}} of July the same year. Director Martin Wood wanted to film the season in a more graphic novel style. Wood directed both parts of [...] "End of Nights", [...] "Hero", [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] and both parts of [...] "Kali". Brenton Spencer directed [...] "Eulogy", [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] and [...] "Penance". The producers felt that Spencer did [...] "a great job" [...] in making sense on a lot of moves he had to make, as well as understanding that the stories are important in getting <b>things</b> <b>back</b> on track in [...] "Eulogy". The episode ended up being 17 minutes longer than usual, so much of it had to be cut. Steven A. Adelson directed [...] "Fragments" [...] and [...] "Sleepers". Amanda Tapping directed [...] "Veritas", her first directorial credit since the Stargate SG-1 episode [...] "Resurrection" [...] in 2004. To direct the scenes featuring Magnus, Tapping rehearsed them to decide how it would be shot, then appointed somebody to handle the cameras. Peter DeLuise directed [...] "Haunted". Lee Wilson from Anthem Visual Effects directed a scene in [...] "Hero", while Robbins directed a scene from [...] "Fragments" [...] when his character recorded Rachel's documentary.|$|E

The impetus to bring <b>things</b> <b>back</b> to the city center included the construction of the new mayoral residence just off the Zócalo. The government has buried electric and telephone cables in the area, and replaced old asphalt with paving stones. It has also installed nearly 100security cameras to help with crime issues. This paved the way for the opening of upscale eateries, bars and fashionable stores. Also, young people are moving into downtown lofts. To attract more tourists, there are new red double-decker buses.|$|E
