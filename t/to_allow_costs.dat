40|$|Abstract — Researchers are {{applying}} more holistic {{approaches to the}} feedback control of the air transportation system. Many of these approaches rely on economic feedback, including the cost of delays to the airlines. Establishing an accurate mechanism for estimating {{the cost of a}} delays for each portion of a flight (gate costs, taxiing in and out costs, and en-route costs) is useful for many aspects of modeling airline behavior and for better understanding the likely impact of regulations. EuroControl (2004) developed a rigorous methodology and collected data for estimating the components of airline delay costs for various segments of a scheduled flight. The model, based on confidential information from European airlines for twelve types of aircraft circa 2003, was not transparent with regards to how each of the major components of cost (crew costs, fuel costs, maintenance, depreciation, etc) impacted that total. This paper describes the development of airline cost model, based on the Eurocontrol model. The airline cost model explicitly identifies the components of airline costs, is based on U. S. airline cost data, and includes 111 aircraft types. The new model is designed <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>costs</b> to be updated whenever any of the factors (e. g. crew, fuel, maintenance, and ground costs) change. It considers the type of the aircraft when making calculations, both from the perspective of fuel burn and passenger costs. A case-study analysis of airline costs of operation at 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the main challenges of using fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) in architectural applications. Architects are showing {{increased interest in}} the use of FRPs in modern buildings thanks to FRPs’ ability <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>cost</b> effective realization of unique shapes and flexible aesthetics, while accommodating architectural designs and needs. The long-term durability, weathering resistance, and the exceptional mechanical properties have recently suggested the adoption of FRPs for building façade systems in an increasing number of buildings worldwide. However, some challenges for a wider adoption of FRPs in buildings are represented by the environmental and thermal aspects of their production, as well as their resistance to the expected “fire loads”. This last aspect often raises many concerns, which often require expensive fire tests. In this paper, the results of cone calorimeter tests are compared with software simulations to evaluate the possibility of designing FRPs on the computer as opposed to current design practice that involves iterative use of fire testing. The comparison shows that pyrolysis simulations related to FRPs are still not an effective way to design fire safe FRPs for architectural applications...|$|R

The paper relates to the regulatory background of European Standard EN 762 and the need of a more detailed methodology to simulate urban flooding. The analysis of urban flooding caused by surcharged sewers in urban drainage systems leads to the necessity of a dual drainage modeling. A detailed dual drainage simulation model is described based upon hydraulic flow routing procedures for surface flow and pipe flow. Special consideration is given to the interaction between surface and sewer flow during surcharge conditions in order to most. accurately compute water levels above ground as a basis for further assessments of possible damage costs. The model application is presented for a small case study in terms of data needs, model verification and first simulation results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the stranded cost concept. Stranded costs {{have to do}} with the transition from a regulated to a more competitive market. The aim of the paper is threefold. First, the paper {{discusses the}} place of the stranded cost concept in the variety of costs concepts encountered in the economic literature. In order to come to a proper description of stranded costs, we first define a new concept, i. e. strandable costs. These are the fixed or sunk costs to be paid by the incumbents that have been imposed by the regulator. Strandable costs become stranded when they cannot be recovered through the market after the introduction of competition. Second, we argue on the basis of a simple graphical analysis that from the point of view of economic efficiency, there is no need <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for stranded <b>cost</b> recovery. Third, this view is illustrated with some numerical simulations, based on the Belgian electricity sector. These simulations suggest that, according to the assumptions and to the definition of stranded costs in our model, there will be no stranded costs for the Belgian electricity producers. A fortiori, the conclusion is that there is no need <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for stranded <b>cost</b> recovery. However, the simulations go one step further and assume that for one reason or another strandable <b>cost</b> recovery is <b>allowed</b> through a tax on electricity transmission. Keywords...|$|R
