5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave. The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of <b>the</b> <b>palate.</b> The back margin of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> {{between the}} incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. <b>The</b> <b>palate</b> itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on <b>the</b> <b>palate.</b> The back margin of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the back margin, as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has the back margin U-shaped instead and has a longer palate, with the back margin behind the M3s.|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{comparing}} the skulls of some Triassic dicynodonts with Permian {{members of the}} family, {{it was noted that}} the interpterygoid space in the former is consistently smaller than in the latter (Cruickshank 1965 : 1967). In analysing this difference further, <b>the</b> <b>palates</b> of a series of Permian and Triassic dicynodonts were examined, either directly or from published diagrams.

5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> {{between the}} incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>palate.</b> The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> during articulation. A picture is then taken of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, {{it can be difficult}} to collect large amounts of data.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to re-evaluate the {{classical}} description of fusion as the closure mechanism of both the hard and soft palates in normal human embryos. Does <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> develop by a posterior continuation of shelf apposition, epithelial lamination and disintegration, and by mesenchymal cell fusion as described for <b>the</b> hard <b>palate?</b> Or does <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> develop by proliferation and migration of subepithelial mesenchymal growth centers at the posterior edge of <b>the</b> fused hard <b>palate</b> so that <b>the</b> early furrow which separates the two primordial processes of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> is progressively obliterated by mesenchymal merging at the furrow base? Observations of human embryos prior to, during, and after palatal closure (7 – 12 wks, 18 – 75 mm C-R length) indicated (1) an anteroposterior gradient of palatal closure beginning at <b>the</b> primary <b>palate</b> and (2) epithelial fusion remnants found only in <b>the</b> hard <b>palate</b> regions. These observations suggest that <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> develops by a displacement of epithelium by mesenchymal merging rather than by epithelial fusion of the entire secondary palatine processes...|$|R
50|$|Around the 5th week, the intermaxillary segment arises as {{a result}} of fusion of the two medial nasal {{processes}} and the frontonasal process within the embryo. The intermaxillary segment give rise to <b>the</b> primary <b>palate.</b> <b>The</b> primary <b>palate</b> will form <b>the</b> premaxillary portion of the maxilla (anterior one-third of <b>the</b> final <b>palate).</b> This small portion is anterior to the incisive foramen and will contain the maxillary incisors.|$|R
50|$|In human embryology, {{it refers}} to that portion of <b>the</b> hard <b>palate</b> that is formed by {{the growth of the}} two palatine shelves medially and their mutual fusion in the midline. It forms the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> adult <b>palate</b> and meets <b>the</b> primary <b>palate</b> at <b>the</b> incisive foramen.|$|R
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of <b>the</b> <b>palate.</b> A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The diastema (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The bony palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except {{for a pair of}} foramina (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> is {{at the level of the}} middle of the third molars (M3). In the bony roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, is reduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> soft <b>palate</b> (also {{known as}} the velum or muscular palate) is, in mammals, the soft tissue constituting {{the back of the}} roof of the mouth. <b>The</b> soft <b>palate</b> is {{distinguished}} from <b>the</b> hard <b>palate</b> at <b>the</b> front of the mouth in that it does not contain bone.|$|R
50|$|It can {{be found}} in the midline of <b>the</b> hard <b>palate,</b> <b>the</b> palatine raphe, among other places.|$|R
25|$|Submucous {{cleft palate}} (SMCP) can also occur, {{which is a}} cleft of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> with a classic {{clinical}} triad of a bifid, or split, uvula which is found dangling {{in the back of}} the throat, a furrow along the midline of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate,</b> and a notch in the back margin of <b>the</b> hard <b>palate.</b>|$|R
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> reach backward between the molars. <b>The</b> <b>palate</b> is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities, which are set far to the front. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, {{an opening in the}} back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. Some openings occur in the mastoid bone.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the front}} part of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> do not extend between the molars. <b>The</b> <b>palate</b> ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of}} the mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the mastoid bone lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T.talamancae. The pattern of the arteries in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various foramina (openings) and grooves in the skull.|$|E
50|$|A {{custom-made}} artificial palate is moulded to fit {{against a}} speaker's hard <b>palate.</b> <b>The</b> artificial <b>palate</b> contains electrodes {{exposed to the}} lingual surface.

40|$|An 11 -year-old {{neutered}} male boxer {{was presented}} {{for treatment of}} a multilobular osteochondroma of <b>the</b> hard <b>palate.</b> <b>The</b> mass was surgically resected and <b>the</b> hard <b>palate</b> defect was reconstructed using an angularis oris axial pattern buccal mucosal flap. No local recurrence was reported 6 mo after surgery...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of <b>the</b> secondary <b>palate</b> commences in <b>the</b> sixth week of human embryological development. It is characterised by {{the formation of}} two palatal shelves on the maxillary prominences, the elevation of these shelves to a horizontal position, and then a process of palatal fusion between the horizontal shelves. The shelves will also fuse anteriorly upon <b>the</b> primary <b>palate,</b> with <b>the</b> incisive foramen being the landmark between <b>the</b> primary <b>palate</b> and secondary palate. This forms {{what is known as}} the roof of the mouth, or <b>the</b> hard <b>palate.</b>|$|R
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> {{between the}} incisors and the molars, are short {{and do not}} reach near the first molars; they are longer in T.hylophilus. They are widest where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. <b>The</b> <b>palate</b> itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple posterolateral palatal pits {{at the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> near the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening located behind the end of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid strut separates two foramina (openings) {{at the base of the}} skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of T.ucucha follows the primitive pattern. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, overlaps the suspensory process of the squamosal bone. At the back of the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process to receive the root of the lower incisor, which is absent in T.hylophilus.|$|E
5|$|The interorbital {{region is}} 4.14mm {{long and the}} {{zygomatic}} plate is 2.38mm. The diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars is 6.39mm long. The incisive foramina are 5.25mm long and 1.77mm broad. The palatal bridge (the portion of <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> between the incisive foramina and the mesopterygoid fossa behind {{the back end of}} <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> is 4.29mm long and 2.75mm broad at the first molars. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long and M1 is 1.19mm broad. These measurements make J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the front part of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> are very broad and extend between the first molars. The zygomatic plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. <b>The</b> <b>palate</b> itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the end of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: <b>The</b> soft <b>palate</b> is {{composed}} of several muscles. So far, these muscles have been analyzed sepa-rately and the whole structure of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> has been described very vaguely. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the structure of soft palate collectively. Study Design: Human cadaver dissection. Methods: Anatomical dissection was performed on 20 Korean, formalin-fixed cadavers (13 men and 7 women). The heads were randomly assigned to either dissection groups, medial-to-lateral (10 heads) or posterior-to-anterior (10 heads). Results: Fibro-fatty layer was located in the oral side of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate</b> and became thick and dense along the midline. The levator veli palatini was distributed on the nasal side of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate.</b> <b>The</b> average vertical distance from the top of pal-atopharyngeal arch to the levator veli palatini was 12. 36 5. 2 mm. The palatopharyngeus was also spread out widely and filled the palatopharyngeal arch. The periosteum of <b>the</b> hard <b>palate</b> became <b>the</b> fascia of <b>the</b> soft <b>palate,</b> which was merged with the aponeurosis of the tensor veli palatini in the midline. The Passavant’s ridge was located between the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus, inserting onto the aponeurosis. The palatoglossus was very thin and embedded in the palato-glossal arch.

5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is broad. The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of <b>the</b> <b>palate)</b> extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, {{the upper and lower}} first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of <b>the</b> <b>palate,</b> extend to a point between the first molars, and <b>the</b> <b>palate</b> is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} zygomatic arches (cheekbones).
