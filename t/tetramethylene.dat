These compounds were found to be thermally stable to 150 °C and did not initiate polymerization in styrene, methyl methacrylate, a series of high boiling acrylates, and dimethyl fumarate. Free radicals were trapped in dimethyl fumarate to give oligomers at temperatures above 110 °C. Even though the compounds studied did not initiate polymerization at decomposition temperatures of 175 °- 200 °C, dimethyl fumarate may prove useful in these studies in the future...|$|R

5000|$|Phosphonates are {{effective}} chelating agents. That is, they bind tightly to di- and trivalent metal ions, which {{is useful in}} water softening. In this way, they prevent formation of insoluble precipitates (scale). The binding of these ligands also suppresses the catalytic properties of metal ions. They are stable under harsh conditions. For these reasons, an important industrial use of phosphonates is in cooling waters, desalination systems, and in oil fields to inhibit scale formation. Phosphonates are also regularly used in reverse osmosis systems as anti-scalants. Phosphonates in cooling water systems also serve to control corrosion of iron and steel. In pulp and paper manufacturing and in textile industry they serve as [...] "peroxide bleach stabilizers", by chelating metals that could inactivate the peroxide. In detergents they are used as a combination of chelating agent, scale inhibitor, and bleach stabilizer. Phosphonates are also increasingly used in medicine to treat disorders associated with bone formation and calcium metabolism. Furthermore, they serve as carriers for radionuclides in bone cancer treatments (see samarium-153-ethylene diamine <b>tetramethylene</b> phosphonate).|$|E

40|$|The {{reactions}} of five trihalomethyl group substituted electron-deficient olefins with electron-rich olefins were studied {{in order to}} determine the effect of steric bulk upon the subsequent {{reactions of}} the <b>tetramethylene</b> intermediates initially formed. Reactions of β-trihalomethyl group substituted olefins yielded cyclobutane adducts, resulting from a gem dimethyl effect which accelerates the collapse of the <b>tetramethylene</b> intermediate. Reactions of α-trihalomethyl group substituted olefins gave both small molecule and polymeric products. Polymers were produced in reactions where steric interactions between the termini of the <b>tetramethylene</b> intermediates prevented ring formation. Ester substituted electron-deficient olefins reacted with electron-rich olefins to give both cyclobutane and 6 -alkoxy- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-pyran derivatives. A transition from concerted to stepwise reaction was observed, resulting from steric hindrance in the transition state leading to [4 + 2] cycloaddition.

40|$|Abstract [...] Infrared spectra (4000 - 1200 cm- 1) were {{obtained}} for several homoionic montmorillonite films on which <b>tetramethylene</b> sulfoxide (TMSO) or thiolane were adsorbed at various temperatures and for different periods of exposure. The spectra indicate that he Na-, H-, and natural montmorillonite complexes contain aphysically adsorbed species, whereas transition metal-montmorillonite complexes contain both physically adsorbed and metal-complexed species in their interlamellar spaces. Apparently, thiolane ad-sorbed on most montmorillonites undergoes oxidation to TMSO in an air atmosphere. Consistent with the mechanism proposed earlier for aqueous olutions, the rate of sulfoxide formation increases by increasing the pH of the suspensions from which the clay films were deposited or by increasing the concentration f the water molecules in the interlamellar spaces. The infrared spectra of y-thiolactone adsorbed on Co-montmorillonites suggest that sulfoxide-type molecules are formed which chelate to the Co ions in the interlamellar spaces.

40|$|A non-isocyanate route (NIR) {{of making}} polyureas of high {{molecular}} weight has been found through transureation of N,N'-diphenyl- 4, 4 '-methylenediphenylene biscarbamate (4, 4 '-DP-MDC) {{with a variety of}} diamines and mixed diamines. The preparation of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC was achieved readily by carbonylation of 4, 4 '-methylenedianiline (4, 4 '-MDA) with diphenyl carbonate (DPC) using organic acids as catalysts. It was found that the highest yield (99 %) of pure 4, 4 '-DP-MDC can be isolated in a toluene solution under mild conditions co-catalyzed by benzoic acid and tertiary amine. Trans-ureation of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC with aliphatic amines indicated that the process is a highly solvent dependent process and was found to be extremely facile in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 80 C and in <b>tetramethylene</b> sulfone (TMS) at 140 C in absence of any catalyst. Particularly, the most effective polymerization process was developed using <b>tetramethylene</b> sulfone (TMS) as the solvent under reduced pressure for concurrently distilling off phenol from the reaction mixture during the polymerization in a shifting equilibrium towards polyurea. However, this solvent-assisted transureation was found to be in-efficient when N, N'-dimethyl- 4, 4 '- methylenediphenylene biscarbamate (4, 4 '-DM-MDC) was used in a similar condition for comparison. Thus, an efficient green-chemistry process has been developed based on 4, 4 '-DP-MDC in making urea prepolymers, urea elastomers and urea plastics all in excellent yields without using reactive methylenediphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) or any catalysts in the trans-ureation polymerizations...|$|E

Pyrolysis behaviors of the intermediates indicated the conversion pathways, and the conversion: levoglucosenone → furfural was found to require water. The control of the water content in the pyrolysis medium was quite effective in controlling the product selectivity between levoglucosenone and furfural: mild vacuum conditions to remove the product water dramatically enhanced the levoglucosenone yield, while steam distillation conditions increased the furfural and 5 -HMF yields.|$|E

The observation that the preformed reaction products of either of the fungicides with thioglycollic acid are almost non-toxic is strong evidence for this hypothesis.

40|$|A {{series of}} bis-[(m-hydroxyphenyl) trimethylammonium iodide] esters of polymethylenedicarbamic acids {{and a number}} of (m-hydroxyphenyl) trimethylammonium iodide esters of {{straight-chain}} N-alkylcarbamic acids have been examined as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase from fly head. Evidence is presented suggesting that inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the bis-carbamates is due to carbamoylation of the enzyme, as is generally thought to be the case with esters of N-alkylcarbamic acids. Inhibition is irreversible. The (m-hydroxyphenyl) trimethylammonium iodide ester of N-hexylcarbamic acid also inhibits fly head acetylcholinesterase irreversibly. There is therefore no need to implicate a second functional group in bis-carbamate esters to explain the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. An unusual feature of the inhibition is that inhibition lines do not pass through 100 % enzyme activity at t= 0, except for rather low concentrations of inhibitor (< 10 μm for the octamethylene compound). Also, inhibition lines tend towards a maximum slope as inhibitor concentration is increased. The first observation indicates complex-formation, even in the presence of high concentrations of substrate, and by using measurements of inhibition at relatively high inhibitor concentrations, affinity constants K′a have been calculated. K′a varies from 0. 1 μm for the dodecamethylene compound to 10 μm for the <b>tetramethylene</b> compound, in the presence of 3. 75 mm-acetylthiocholine, indicating high affinity for the enzyme. The second observation shows that, owing to this high affinity, the enzyme becomes saturated with inhibitor under the experimental conditions employed, and from the limiting slope values of the carbamoylation rate constant (k 2) have been calculated. k 2 varies from 0. 15 min− 1 for the <b>tetramethylene</b> compound to 1 min− 1 for the decamethylene compound. Variations of potency in this series are therefore mainly due to changes in affinity (100 -fold) rather than in carbamoylation rate (sevenfold). The observation that large molecules may acylate the enzyme raises certain problems, which are discussed...|$|E
