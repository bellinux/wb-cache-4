40|$|Dynamic typing is an {{important}} feature of dynamic programming languages. Primitive operators such as those for performing arithmetic and comparisons typically operate {{on a wide variety}} of in put value types, and as such, must internally implement some form of dynamic type dispatch and type checking. Removing such <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> is important for an efficient implementation. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of a novel approach to reducing the number of dynamically executed <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> called context-driven basic block versioning. This simple technique clones and specializes basic blocks in such a way as to allow the compiler to accumulate type information while machine code is generated, without a separate type analysis pass. The accumulated information allows the removal of some redundant <b>type</b> <b>tests,</b> particularly in performance-critical paths. We have implemented intraprocedural context-driven basic block versioning in a JavaScript JIT compiler. For comparison, we have also implemented a classical flow-based type analysis operating on the same concrete types. Our results show that basic block versioning performs better on most benchmarks and removes a large fraction of <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> at the expense of a moderate code size increase. We believe that this technique offers a good tradeoff between implementation complexity and performance, and is suitable for integration in production JIT compilers.

40|$|Abstract—Data {{analysis}} is a quite important process {{and has been}} extensively employed in many areas.

This paper presents that linear regression {{as a type of}} universal method {{can be applied to the}} distribution <b>type</b> <b>test.</b> In reliability engineering due to the failure data is commonly of non-linear relationship so that the linear regression method can not be directly employed. This difficulty can be resolved through linear transformation. Aimed for the linearization procedure of four kind of typical distributions, e. g., exponential distribution, normal distribution, logarithmic normal distribution and two-parameter Weibull distribution, their transformations are respectively different. After linearization transformations, correlation coefficients had been used as a criterion to choose the most matched distribution type. This method can be conveniently operated in MS EXCEL. Several samples and experiments illustrated the detailed transformation and the efficiency than other methods.

40|$|Abstract Background Relative {{survival}} analysis is a subfield of {{survival analysis}} where competing risks data are observed, but the causes of death are unknown. A {{first step in the}} analysis of such data is usually the estimation of a net survival curve, possibly followed by regression modelling. Recently, a log-rank <b>type</b> <b>test</b> for comparison of net survival curves has been introduced and the goal {{of this paper is to}} explore its properties and put this methodological advance into the context of the field. Methods We build on the association between the log-rank test and the univariate or stratified Cox model and show the analogy in the relative survival setting. We study the properties of the methods using both the theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We provide an R function to enable practical usage of the log-rank <b>type</b> <b>test.</b> Results Both the log-rank <b>type</b> <b>test</b> and its model alternatives perform satisfactory under the null, even if the correlation between their p-values is rather low, implying that both approaches cannot be used simultaneously. The stratified version has a higher power in case of non-homogeneous hazards, but also carries a different interpretation. Conclusions The log-rank <b>type</b> <b>test</b> and its stratified version can be interpreted in the same way as the results of an analogous semi-parametric additive regression model despite the fact that no direct theoretical link can be established between the test statistics...|$|R
