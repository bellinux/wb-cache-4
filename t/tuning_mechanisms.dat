25|$|The medieval European timpani were {{typically}} {{put together by}} hand in the southern region of France. Some drums were tightened together by horses tugging from {{each side of the}} drum by the bolts. Over the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop that was tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch. The Industrial Revolution enabled the introduction of new construction techniques and materials, in particular machine and pedal <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Plastic heads were introduced in the mid-20th century, led by Remo.|$|E
2500|$|One of Paul's {{innovations}} became somewhat successful; unfortunately, {{it was not}} to his benefit. In the mid-1940s, {{he introduced}} an aluminum guitar with the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> below the bridge. As it had no headstock, only string attachments at the nut, it was the first [...] "headless" [...] guitar. Unfortunately, Paul's guitar was so sensitive to the heat from stage lights that it would not keep tune. This style was further developed by others, most successfully Ned Steinberger.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Hans Schnellar, the timpanist of the Vienna Philharmonic, {{developed}} a <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in which the}} bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base and the head remains stationary. These instruments {{are referred to as}} Viennese timpani (Wiener Pauken) or Schnellar timpani. Adams Musical Instruments developed a pedal-operated version of this <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the early 21st century.|$|R

50|$|A {{tailpiece}} is {{a component}} on many stringed musical instruments that anchors {{one end of}} the strings, usually opposite the end with the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> (the scroll, headstock, peghead, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Originally, all guitars {{were made}} with wooden tuning pegs, that pass {{straight}} through the headstock, {{similar to those found}} on a lute, a violin or oud, as opposed to the modern classical-style guitars' geared <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|E
50|$|Professional bassists {{are more}} likely to have {{adjustable}} bridges, which have a metal screw mechanism. This enables the bassist to raise or lower the height of the strings to accommodate changing humidity or temperature conditions. The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental tuning pegs projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.|$|E

25|$|A rare <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{allows the}} pitch {{to be changed}} by {{rotating}} the drum itself. A similar system is used on rototoms. Jenco, a company better known for mallet percussion, made timpani tuned in this fashion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a self powered control system that autonomously adapts the resonant frequency of an electromagnetic vibration-based energy harvester. The <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> adjusts the harvester’s spring stiffness by varying the axial tensile force between two permanent magnets. The system can adjust the resonant frequency of the harvester from 64 to 78 Hz, increasing the operational bandwidth of the harvester from 0. 26 to 14 Hz, using a single structure. A closed loop control measures the ambient frequency using the phase difference between the harvester output voltage and an accelerometer to adjust the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The system has a maximum energy consumption of 202 mJ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} tuning tool {{is called a}} [...] "tuning knife". It {{is a piece of}} metal used to tap gently on the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a pipe, so as to avoid {{touching}} the pipe with the hands.|$|R
50|$|After {{another month}} of {{repairing}} and replacing parts, testing and <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the project {{got the first}} solid result that the tapes were good. Each tape starts with a short standard-format audio clip of the operator, and the tape drives were {{able to read the}} audio signal. (Hear a sample of the audio.) This does not use the video heads that are needed to read the Lunar Orbiter data off the tape, but this demonstrated that the tapes had not deteriorated and that many of the sub-systems of the tape drive were in good working order.|$|E
50|$|A tuned radio {{frequency}} receiver (or TRF receiver) {{is a type}} of radio receiver that is composed of one or more tuned {{radio frequency}} (RF) amplifier stages followed by a detector (demodulator) circuit to extract the audio signal and usually an audio frequency amplifier. This type of receiver was popular in the 1920s. Early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station's frequency, but later models had ganged tuning, the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of all stages being linked together, and operated by just one control knob. By the mid 1930s, it was replaced by the superheterodyne receiver patented by Edwin Armstrong.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{instrument}} makers and performers began {{to revive the}} çeng, with newer designs incorporating advanced <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as those found on the kanun. Tone bending is also possible, by pressing on the string behind the bridge. Whereas the soundbox on the old çeng was on {{the upper part of}} the instrument, modern instruments have the soundbox on the lower part. [...] In 1995, Fikret Karakaya, a kemençe player from Turkey, made a çeng using the descriptions in the masnavi [...] "Çengname" [...] by the Turkish poet Ahmed-i Dai, and from Iranian and Ottoman miniatures from the 15th and 16th centuries. He presently plays and records with the instrument.|$|E

50|$|Worm drives {{are used}} as the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> for many musical instruments, {{including}} guitars, double-basses, mandolins, bouzoukis, and many banjos (although most high-end banjos use planetary gears or friction pegs). A worm drive tuning device is called a machine head.|$|R
25|$|Blowing more softly {{lowers the}} pitch; blowing harder raises it. Breath force {{can change the}} pitch by three semitones. This is why ocarinas {{generally}} have no <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> or dynamic range, and why {{it is hard to}} learn to play one in tune.|$|R
5000|$|Paul {{continued}} to seek technical improvements, {{although they were}} not always successful commercially. For example, in 1962 Paul was issued US Patent No. 3,018,680, for a pickup in which the coil was physically attached to the strings. One of Paul's innovations became somewhat successful; unfortunately, {{it was not to}} his benefit. In the mid-1940s, he introduced an aluminum guitar with the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> below the bridge.

50|$|Created by Robert Grawi {{to satisfy}} {{the need for an}} {{instrument}} easier to play polyrhythms on than the guitar, its design evolved over several years. During 1973-74 the first model made was acoustic having a bamboo and fiberglass basket resonator with animal skin head and large bamboo neck. Although taking inspiration from the West African kora, these first gravikords already differed from the kora by having the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> removed from the neck and placed at the base, and an extensively re-designed bridge which also featured a kalimba incorporated into it that could be played simultaneously with the strings. Its tuning also differed from the kora as it had 25 strings that were tuned symmetrically using a variation of the Hugh Tracey kalimba tuning system as a basis that he thought would be more open to western musicians. Several one of a kind prototypes were also created during this period using wood, aluminum, and other materials, also having different features including stereo output and variable pitch.|$|E
40|$|Large {{spectral}} tuning of a water–glycerol microdroplet {{standing on}} a superhydrophobic surface by local heating with a focused infrared laser is studied both experimentally by optical spectroscopy and computationally using a lumped system formulation of the mass and heat transfer between the microdroplet and the chamber. The effects of optical scattering force, chamber humidity, size of microdroplet and laser power on the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> are examined. The reversibility of the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also studied. In spite of its negligibly small volatility {{compared to that of}} water, irreversibility is found to be mainly caused by evaporation of glycerol. It is also found that reversibility increases dramatically with the relative water and glycerol humidities, and spectral tuning can be made almost fully reversible when the chamber is saturated with glycerol vapor and the relative water humidity approaches unity. Some hysteresis effects are observed, especially in large microdroplets, and this behavior is attributed to the whispering-gallery mode resonances in laser absorption. The time response of the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also analyzed both experimentally and computationally. The technique presented can find applications in optical communication systems, and can be used in fundamental studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics and in characterizing liquid aerosols on a surface.

50|$|The {{pitch of}} a vessel flute is {{affected}} by how hard the player blows. Breath force can change the pitch by three semitones. This is why vessel flutes generally have no <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and why {{it is hard to}} learn to play a vessel flute in tune.|$|R
40|$|We used a noise-masking {{paradigm}} {{to investigate}} the number and properties of chromatic mechanisms involved in image segmentation. Observers were presented with a pattern of dynamic random squares, each independently modulated along a certain direction in DKL color space, either in the isoluminant plane or in the L j M luminance plane. A signal consisting of a rectangular region of squares, oriented horizontally or vertically, {{was added to the}} noise. The signal squares were spatially and temporally aligned to the noise squares, excluding the possibility of phase offsets to mediate segmentation performance. Noise and signal color directions were independently varied, and the signal contrast was measured at which an observer could reliably indicate the orientation of the signal. In a second set of experiments, the noise was simultaneously varying in two directions, symmetrically arranged around the signal direction. Masking was generally highest when signal and noise were modulated along the same direction and minimal for orthogonal noise. No difference was found between signals modulated along cardinal directions or intermediate directions. However, measured tuning widths critically depended on the type of noise: Noise modulated along one direction results in narrow tuning, whereas two-sided noise results in broad tuning. A chromatic detection model with multiple broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> successfully accounts for the experimental findings, both for narrow and broad tuning curves. Models with four broadly <b>tuned</b> cardinal <b>mechanisms</b> or multiple narrowly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> failed to reproduce the data. Our results suggest an important role for multiple, broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in image segmentation...|$|R
5000|$|Social {{penetration}} {{theory is}} based on four basic assumptions. First, relationship development moves from superficial layers to intimate ones. For instance, on a first date, people tend to present their outer images only, talking about hobbies. As the relational development progresses, wider and more controversial topics such as political views {{are included in the}} conversations. Second, interpersonal relationships develop in a generally systematic and predictable manner. This assumption indicates the predictability of relationship development. Although it is impossible to foresee the exact and precise path of relational development, there is certain trajectory to follow. As Altman and Taylor note, [...] "People seem to possess very sensitive <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which enable them to program carefully their interpersonal relationships." [...] Third, relational development could move backward, resulting in de-penetration and dissolution. For example, after prolonged and fierce fights, a couple who originally planned to get married may decide to break up and turn to be strangers ultimately. Fourth, self-disclosure is the key to facilitate relationship development. Self-disclosure means disclosing and sharing personal information to others. It enables individuals to know each other and plays a crucial role in determining how far a relationship can go, because gradual exploration of mutual selves is essential in the process of social penetration.|$|E
40|$|Networks of {{signaling}} pathways perform complex temporal decoding {{functions in}} diverse biological systems, including the synapse, development, and bacterial chemotaxis. This paper examines temporal filtering and tuning properties of synaptic signaling pathways {{as a possible}} substrate for emergent temporal decoding. A mass action kinetic model of 16 synaptic signaling pathways was used to dissect out the contribution of these pathways in linear cascades and when coupled to form a network. The model predicts two primary mechanisms of temporal tuning of pathways: a weighted summation of responses of pathways with different timings {{and the presence of}} biochemical feedback loop(s) with emergent dynamics. Regulatory inputs act differently on these two <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In the first case, regulators act like a gain-control on pathways with different intrinsic tuning. In the case of feedback loops, the temporal properties of the loop itself are changed. These basic <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may underlie specialized temporal tuning functions in more complex signaling systems in biology...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{to provide an}} adjustable virtual pivot for MEMS tunable lasers, which eliminates the mode hopping problem associated with conventional Littrow lasers. The key idea is to attach the two ends of the blazed grating to two separate translational actuators.

As a result, the wavelength can be continuously tuned ideally over an unlimited range through a simultaneous sweep of the grating angle and cavity length. In the experiments, a MEMS Littrow laser is fabricated by the DRIE process on the SOI wafer and is integrated onto a single chip with the size of 3 mm × 3 mm.
