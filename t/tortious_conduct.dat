Defendants' motions, however, raise issues that the Court is obliged to address before it can consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims.

But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by Mr. Wilson against the Bush Administration's handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials. Thus, the alleged <b>tortious</b> <b>conduct,</b> namely the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's status as a covert operative, was incidental to the kind of conduct that defendants were employed to perform.|$|E
2500|$|The but-for test is factual {{causation}} {{and often}} {{gives us the}} right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. [...] Two difficulties are immediately obvious. [...] The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. [...] But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant <b>tortious</b> <b>conduct</b> would not have occurred. [...] But for {{the victim of a}} crime missing the bus, he or she would not have been {{at the site of the}} crime and hence the crime would not have occurred. [...] Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm.

Of course, sovereign equality has diminished in general as human rights have grown, but even as nation-states accept treaty-based obligations toward their own citizens, they refuse to make themselves explicitly accountable in the national courts of other countries and usually refuse to hold other states accountable in their own courts. Immunity often remains the stylized equalizer...|$|R
40|$|The Packers and Stockyards Act {{was enacted}} in 1921. Congress was plainly {{influenced}} by the 1919 publication of a Federal Trade Commission Report on the meatpacking industry. Consistent with the FTC’s jurisdiction and concerns, the Report dealt with deceptive and unfair practices as well as practices that were believed to violate the antitrust laws. The language of the PSA does much the same, mixing the two. Of its seven specific prohibitions, three contain antitrust-like provisions requiring a lessening of competition. Two others reach unfair and tort-like conduct without any requirement of harm to competition. The remaining two reach both anticompetitive and tortuous conspiracies. One of the conspiracy provisions plainly reaches price fixing and market division agreements. The other plainly reaches {{a full range of}} <b>tortious</b> and anticompetitive <b>conduct</b> without stating a harm to competition requirement. This brief essay considers the wisdom of holdings in half a dozen Circuit Courts of Appeal that even those sections of the statute that do not explicitly require harm to competition must be interpreted as if they did...|$|R
40|$|Not long ago, American {{tort law}} clearly {{rejected}} an "outlaw" doctrine: a plaintiff engaged in tortious or criminal acts was not {{treated as an}} outlaw who could be injured with impunity. The plaintiff's unlawful conduct might {{give rise to a}} defense such as contributory or comparative negligence under ordinary tort prlnciples, or might trigger a privilege assertable against the plaintiff. However, unlawful conduct, by itself, did not inevitably bar the courthouse doors. The second Restatement's rejection of a rule making <b>tortious</b> or criminal <b>conduct</b> an absolute obstacle to recovery in tort was not surprising. Much has changed in American tort law during the past thirty years, including the rules relating to unlawful conduct. There are questions as to how far the unlawful conduct defense extends. Courts are in disagreement as to both the requirements of the unlawful conduct defense and whether the plaintiff or the defendant bears the burden of proof. It makes a world of difference, both to the individual litigant and to the fairness of the justice system, whether unlawful conduct is treated as an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof, versus an aspect of proximate causation that precludes a plaintiff from establishing a prima facie case...|$|R

5000|$|The Fourth Circuit {{agreed with}} the {{district}} court finding that although by its terms Oklahoma state law {{was not limited to}} material misrepresentations, it was preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act in the case of immaterial misrepresentations. This was so because the CAN-SPAM exception allows states to punish only [...] "falsity and deception" [...] in commercial emails. The Court held that although the terms [...] "falsity and deception" [...] have not been defined in the CAN-SPAM Act, common meaning of these words indicates that the CAN-SPAM exception is applicable only to material misrepresentation. The court explained that [...] "deception" [...] requires more than bare error. While [...] "falsity" [...] may be defined as not being true it also conveys a sense of tortiuousness and wrongfulness. The word [...] "falsity" [...] when read in combination with [...] "deception" [...] indicates traditionally <b>tortious</b> or wrongful <b>conduct.</b> Thus, Congress would not have intended [...] "falsity" [...] to mean simply an error. Adopting such a meaning would also defeat the very purpose of the CAN-SPAM Act which is to ensure a careful balance between preserving a potentially useful commercial tool (electronic communication) and preventing its abuse. According to the court, Mummagraphics’ reading of the [...] "falsity or deception" [...] exception would permit this exception to swallow the whole rule, giving states more power than intended and undermining the regulatory balance that Congress established. Accordingly, Mummagraphics’ broad reading of the exception was not compatible with the structure of the CAN-SPAM Act as a whole.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the general tort law governing liability for torts committed by others and compares it {{to the law of}} indirect infringement for patents, copyrights, and trademarks. There are a number of circumstances in which the law imposes liability for torts committed by other persons. Liability is imposed on an aider and abettor who gives substantial assistance or encouragement to another person’s commission of a tort, provided the aider and abettor actually knows the other person’s <b>conduct</b> is <b>tortious.</b> Liability is also imposed on a party who induces another person to commit a tort if the inducer either knows or should know of circumstances that would make the <b>conduct</b> <b>tortious.</b> In addition, liability is imposed on a party who permits another person to commit torts on the party’s premises or with the party’s instrumentalities if the party knows the other person is acting or will act tortiously. The law of indirect infringement for patents, copyrights, and trademarks originally developed out of the general tort law, but it has diverged from the general tort law in various ways. Since direct infringement is a statutory tort, liability should not be imposed for indirect infringement when the general tort law would not impose liability for other types of torts committed by other persons, unless there are sound reasons for treating infringement differently than other types of torts. Consequently, the general tort law may provide insight as to how unsettled issues in the law of indirect infringement should be resolved. In addition, identifying differences between the general tort law principles and the law of indirect infringement reveals questionable case law that should be reexamined...|$|R

50|$|Amongst unintentional torts {{one finds}} {{negligence}} {{as being the}} most common source of common law. Most Americans are {{under the impression that}} most people can sue for any type of negligence, but it is untrue in most US jurisdictions (partly because negligence {{is one of the few}} torts for which ordinary people can and do obtain liability insurance.) It is a form of extracontractual liability that is based upon a failure to comply with the duty of care of a reasonable person, which failure is the actual cause and proximate cause of damages.

50|$|As it has developed, {{the law of}} unjust {{enrichment}} has frequently {{been referred to as}} the 'law of restitution'. The difficulty with this is that it emphasises a legal response (restitution) rather than the event which gives rise to it ({{unjust enrichment}}). In doing so, it is akin to treating contract (an event which gives rise to an obligation to perform) as coterminous with compensation (the law's response to non-performance or defective performance). That approach is problematic: the law of compensation is wider than contract, encompassing compensation claims arising out of <b>tortious</b> <b>conduct.</b> This is equally true of restitution: a claimant can obtain restitution not only for an unjust enrichment, but also for a tort. It is in this sense that one can say that restitution is multi-causal: it is a legal response to a number of different events.|$|E

5000|$|Wallace Kirkpatrick, an {{official}} of the Antitrust Division, writing shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in the FOGA case, pointed out the difference between Learned Hand's and Justice Black's respective approaches to boycotts against wrongdoers—persons committing criminal or tortious acts. Judge Hand held that a boycott may be justified by the conduct of the person against whom the boycott is directed, even where the boycott was not a refusal to participate in unlawful acts. For instance, he said, it was justifiable for dress manufacturers to boycott retailers who got access to unpublished designs by a crime or a breach of contract, or whoknowingly bought from a manufacturer who stole unpublished designs or copied them without the owner's consent. Justice Black, however, would not permit vigilante justice. He said that the fact that a person was engaged in <b>tortious</b> <b>conduct</b> would not allow a group to refuse in concert to deal with him and would not justify [...] "combining together to regulate and restrain interstate commerce in violation of federal law." [...] Kirkpatrick pointed out that the Supreme Court, but not Judge Hand, properly followed the principle that the Supreme Court had explained in United States v. American Livestock Comm'n Co., which distinguished between joint refusals to participate in unlawful conduct and joint refusals to deal where [...] "the wrong is completely independent of the dealingsinto which the combination refuses to enter."

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{seeks to}} argue that ‘Company Y’ is responsible for {{its role in the}} use of inhumane and tortious interrogation techniques during the CIA’s Interrogation and Detention Program under the Alien Tort Statute. Furthermore, this analysis will seek to reconcile case law in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel v.

Significantly, this analysis will also answer questions left open in the Kiobel decision by arguing that corporate entities, such as Company Y, may be held liable in U. S. courts for violations of international law. Although the Kiobel decision strongly indicated that corporate liability may attach under the Alien Tort Statute (hereinafter ATS) if there is a sufficient nexus to the United States, the court ultimately left open two questions of law: (1) whether corporations could be liable for <b>tortious</b> <b>conduct</b> under the ATS, and, if so, (2) under what circumstances the ATS could apply to conduct occurring outside the geographic territory of the United States. Notably, circuit courts disagree as to whether corporate liability exists under international law, and, if it does, how to determine whether such liability results in a colorable ATS claim.
