25|$|Snatch {{operations}} with IB: In late 2009, investigative journal The Week ran {{a cover story}} on one of India's major clandestine operations that the R ran with Intelligence Bureau <b>to</b> <b>nab</b> terrorists infiltrating India, via Nepal and other neighbouring countries. To bypass the lengthy extradition process, R conducts snatch operations <b>to</b> <b>nab</b> suspects from various foreign countries. The suspect is brought to India, interrogated in black sites, later shown as arrested at an airport or border post and is usually produced before a court. With emergence of Nepal as a terror transit point R and the IB started closely monitoring the movement of suspected terrorists in Nepal. According to The Week, in last decade there has been close to 400 successful snatch operations conducted by R and/or IB in Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries. Some famous snatches netted Bhupinder Singh Bhuda of the Khalistan Commando Force, Lashkar militant Tariq Mehmood and Abdul Karim Tunda, Sheikh Abdul Khwaja, one of the handlers of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Yasin Bhatkal founder leader of the proscribed terrorist organisation Indian Mujahideen etc. most of the suspects are kept at Tihar Jail.|$|E

On 4 July 1838 heavy rainfall struck the area, disabling the winding engine on the vertical shaft. The workers stranded at the pit bottom were instructed to remain there until they were able to be brought up to the surface, but a number of children decided to try and escape via the dayhole <b>to</b> <b>Nabs</b> Wood. A nearby stream had burst its banks in the rain and a torrent of water entered the shaft, drowning 26 children aged 7 to 17.

On October 17, 2014, JPJ will continue its crackdown on drivers and cars affiliated to the personal driver app, which has been growing in popularity with urbanites. Despite the hiccup, the department suspects that Uber services are still available for loyal customers. Since October 2014, the Land Public Transport Commission has impounded 44 Uber vehicles, using many methods such as tracking the vehicles using Uber's app. It was also reported that some taxi drivers have taken it upon themselves <b>to</b> <b>nab</b> Uber drivers and turn them over to the police.|$|E

500|$|In Memphis, Brinkley met 21-year-old Minerva Telitha [...] "Minnie" [...] Jones, {{a friend}} of Crawford's and the {{daughter}} of a local physician. On August 23, 1913, after a four-day courtship, Brinkley and Jones married at the Peabody Hotel, even though he was still married to Sally Brinkley. Minnie and John Brinkley honeymooned in Kansas City, Denver, Pocatello and Knoxville. Brinkley was arrested in Knoxville and extradited to Greenville where he was put in jail for practicing medicine without a license and for writing bad checks. Brinkley told the sheriff that it was all Crawford's fault, and gave investigators enough information that they were able <b>to</b> <b>nab</b> Crawford in Pocatello. The two former partners met again in jail. Brinkley and Minerva had a son, John, who committed suicide in the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against interferon-b (IFNb) reduces clinical efficacy and markers of bioactivity {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS), although {{it has also been}} shown that a poor response to IFNb coincided with unexpectedly low <b>NAb</b> levels. <b>To</b> try and resolve this incoherency, this study investigated 2822 patients referred <b>to</b> a <b>NAb</b> testing facility. The reason for NAb testing was indicated for 2506 patients: routine testing (76 %), worsening of disease (14 %) and other reasons (10 %). Overall, 31 % of patients were NAb positive and 17 % had titres high enough to obliterate IFNb bioactivity. The frequency of NAbs was similar in patients in the routine testing group compared with the worsening group. Samples showing high titres failed to be associated with worsening of symptoms. The study failed <b>to</b> show low <b>NAb</b> levels in patients responding poorly to IFNb. It is concluded that it is not possible <b>to</b> predict <b>NAb</b> status by clinical impression of treatment response. This is likely to be an effect of the partial efficacy of IFNb. Thus routine testing for NAbs must be carried out in order <b>to</b> identify <b>NAb</b> status in patients with MS...|$|R

In new immunizations, we attempted <b>to</b> improve <b>nAb</b> responses by removing the N 362 glycan that also lines the CD 4 bs. All 4 rabbits developed nAbs. One targeted the N 197 glycan hole like our previous sera. Two sera depended on the N 463 glycan, again suggesting CD 4 bs overlap. Heterologous boosts appeared <b>to</b> reduce <b>nAb</b> clashes with the N 362 glycan. The fourth serum targeted a N 362 glycan-sensitive epitope. VLP manufacture challenges prevented us from immunizing larger rabbit numbers to empower a robust statistical analysis.

500|$|The poor {{support for}} the Sega CD has often been criticized as the first link in the {{devaluation}} of the Sega brand.
