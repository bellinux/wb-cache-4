But no sting of conscience, no ill <b>treatment</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and no self-reproaches for failing in his duty of confession as a good Catholic, were powerful enough in their influence over Gabriel to make him disclose the secret, under the oppression of which his very life was wasting away. He knew that if he once revealed it, whether his father was ultimately proved to be guilty or innocent, there would remain a slur and a suspicion on the family, and on Perrine besides, from her approaching connection with it, which in their time and in their generation could never be removed. The reproach of the world is terrible even in the crowded city, where many of the dwellers in our abiding-place are strangers to us--but it is far more terrible in the country, where none near us are strangers, where all talk of us and know of us, where nothing intervenes between us and the tyranny of the evil tongue. Gabriel had not courage to face this, and dare the fearful chance of life-long ignominy--no, not even to serve the sacred interests of justice, of atonement, and of truth.|$|E

Other mechanized forms of treatment in the mid 19th century included Hydrotherapy with a pelvic douche massager, where cold water was blasted at a high pressure at a woman's abdomen. These devices were harder to sell to doctor’s offices because of the expense and the equipment needed to produce the right amount of water pressure, so spas took up the practice offering it not just as muscle therapy but also for treatment of hysteria.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Lymphedema often {{requires}} intensive, costly treatment which initiates {{in the clinic}} and is eventually self-administered by the patient <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> In-clinic Complete Decongestive Therapy aims to reduce limb volume, improve mobility, and {{reduce the risk of}} infection. Maintaining these clinical gains requires that the patient continues the <b>treatments</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Self-administering these <b>treatments,</b> however, can prove difficult, leading to loss of the therapeutic gains achieved during the in-clinic phase, especially when clinicians must moderate the recommendations to adapt to a patient’s physical limitations and/or the demands of one’s social and work obligations. Adding an advanced pneumatic therapy device in the home may assist with overcoming barriers associated with the complex requirements of self-administered lymphedema care. By providing a consistent, passive treatment option, patients may be better able to maintain the clinical progress achieved during in-clinic therapy. The purpose of this retrospective case review was to assess whether adding such a device to the at-home treatment regimen made a difference in the patient’s ability to manage lymphedema independently. This case study follows a patient with primary bilateral lower extremity lymphedema from initial in-clinic therapy through to her two year follow-up visit. Barriers to lymphedema management faced by this patient are identified, the clinical reasoning for the various treatment options tried is provided and the subsequent functional outcomes are presented. The case study suggests that the Flexitouch system offers promise as an adjunct to in-home treatment for patients whose lymphedema has proven challenging to control...|$|R
