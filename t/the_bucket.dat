5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> or <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

5|$|In this way, <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost {{but not quite}} species specific, as {{it is possible for}} a few closely related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid, as long as the bees are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E
50|$|We {{create some}} buckets and put {{vertices}} into <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> {{according to their}} ranks inductively. That is, vertices with rank 0 go into <b>the</b> zeroth <b>bucket,</b> vertices with rank 1 go into <b>the</b> first <b>bucket,</b> vertices with ranks 2 and 3 go into <b>the</b> second <b>bucket.</b> If <b>the</b> Bth <b>bucket</b> contains vertices with ranks from interval 2r = R - 1 then <b>the</b> (B+1)st <b>bucket</b> will contain vertices with ranks from interval 2R.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> leaky <b>bucket</b> as a meter {{is exactly}} {{equivalent}} to (a mirror image of) <b>the</b> token <b>bucket</b> algorithm, i.e. <b>the</b> process of adding water to <b>the</b> leaky <b>bucket</b> exactly mirrors that of removing tokens from <b>the</b> token <b>bucket</b> when a conforming packet arrives, {{the process of}} leaking of water from <b>the</b> leaky <b>bucket</b> exactly mirrors that of regularly adding tokens to <b>the</b> token <b>bucket,</b> and <b>the</b> test that <b>the</b> leaky <b>bucket</b> will not overflow is a mirror of the test that <b>the</b> token <b>bucket</b> contains enough tokens and will not 'underflow'. Thus, given equivalent parameters, the two algorithms will see the same traffic as conforming or nonconforming. <b>The</b> leaky <b>bucket</b> as a queue {{can be seen as}} a special case of <b>the</b> leaky <b>bucket</b> as a meter.|$|R
5|$|Freeman played Lucius Fox in a trilogy of Batman films: Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). During that time, Freeman also {{appeared}} in <b>The</b> <b>Bucket</b> List (2007) opposite Jack Nicholson, Wanted (2008) with Angelina Jolie, and Invictus (2009) with Matt Damon. In 2011, Freeman received the AFI Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. Two years later he starred in action thriller Olympus Has Fallen (2013), science fiction film Oblivion (2013), caper Now You See Me (2013), and comedy Last Vegas. In 2014, Freeman appeared in the science fiction films Transcendence and Lucy.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. <b>The</b> <b>bucket</b> orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bucket</b> bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5000|$|Burstsort {{algorithms}} use a trie {{to store}} prefixes of strings, with growable arrays of pointers as end nodes containing sorted, unique, suffixes (referred to as buckets). Some variants copy the string tails into <b>the</b> <b>buckets.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> grow beyond a predetermined threshold, <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> are [...] "burst", giving the sort its name. A more recent variant uses a bucket index with smaller sub-buckets to reduce memory usage. Most implementations delegate to multikey quicksort, {{an extension of}} three-way radix quicksort, to sort the contents of <b>the</b> <b>buckets.</b> By dividing <b>the</b> input into <b>buckets</b> with common prefixes, the sorting {{can be done in}} a cache-efficient manner.|$|R
50|$|Next, the ten {{judges are}} each handed a ball. They then leave their seats and {{walk up to}} the box. Each judge places his/her ball {{secretly}} into either the white or red <b>bucket,</b> indicating <b>the</b> team they prefer, and without anyone else seeing. Once the ten balls have been placed in <b>the</b> <b>buckets,</b> <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> are taken out of the box and then handed to two women. The two women then walk up on stage with <b>the</b> <b>buckets.</b> A third woman follows <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> while holding a basket containing six additional balls - representing the remaining points to be earned.|$|R
30|$|After 3  weeks, some mould and {{bacterial}} growth was {{visible on the}} water surface of <b>the</b> <b>buckets.</b> This growth was removed from all <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> {{once or twice a}} week until the experiment was finished.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A Bucket of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at <b>the</b> <b>Bucket</b> of Blood sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.|$|E
5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. <b>The</b> <b>bucket</b> seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
50|$|The insert {{operation}} is extended to increment {{the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>buckets,</b> and <b>the</b> lookup operation checks that each of <b>the</b> required <b>buckets</b> is non-zero. <b>The</b> delete operation then consists of decrementing the value of each of <b>the</b> respective <b>buckets.</b>|$|R
30|$|After 1, 2, 4, and 6  weeks, {{water samples}} {{were taken from}} each of <b>the</b> {{experimental}} <b>buckets.</b> <b>The</b> samples were placed in 150 -ml plastic bottles, cooled with iced packs, and transported to the laboratory the same day. The water losses from <b>the</b> <b>buckets</b> due to <b>the</b> sampling were not compensated. At {{the start of the}} experiment, five random samples were also taken from the tap water used to fill <b>the</b> <b>buckets.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E
25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to <b>the</b> <b>bucket.</b> Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E

25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. <b>The</b> <b>bucket</b> is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E
