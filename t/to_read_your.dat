2500|$|According to Michael Tomasello, the key {{cognitive}} capacity distinguishing Homo sapiens {{from our}} ape cousins is [...] "intersubjectivity". This entails turn-taking and role-reversal: your partner strives <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>your</b> mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, {{and each of}} you makes {{a conscious effort to}} assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.|$|E
2500|$|Focus Attacks, {{known as}} Saving Attack in the Japanese version, {{is a new}} system {{introduced}} in Street Fighter IV. The Focus Attack is a move that allows the player to absorb an attack and launch a counterattack, and it is performed by pressing the medium punch and medium kick buttons simultaneously. There are two phases to the attack. In the first phase, the player will shift into a new stance, at which point {{he or she is}} able to absorb a single hit from the opponent. The second phase is the counterattack. The longer the player holds down the medium punch and kick buttons, the more powerful the attack will be. If the buttons are held for long enough the attack will be unblockable and cause the opponent to crumple slowly to the ground, allowing the player to follow up with a free hit. Attacks that were absorbed during the first phase of a Focus Attack still cause damage to the player; however, life lost from the opponent's attack will be quickly regenerated afterward. In addition, during {{the first phase of the}} Focus Attack, the player may perform a dash either forward or backward to cancel the Focus Attack. Finally, at the cost of two bars of the Super Combo gauge, many Special Moves can be canceled into a Focus Attack. By executing a Focus Attack during the Special Move, the animation of the move will be cut short and go instantly into the Focus Attack animation. This allows players with precise timing to cancel Special Moves into Focus Attacks, and in turn cancel Focus Attacks into the forward dash, resulting in new combo possibilities. If a Special Move is blocked by the opponent, the new system allows players to cancel the blocked move with a Focus Attack, and then cancel the Focus Attack by dashing backward safely away from the opponent. Ono has stated that this system was incorporated in order to shift the emphasis away from combos and toward a more realistic system he has compared to boxing, in which [...] "the skill is in reading your opponent's move before he or she starts moving ... We haven't forgotten about combos and linked moves, but focus makes it so that you have <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>your</b> opponent." [...] The system aims to make ground attacks as viable a way of approaching opponents as jumping was in previous games. The focus system is a core part of Street Fighter IVs gameplay.|$|E
