25|$|The {{most basic}} sexual system {{is one in}} which all organisms are hermaphrodites, {{producing}} both male and female gametes— <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> some animals (e.g. snails) and the majority of flowering plants. In many cases, however, specialization of sex has evolved such that some organisms produce only male or only female gametes. The biological cause for an organism developing into one sex or the other is called sex determination.|$|E
25|$|MWI response: the {{splitting}} can {{be regarded}} as causal, local and relativistic, spreading at, or below, the speed of light (e.g., we are not split by Schrödinger's cat until we look in the box).

25|$|Because they {{innervate}} many muscles, some {{clusters of}} α-MNs receive {{high concentrations of}} neurotrophic factors and survive this stage of neuronal pruning. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the α-MNs innervating {{the upper and lower}} limbs: these α-MNs form large cell columns that contribute to the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord. In addition to receiving neurotrophic factors from muscles, α-MNs also secrete a number of trophic factors to support the muscle fibers they innervate. Reduced levels of trophic factors contributes to the muscle atrophy that follows an α-MN lesion.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} for a class of graphs that is not closed under minors to have bounded local treewidth. In particular <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the 1-planar graphs, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with one crossing per edge, and more generally for the graphs that can be drawn on a surface of bounded genus with a bounded number of crossings per edge. As with minor-closed graph families of bounded local treewidth, this property has pointed the way to efficient approximation algorithms for these graphs.|$|E
25|$|As just suggested, the {{phenomena}} that c-command {{is intended to}} address may be more plausibly examined in terms of linear order and a hierarchy of syntactic functions. Concerning the latter, some theories of syntax take a hierarchy of syntactic functions to be primitive. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), and dependency grammars (DGs). The hierarchy of syntactic functions that these frameworks posit is usually something like the following: SUBJECT > FIRST OBJECT > SECOND OBJECT > OBLIQUE OBJECT. Numerous mechanisms of syntax are then addressed {{in terms of this}} hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The aim of some later novels {{has been}} to {{concentrate}} as much on local colour as on the story. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> William Percival Crozier's historical romance The Fates Are Laughing (1945), set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula, written by a classicist with an eye for detail.|$|R

25|$|Many {{mathematical}} {{models of}} physical systems are deterministic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> most models involving differential equations (notably, those measuring {{rate of change}} over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called stochastic. Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to numerical instability and a finite amount of precision in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the other}} printed commentaries which are {{attributed}} to Rashi were composed by others, primarily his students. In some commentaries, the text indicates that Rashi died before completing the tractate, {{and that it was}} completed by a student. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the tractate Makkot, the concluding portions of which were composed by his son-in-law, Rabbi Judah ben Nathan, and of the tractate Bava Batra, finished (in a more detailed style) by his grandson, the Rashbam. There is a legend that the commentary on Nedarim, which is clearly not his, was actually composed by his daughters. Another legend states that Rashi died while writing a commentary on Talmud, and that the very last word he wrote was 'tahor,' which means pure in Hebrew - indicating that his soul was pure as it left his body.|$|E
25|$|From {{this time}} {{until her death}} in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, {{reaching}} a maximum size of 4000 to 5000 workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. (<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> most species in most areas; however, Vespula squamata, {{in the southern part}} of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by scores of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells.) At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.|$|E
