5|$|The Su-25UBM is a twin seat variant {{that can}} be used as an {{operational}} trainer, but also has attack capabilities, and can be used for reconnaissance, <b>target</b> <b>designation</b> and airborne control. Its first flight was on 6 December 2008 and it was certified in December 2010. It will enter operational use with the Russian Air Force later. The variant has a Phazotron NIIR Kopyo radar and Bars-2 equipment on board. Su-25UBM's range is believed to be 1,300km and it may have protection against infra-red guided missiles (IRGM), a minimal requirement on today's battle fields where IRGMs proliferate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Automatic parking systems {{consist of}} three core technologies: <b>target</b> {{position}} <b>designation,</b> path planning, and path tracking. <b>Target</b> position <b>designation</b> methods {{can be divided}} into four categories: user interface-based, parking slot marking-based, free space-based, and infrastructure-based. Considering the fact that parking assist systems are expected to be used mainly in urban situations, recognition of parking slot markings could be the most economical and efficient solution for <b>target</b> position <b>designation.</b> This article proposes a semi-automatic parking slot marking-based <b>target</b> position <b>designation</b> method. The user can initiate parking slot marking recognition by placing a finger {{on each side of the}} entrance of the target parking slot. With such a user interface, these systems can reduce the search range to so small an area that computational loads and false recognition rates are significantly reduced. Furthermore, by identifying the junction patterns of parking slot markings around the designated point with a neural network-based classifier, the user can establish the target position with a uniform user interface. The proposed system showed a 91. 10 % recognition rate in 191 test cases consisting of five different types of parking slot markings...|$|R

2500|$|The lookout and <b>target</b> <b>designation</b> {{facilities}} {{were similar in}} principle to Dunkerques. The lower lookout station for close-range contacts was on platform 3 of the fore tower.

40|$|Abstract: Automatic/semi-automatic parking system {{consists}} of three components: <b>target</b> parking position <b>designation,</b> path planning, and path tracking. This paper summarizes published papers about <b>target</b> parking position <b>designation</b> up to now, and proposes four phase strategy based on the strong and weak points of each method. Generally, <b>target</b> parking position <b>designation</b> can be classified into four categories: GUI-based, parking slot marking-based, free space-based, and infrastructure-based. Among them, according to used sensor and signal processing technology free space-based {{can be divided into}} seven categories again: ultrasonic sensor-based, short range radar(SRR) -based, still image-based, motion stereo-based, binocular stereo-based, light stripe projection(LSP) based, and scanning laser radar-based. As we can not find one almighty method, we expect <b>target</b> parking position <b>designation</b> method to evolve according to changes of related technologies and industrial environments. Our prediction suggests four phase strategy: 1) Ultrasonic sensor-based free space detection + rear view camera-based monitoring, 2) ultrasonic sensor-based free space detection + human machine interface (HMI) + semi-automatic parking slot markings recognition, 3) scanning laser radar-based + HMI + semi-automatic parking slot markings recognition, and 4) scanning laser radar-based...|$|R

[...] Following a short-notice decision to deploy, the first batch of six aircraft were readied to deploy in under 72hours, including the adoption of desert camouflage, and additional equipment, and departed from Lossiemouth for the Middle Eastern theatre early on 26 January 1991. [...] In theatre, it became common for each attack formation to comprise four Tornados and two Buccaneers; each Buccaneer carried a single laser designator pod, and acted as backup to {{the other in the}} event of an equipment malfunction. [...] The first combat mission took place on 2 February, operating at a medium altitude of roughly , and successfully attacked the As Suwaira Road Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of World War I, Wolsey served in the Atlantic Fleet. In the late 1920s, she operated on the China Station. After the British river steamer SS Kutwo collided with and sank a Chinese troop-carrying launch on the Yangtze River and Chinese authorities threatened to seize her at Nanking in early March 1927, Wolsey {{arrived on the scene}} and came alongside Kutwo to repel by force any Chinese attempt to board her, and Wolseys sailors also boarded a British hulk nearby and forced off Chinese students who had boarded it to stage a demonstration; the light cruiser [...] soon joined Wolsey at Nanking as a reinforcement. During the Nanking Incident, Wolsey steamed at full speed from Wuhu to Nanking on 24 March 1927 to reinforce Emerald and the United States Navy destroyers [...] and [...] and patrol yacht [...] as they confronted Chinese troops threatening foreigners ashore; she arrived as the other ships opened fire on Chinese positions and, without a <b>target</b> <b>designation</b> for her larger guns, used her machine guns against Chinese snipers which had harassed the other ships and their boats all day.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} novel light stripe projection-based <b>target</b> {{position}} <b>designation</b> method for an intelligent parking assist system, providing an economical free space-based <b>target</b> position <b>designation</b> method for poorly lit indoor parking spaces without {{degradation of the}} external appearance when integrated into a vehicle’s body. The proposed method can be applied by adding a low-cost light plane projector to existing backward parking cameras. Light stripe features are detected by {{the difference between an}} image with the light plane projector on and off. Three-dimensional information of the parking area is reconstructed using the light stripe projection theory. By orientation normalization and depth map construction, free spaces are detected and the nearest selected as the target position. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully designate the target position in spite of poor lighting conditions and the black reflective surface of adjacently parked vehicles...|$|R
