30|$|With {{the wide}} use of digital image, image quality {{assessment}} (IQA) becomes extremely important in many applications, such as image acquisition, watermarking, compression, <b>transmission,</b> <b>restoration,</b> enhancement, and denoising [1 – 3]. During the past decades, major advances {{have occurred in}} image quality assessment. Generally, the IQA methods can be classified into two classes: one is the subjective assessment, where the image quality is decided by human observers. The other is the objective assessment, whose goal is to design algorithms to mimic the subjective judgment accurately and automatically. In practice, subjective assessment is usually inconvenient, time-consuming, and expensive. This drawback makes it impractical in real-world applications. According to {{the availability of a}} reference image, objective IQA indices can be classified as full reference (FR), no-reference (NR), and reduced-reference (RR) methods.|$|E

With increased penetration of renewables and upgrade of network complexity in modern grid environment, a resilient and efficient restoration strategy is increasingly desired to enhance system reliability. As {{one of the}} most important tasks for power system planning and operation, power system restoration is regarded as a multi-objective and multi-stage nonlinear constrained optimization problem involving a great number of generation, transmission, distribution and load constraints. For simplifying problem formulation, the process is usually divided into three stages: preparation, system restoration and load restoration, with emphasis on different restoration objective for each stage. A restoration strategy is attained for dispatchers to start blackstart units, establish transmission path to crank non-blackstart units and pick up necessary loads. In existing methodologies, a strategy usually provides optimal starting timetable for all blackstart and non-blackstart units based on fixed time interval timeline in a way that the overall system generation capability is maximized. The insufficiency of this strategy is the inflexibility of the resultant restoration plan due to the assumption that the operation time for each transmission line and the whole restoration time horizon are preassigned fixed values. In modern power system environment, resilience and efficiency are critical and desirable features for electric power system recovery. Consequently, another variable factor of flexible transmission line operation time is taken into consideration while ensuring grid security at the same time, and a novel methodology named optimal efficiency oriented power system restoration has been developed. The proposed efficiency oriented model consists of transmission path search module, operation time calculation module, startup constraints checking module and load pickup module. Particularly, the operation time calculation module is designed to generate a random time matrix T for modeling variable transmission line operation time which complies with beta distribution. Based on this time matrix, power system restoration is formulated as a permutation-based optimization problem. Different from traditional objective of maximizing available generation capability, the proposed novel optimization objective is to maximize available generation capability per unit time named as restoration efficiency for adapting flexible restoration period. Moreover, the optimization solution in terms of non-blackstart units startup permutation is solved through one optimization process for generator startup permutation and <b>transmission</b> <b>restoration</b> path. For practical application, a flexible restoration schedule is generated according to the optimal solution, and provides information of non-blackstart generator startup timing, charging path and corresponding available generation at each restoration stage. Another contribution is development of a tailored algorithm referred as advanced quantum-inspired differential evolutionary algorithm (AQDE) to solve the proposed permutation-based restoration model. It features with better population diversity and quicker convergence speed. The superior performance of AQDE has been benchmarked through comparison experiments with two other well established meta-heuristic techniques including QDE and GA. Consequently, the proposed AQDE method is successfully applied to solve the system restoration of IEEE 39 and 118 bus systems respectively. The optimal efficiency oriented power system restoration methodology is also applied on load restoration stage after its validation on the aforementioned system restoration stage. Traditionally at load restoration stage, maximization of restored load becomes primary objective. When applying the proposed novel methodology, however, maximization of restored load per unit time is designed as the optimization objective. In order to reduce the impacts of service disruption on load loss, load prioritization should be taken into consideration in load pickup process. In general, electrical loads can be divided into three levels based on reliability requirements by customers. Load importance degree is defined according to properly ranking the prioritization of loads with reference to pre-signed contracts with customers, where the expected service quality has been specified. Based on the undirected power system topology model, a novel index Ps combining load prioritization and capacitance is proposed for searching optimal path. Finally, a flexible restoration schedule is obtained to provide information for generator startup and load pickup considering load prioritization. The proposed restoration methodology is applied on IEEE 39 and 57 bus systems respectively. The second part of my research work is load modeling. It is an important issue due to the fact that load model significantly affects power system dynamic simulations. In modern power system, there is increasingly desire of delicate load model with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. A delicate load model is called for to capture specific load characteristics of various load components. To catch these characteristics, a complete load model at distribution grid level consisting of equivalent capacitor, large motor and small motor is proposed. Furthermore, the other two models, namely the composite load model and dynamic load model at distribution grid level, are applied to assess the accuracy of the developed complete load model. The comparisons of simulation on case studies have demonstrated that the complete load model has superior performance in transient simulations at distribution grid level and capable to capture more accurate load characteristics than the other two models.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Designing {{networks}} for survivability has received considerable attention {{in recent years}} [2, 3, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27]. For ATM-based broadband networks, multi-layer network survivability and restoration can be possible at the following levels: transmission-level, virtual path-level, and virtual circuit or connection/call-level. At transmission level, SONET self-healing ring for restoration is a viable alternative for a major failure such as a fiber cable cut [27].

40|$|Abstract—Elastic optical {{networking}} (EON) {{has emerged in}} recent years as a promising solution for implementing flexible bandwidth channels (flexpaths) that efficiently match the allocated bandwidth with the traffic demand using agile granularities of spectrum allocation. However, the additional flexibility in such networks raises challenges in terms of efficient control and management of spectrum resources. Among them, three important issues are (1) mitigation of spectral fragmentation, (2) implementation of impairment awareness and enhancement of robustness against impairments for potentially large-bandwidth flexpaths, and (3) design of an efficient restoration scheme to combat network failures.

40|$|Abstract—After a {{power system}} is {{subjected}} to a blackout, par-allel restoration is an efficient means {{to speed up the}} restoration process. The system sectionalizing strategy consists of determining the proper splitting points to sectionalize the entire blackout area into several subsystems, so that parallel restoration can be carried out within the subsystems. For a large-scale power system, this system sectionalizing problem is quite complicated when considering black-start constraints, generation/load balance constraints, and voltage stability constraints. This paper presents an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) –based system sectionalizing method, by which the splitting points can be found quickly. Simulation results on the IEEE 118 -bus test systems show that the method can successfully sectionalize the system into subsystems satisfying black-start constraints, generation/load balance constraints, and voltage stability constraints.

40|$|Abstract—Error {{concealment}} has a {{great importance}} within block-based video decoding systems especially for mobile transmission systems like DVB-T or DVB-H. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal and spatio-bi-temporal fading technique for recovering lost or erroneously received macroblock samples. For spatio-temporal fading based on a boundary error criterion obtained from temporal error concealment, either spatial, temporal, or fading of both methods is used for recovering lost image samples in one macroblock. A weighted absolute difference between well received macroblock boundary samples from the current frame and motion compensated macroblock boundary samples from the previous frame represents the boundary error. The weights for fading are interpolated from the boundary error. For spatio-bi-temporal fading, one lost macroblock can individually be recovered pel-wise spatially from the current or bi-temporally from the previous and the future frame by weighted averaging three different estimations for the lost macroblock. The simulation results have shown that for concealing erroneously received uncompressed and compressed video data the proposed methods outperform the reference methods both in subjective and objective video quality.

30|$|In most {{practical}} multimedia applications, processes {{are used to}} manipulate the image content. These processes include compression, <b>transmission,</b> or <b>restoration</b> techniques, which often create distortions that may be visible to human subjects. The design of algorithms that can estimate the visual similarity between a distorted image and its non-distorted version, as perceived by a human viewer, can lead to significant improvements in these processes. Therefore, over the last decades, researchers have been developing quality metrics (i.e., algorithms) that estimate the quality of images in multimedia applications. These metrics can make use of either the full pristine content (full-reference metrics) or only of the distorted image (referenceless metric). This paper introduces a novel referenceless image quality assessment (RIQA) metric, which provides significant improvements {{when compared to other}} state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method combines statistics of the opposite color local variance pattern (OC-LVP) descriptor with statistics of the opposite color local salient pattern (OC-LSP) descriptor. Both OC-LVP and OC-LSP descriptors, which are proposed in this paper, are extensions of the opposite color local binary pattern (OC-LBP) operator. Statistics of these operators generate features that are mapped into subjective quality scores using a machine-learning approach. Specifically, to fit a predictive model, features are used as input to a gradient boosting machine (GBM). Results show that the proposed method is robust and accurate, outperforming other state-of-the-art RIQA methods.|$|R

40|$|AbstractResin-based cements {{have been}} {{frequently}} employed in clinical practice to lute indirect restorations. However, {{there are numerous}} factors that may compromise the clinical performance of those cements. The aim of this literature review is to present and discuss some of the clinical factors that may affect the performance of current resin-based luting systems. Resin cements may have three different curing mechanisms: chemical curing, photo curing {{or a combination of}} both. Chemically cured systems are recommended to be used under opaque or thick restorations, due to the reduced access of the light. Photo-cured cements are mainly indicated for translucent veneers, due to the possibility of light <b>transmission</b> through the <b>restoration.</b> Dual-cured are more versatile systems and, theoretically, can be used in either situation, since the presence of both curing mechanisms might guarantee a high degree of conversion (DC) under every condition. However, it has been demonstrated that clinical procedures and characteristics of the materials may have many different implications in the DC of currently available resin cements, affecting their mechanical properties, bond strength to the substrate and the esthetic results of the restoration. Factors such as curing mechanism, choice of adhesive system, indirect restorative material and light-curing device may affect the degree of conversion of the cement and, therefore, {{have an effect on the}} clinical performance of resin-based cements.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Inadequately {{polymerized}} resin cements may {{negatively affect}} the clinical performance of cemented all-ceramic restorations. The {{purpose of this}} in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ceramic thickness and shade on the microhardness of various light-cured (LC) and dual-cured (DC) resin cements. The amount of light <b>transmission</b> through the <b>restoration</b> was also evaluated to correlate the results. METHODS: Three different brands of resin cements (Appeal/Ivoclar; Calibra/Dentsply; Nexus 2 /Kerr) were used in LC and DC forms to prepare disk-shaped samples (0. 5 -mm thickness × 5 -mm diameter) (n= 15). Study group samples were light-cured for 40 seconds (Flashlite 1401 /Discus Dental) through four shades (ETC 1, ETC 2, ETC 3, ETC 4) and four thicknesses (1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm) of all-ceramic ingot discs (IPS Empress Esthetic/Ivoclar). Control samples were directly cured without the presence of ceramic. The light transmission through various shades and thicknesses of ceramics was measured using a hand-held radiometer (Demetron, Kerr). Vickers microhardness measurements were performed (Micromet/Buehler) at 24 hours following dark storage in 37 °C water. Correlation between ceramic shade, thickness, and light intensity readings (mW/cm 2) with respect to microhardness was statistically evaluated using analysis of variance (p= 0. 05). RESULTS: Ceramic thickness of 3 mm and/or above significantly decreased the microhardness values in all LC and DC groups (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Ceramic shade {{had a significant effect}} only on Calibra in both LC and DC groups (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Microhardness values of LC groups were significantly lower than DC groups (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Control groups had significantly higher hardness values in all cement groups (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). There was a significant correlation between the amount of light transmitted and hardness (p= 0. 000). CONCLUSION: The ceramic thickness has a more intense effect on polymerization compared to the ceramic shade. Overlying ceramic thickness of 3 mm and above was found to adversely affect the polymerization of LC and DC resin cements and therefore a 3 -mm thickness was considered the critical threshold...|$|R
