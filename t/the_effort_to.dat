5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital.

5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> bring American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service for only a few years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the British and French {{intervened in}} the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau.

The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E

Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over.

5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, despite <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> harvest them {{prior to its}} arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa.

Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved.
