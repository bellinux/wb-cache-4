40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the eighth round of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade {{negotiations}} (GATT). The round is called the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), and lasted from 1986 to 1994. Important issues to developing countries such as agriculture and textiles {{were included in the}} negotiation. The results of the negotiations were that an agreement on tariff reductions was reached, new issues were included and GATT was institutionalised through the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This study focuses on Norwegian agricultural policy and the developing countries in the Uruguay Round. How did Norway combine the goal of protecting national agricultural interests with the developing countries’ demands in the Uruguay Round? A Norwegian dilemma have been identified between these aspects, and the Norwegian Cabinet tried to solve this dilemma with a dualism in the Norwegian position, trying to establish a position that considered both the demands of the developing countries, and the Norwegian agricultural interests. Other areas important to developing countries such as textiles, tropical products and areas where Norway and the developing countries shared interests, were also underlined in an attempt to solve this dilemma. Due to the liberalisations and economic growth in many of the developing countries it was important for the industrialised countries to include these countries in the world trading system. However, the developing countries expressed disappointment when the Final Agreement was reached. The countries meant that the given concessions were limited and the developing countries had expected deeper cuts in subsidies and more market access. The literature identifies both negative and positive consequences for the developing countries by the agreement. Some countries and regions benefited while Africa was regarded as the continent that might loose {{as a result of the}} agreement. The Norwegian Cabinet underlined that protecting the agricultural sector was its main priority in the negotiations, however, it was stated that the quantitative restrictions on agriculture and textiles were in conflict with increased import from the developing countries. I have called this view the acceptance of incompatible interests perspective. By this acceptance the Cabinet stated that there existed a conflict between the interests of the developing countries and Norway in the field of agriculture. In the first phase of the negotiations, a united Storting refuted this conflict’s existence and argued that the Norwegian system was not a hindrance to increased import from developing countries, mainly due to the fact that Norway and developing countries had interests in different products. This perspective I have called the none interest conflict perspective. Even though the Cabinet acknowledged that a conflict existed between Norwegian agricultural interests and the demands of the developing countries, the Cabinet stated that preferences to developing countries should be given in line with the Norwegian national goals in agricultural policy. This is a strong indication that it was the Norwegian agricultural interests that was the first priority. However, when realising that a new position had to be established, and by acknowledging the acceptance of <b>tariffications,</b> it may also be argued that Norway gave important concessions also to developing countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} tariffication-conversion of a variable import levy, widely used in the European Community, into an equivalent ad valorem tariff on trade and welfare. While tough negotiations lie ahead over the exact rates of tariff reduction, contracting countries in principle agreed to <b>tariffication</b> proposed by the United States. If producers are risk neutral, <b>tariffication</b> {{has no effect on}} production and trade, and gains from a GATT agreement in the Uruguay Round depend on the extent of tariff reductions. If domestic producers are risk averse, however, <b>tariffication</b> reduces domestic production of the importable and thus has a trade expansion effect, which causes a shift in the import demand curve. This trade expansion effect may dominate the increased trade effect resulting from a negotiated tariff reduction, which causes a movement along the import demand curve.

Eventually Japan's rice was made exempt from <b>tariffication</b> by compensating in the form of increased 'minimum access' import quotas. However, the <b>tariffication</b> rule of the final agreement guarantees that importing countries can impose considerably high tariffs.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} <b>tariffication</b> on Canadian milk {{producers}} were estimated via supply, price and trade flow parameters using a spatial price equilibrium model applied to milk production regions of Canada and the United States. Two price scenarios were put forward because of supply management in Canada. The first incorporated producer prices {{while the second}} used shadow prices for Canadian producers, defined as the producer price less a reduction in price which accounts {{for the value of}} production quota. The hypothesis that <b>tariffication</b> reduces milk production in Canada to the extent that U. S. producers increase their exports to Canada was partly supported in scenario one but not in scenario two. Specific tariffs of $ 11. 00 /hl prevented U. S. imports to reach Qu 'ebec and Ontario. However, the rest of Canada increased its imports from Great Lakes to the detriment of Quebec and Ontario. Consequently, production decreased slightly in Qu 'ebec and increased in Ontario, whereas prices decreased significantly in both provinces. Scenario two showed ability of Qu 'ebec and Ontario to withstand American competition. Prices and production level remained unchanged while export flows to the rest of Canada increased {{to the detriment of the}} Great Lakes.

40|$|According to the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), all {{agricultural}} non-tariff {{trade barriers}} should {{be converted into}} equivalent tariffs and further, reduced over time. However each member country {{has the authority to}} choose the tariff types when it converts NTBs to tariffs such as ad valorem tariff and specific tariff. The paper tries to find the reason for the choice of a certain type of tariff in the process of <b>tariffication</b> after the UR negotiation on agriculture. To achieve this goal, the paper analyses the effects of <b>tariffication</b> of a fixed quota into tariffs on price, trade and welfare in a number of scenarios related to the sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we examine the nonequivalence of specific tariff and ad valorem tariff, which are general type of tariffs used in the most of countries.

And the key of decision is amount of the stock when is faced to the choice problem of the special treatment or the <b>tariffication.</b> The notable simulation results are as follows: (1) Self-sufficiency is achieved by raising a government-purchasing price. (2) However this political process result in increasing the stock.

In the worst case, the amount of stock reaches up to 72. 4 % of domestic consumption. (3) When accepting <b>tariffication,</b> the problem of the stock surplus is mitigated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{lay out the}} case, as I see it, for <b>tariffication</b> of services. I argue that the {{prospects}} for achieving significant liberalization of the international provision of services will be greatly improved if something like this proposal is followed. By amending the GATS to permit countries to tax foreign providers of services {{in a manner that}} is roughly analogous to tariffs on imported goods, countries will be encouraged to bring most categories of services under GATS discipline. Of course, that discipline will be much weakened by doing this, since the taxes may be set so high that little if any trade will occur. However, once this is done, it will become possible for countries to negotiate reductions in these service tariffs in exactly the same way that they have done for goods over the last fifty years. Considering the amount of time it has taken to achieve significant liberalization of trade in goods, we should not expect to achieve it in services any time soon. However, by starting the process with <b>tariffication,</b> we place services upon the same well-traveled road that has been followed before, and we can be more confident that the future negotiating process will take us where we want to go, even if we cannot know how soon we will get there. ...|$|E
