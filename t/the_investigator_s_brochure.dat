40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} risk of oral {{contraceptives}} on the occurrence of cervical cancer. Material and Method: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. Sixty women patients with histo-logically confirmed invasive cervical cancer and 180 healthy women as the control group who attended the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were recruited. Information {{about the use of}} oral contraceptives and other cervical cancer risk factors were obtained from personal interviews. The risk factors were evaluated by using odds ratio (OR). Results: 60 women with invasive cervical cancer and 180 healthy controls were interviewed by <b>the</b> <b>investigator.</b> <b>s</b> Compared with non-users, patients who had ever used or currently used oral contraceptive had an increased risk of cervical cancer (OR 1. 45; 95 % CI 0. 79 - 2. 64). However, the risk was not statistically significant. Considering the duration of use, patients who had used oral contraceptives for 3 years or less did not have an increased risk of cervical cancer (OR 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 39 - 1. 77). Nevertheless, the odds ratio of oral contracep-tive pill use for more than 3 years was 2. 57 (95 % CI 1. 22 - 5. 49) which was statistically significant. Conclusion: Long-term use of oral contraceptive might be a cofactor that increases the risk of cervical carcinoma. Further investigations should be conducted to confirm this risk. However, Pap smear has to be done routinely in long-term oral pill users...|$|R

40|$|The skin, one of {{the largest}} organs of the body, is {{composed}} of three layers: the epidermis, dermis and subcutis. The outer most part of the epidermis i. e., the stratum corneum - serves as a protective barrier between the individual and the environment, defending the body from mechanical injuries, foreign chemical substances, microbes and loss of water. Both inherited and acquired abnormalities of the stratum corneum may increase the sensitivity of the skin to environmental factors and predispose it to the development of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. Such a diagnosis is based on the medical history, clinical examination and appropriate patch testing. However, the reading of patch tests is subjective, provides qualitative information and the results depend largely on <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> <b>s</b> experience. To obtain objective, comparable data, various bioengineering techniques have been designed to evaluate various aspects of the skin s response. In this Thesis, we used visual scoring together with several established non-invasive methods (transepidermal water loss, Corneometer, laser Doppler) and a new one (electrical impedance) to assess the irritant and allergic contact reactions, the effects of the treatment on skin sensitivity and skin dryness. In Paper I, we used the above-mentioned techniques to evaluate clinically similar allergic (to NiSO 4 in distilled water in different concentrations) and irritant (to 2 % sodium lauryl sulphate) skin reactions in 19 nickel-allergic patients. In Paper II, patch tests with 0. 5 % and 2 % NiSO 4 in petrolatum were done on the forearm of 20 nickel-allergic patients and five healthy subjects, which had been pre-treated with a urea-containing moisturiser. Skin areas that had not been pre-treated were used for comparisons. In Paper III, 2 % sodium lauryl sulphate and 40 % non-anoic acid were used by two independent laboratories to induce irritant contact reactions in 40 healthy volunteers. In Paper IV, the dry skin of the lower legs of 24 healthy elderly subjects was treated twice daily with two identical creams, one of which contained urea and sodium chloride and the other urea alone. In Paper V, 2 % sodium lauryl sulphate in distilled water was used to produce irritant contact dermatitis in 29 eczema patients and 19 healthy controls. The main conclusion of this thesis is that bioengineering techniques give descriptive, detailed information about pathophysiological changes in the skin of patients. Our data suggest that, in addition to well-established biophysical methods, this new impedance technique is of value for experimental studies of contact dermatitis. However, more investigations are needed before it can be used in routine diagnostic work, e. g., technical refinement and the development of guidelines for impedance measurements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between a clinical investigator and a research subject has generated considerable debate because <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> occupies two distinct roles: clinician and scientist. As a clinician, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has duties to provide the patient with optimal care and undivided loyalty. As a scientist, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has duties to follow the rules, procedures and methods described in the protocol. Results and conclusion In this article, I present a contextual approach to the investigator-subject relationship. The extent of <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> duty to provide the patient/subject with clinical care can vary from one situation to the next, as a function of several factors, including: the research design, benefits and risks of the research; the subject's reasonable expectations, motivations, and vulnerabilities; <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> ability to benefit the subject; and <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> prior relationship with the subject. These and other factors need to be considered when determining <b>the</b> clinical <b>investigator's</b> obligations to provide clinical care to human research subjects. In some research contexts, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has extensive clinical obligations to the patient/subject; in others, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> has minimal ones. </p...|$|R

30|$|Even {{as early}} as <b>the</b> 1900 <b>s,</b> <b>investigators</b> had {{suggested}} uncompensated elevated IAP as a possible etiologic factor {{in the development of}} preeclampsia [10, 46]. While elevated IAP may not be the only, sole, or critical inciting factor, its potential role in the development or progression of such syndromes certainly is plausible. Mauriceau noted the preponderance of 'toxemia' of pregnancy in primiparas in 1694 [42]. Paramore, also noting this prevalence, hypothesized that nulliparous and muscular women were prone to spastic abdominal wall tone resulting in elevated IAPs, compromising perfusion pressure to the abdominopelvic viscera [10, 46]. Mulier was able to indeed confirm a linear relationship between abdominal pressure and volume to calculate the abdominal wall elastance (E) [47] and even found that E decreased significantly with increased age and gravidity [48]. Sugerman recently hypothesized that IAH {{played a central role in}} initiating the multi-system cascade of diminished perfusion and inflammation associated with the various clinical manifestations of preeclampsia [49]. He speculated obstructed venous return from IAH, essentially limiting abdominal perfusion pressure due to increased back pressure, resulted in decreased end-organ perfusion including both kidneys and the placenta. Thus, the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, with elevation of aldosterone levels, systemic hypertension, and placental ischemia/necrosis with an impact on fetal growth, was triggered [49].|$|R

Building on interviews with a random sample of 319 adults in the Chicago metropolitan area, we turn our attention to cultural age "deadlines " for a series of general transitions related to education and work. While a rough, "normal biography " of educational and work life existed in the minds of our respondents, the deadlines attached to that biography were flexible guidelines for how those trajectories might unfold, not rigid, normative principles. We relate these findings to complementary evidence on family transitions, and we consider our findings in light of two lively scholarly debates. One debate concerns the degree to which various life spheres (e. g., family, education, and work) are more or less structured by age, and the other debate concerns the degree to which men's lives are more or less structured by age compared to women's lives...|$|R
