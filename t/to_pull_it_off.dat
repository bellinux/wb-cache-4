5|$|O'Farrell's {{replacement}} {{was to be}} Scotland coach, Tommy Docherty. Docherty {{left the}} Scotland job and his first task at United {{was to keep the}} club in the top flight. He managed it once, but he was unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> again and the club was relegated in 1973–74. They bounced straight back up the following season, though, and in their first season back in the top flight, the team cruised to a third-place finish and yet another FA Cup final. The next year, they went one better, beating Liverpool in the final to claim his first and only trophy at Old Trafford. It was soon discovered, however, that Docherty {{was having an affair with}} the wife of the club's physiotherapist, and he was immediately fired, replaced by Queens Park Rangers' manager Dave Sexton.|$|E
25|$|The Brachiosauridae are {{composed}} of quadrupedal dinosaurs that are generally very large, {{with the exception of}} the possible insular dwarf Europasaurus. The brachiosaurids can be distinguished from other macronarian taxa by their broad, thick and spoon-shaped teeth. Their maxillary teeth were twisted apically, at the top, and the shape of these teeth was optimal for biting off resistant vegetation. While brachiosaurids, like other sauropods, did not perform significant food processing in their mouths, their teeth enabled them to slice through food instead of having <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> of tree branches. Evidence for this precision shearing consists of apical wear facets on the teeth and distinctive bone structure that suggests orthal, vertical, jaw action.|$|E
25|$|The two leads, Hansard and Irglová, {{are both}} {{professional}} musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead {{to be played}} by actor Cillian Murphy, who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy was {{also going to be}} one of the film's producers. But Murphy declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old) and also felt that he hadn't the vocal capabilities to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film The Commitments, the story of a Dublin soul music cover band. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.|$|E

500|$|The first {{ship was}} begun in November 1951 {{and the other}} two {{followed}} in 1952. By this time Stalin's support was the main impetus behind the ships and little time was wasted cancelling them after his death on 5 March 1953. Stalingrads hull was ordered to be used for weapons tests while the two other ships were scrapped where they lay. The hull was launched in 1954 after it was modified to suit its new role. It was towed from Nikolayev to Sevastopol in 1955, but it grounded at the entrance to Sevastopol Bay. Initial attempts <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the rocks by brute force failed, and the capsizing of the battleship [...] further delayed salvage work, so that she was not freed until mid-1956.

500|$|Moore {{called the}} battle {{sequence}} [...] "remarkable", {{even though the}} series had already included several space battles. Moore felt {{they were not going}} to top the previous ones, but the visual effects team were able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> as [...] "the best battle sequence we've ever done." [...] A scene cut from the teaser's battle sequence showed Samuel Anders aiming his Viper's guns at Diana Seelix's ship after discovering his Cylon nature. Another Anders cut scene focused on cutting the cast off his leg, due to the absence of his leg injury sustained from [...] "The Son Also Rises". With Baltar's storyline, the writers refer to the rooms used by his cult as [...] "Baltar's lair". Also, as the writers were aware that Baltar himself was visually similar to Jesus, Moore points out that he is not Jesus, though he admitted that the visual similarities help to [...] "drive some things home".|$|E

They explained that while it was quite ambitious and heady for a Saturday morning children's program, [...] "it's somehow appropriate that Star Trek is able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> successfully." [...] They compared this episode to the live action Star Trek episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren" [...] where Kirk and his crew also gain superpowers, saying it was [...] "a better episode, as Kirk pleads humanity's case to the Megans."

500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E

Stephen Holden of Blender called Wainwright's tribute [...] "a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled {{the spirit of the}} ultimate gay icon", and declared the album was [...] "as good an introduction to the great American songbook as any". Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote that Wainwright [...] "elegantly outdoes [...] on a couple of the ballads" [...] and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, [...] "who turns in a stunning, showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show". In his review for Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau stated it was [...] "a relief to hear him essay the show tunes and Tin Pan Alley chestnuts of this tribute album". Furthermore, he wrote that the songs [...] "expand [...] melodic compass", allowing him to [...] "bring something new to them too – namely, sexuality in the sensuality as opposed to gender-preference sense". Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine had positive comments about the album: [...] "That Wainwright has the temerity to cover such a bona fide classic—and the chops <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without breaking a limb or his brain—speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1991 MTV special {{hosted by}} Kurt Loder titled Breakfast with Madonna, Loder {{described}} the video as [...] "amazing", then asked Madonna if {{her father had}} seen it.

[...] After MTV world-premiered the video on November 11, 1989, they wanted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> broadcast until the scene with the lips shut was removed. Madonna disagreed {{and told them that}} she would cancel future deals with the channel, prompting MTV to air the video again. The music video has been honored by Rolling Stone as one of [...] "The 100 Top Music Videos", placed at number66.

2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that Galis {{was not only a}} legendary scorer, but that he was also a great play maker and passer.

Galis' mid-range jumper was one of his biggest offensive weapons, being able <b>to</b> consistently <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> under pressure. His post game was excellent, as he used his strength and leaping ability to counter his lack of height. Another enormous competitive advantage that Galis possessed was his incredible stamina, which was due to his exemplary physical condition.

The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007.

[...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America.

[...] Slant Magazine included Ceremonials at number 22 on its list of The 25 Best Albums of 2011, commenting that the album is [...] "steeped in melodrama, with pump organs, choirs, and strings expertly deployed as pure pomp on already rousing singles like 'Shake It Out' and 'No Light, No Light.' But Welch is perfectly capable of doing delicate too, as evidenced by the gorgeously textured lead single 'What the Water Gave Me' and 'Never Let Me Go,' while tracks like [...] "Lover to Lover" [...] are reminiscent of the Eurythmics at their most soulful."

40|$|On May 21, 2016, 250 {{participants}} and 70 volunteers came {{together for the}} second Amy’s Ride/Run/Walk, which raises money for pancreatic cancer research in honor of Amy Cygan Spier. One of 11 siblings, Amy was just 54 {{years old when she}} succumbed to pancreatic cancer in November 2014. For the brothers and sisters she left behind, the event is a labor of love. The idea for a fundraiser began to take shape after the Cygans learned how comparatively little money is devoted to pancreatic cancer research. With a number of cyclists in the family, a bike ride seemed like a logical choice. Given Amy’s great love for family, they wanted to include a walk, as well, making the event family friendly. Since then, they’ve planned and executed two successful events in Quakertown Memorial Park—raising more than $ 54, 000 for researchers in the Jefferson Department of Surgery. As one brother, Mike Cygan, explains, half of the siblings are either business owners or project managers, making their skills a natural fit for planning the event. <b>To</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> all <b>off,</b> the siblings convene for biweekly and then weekly planning calls, and use online tools to collaborate from multiple locations. Mike adds that while the events have been successful in raising money for the cause, the process of supporting Amy—both during and after her battle—has had another benefit: bringing the Cygan siblings closer. “As the oldest sibling, I have to admit that in the younger side of the family, I didn’t know my siblings as adults until now,” says Mike. “I’ve learned a lot about them over the past few years. ” Amy’s sister, Celeste Cygan Vaughn, agrees, and notes that community support has been another blessing: “I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the generosity of people we know—in terms of time and money. It’s amazing. ” The Cygans believe that generosity also extends to the Jefferson clinicians, including Harish Lavu, MD, who was Amy’s surgeon, and Ashwin R. Sama, MD, who served as her medical oncologist. “All of us individually got to know some of the staff at Jefferson through Amy’s battle,” explains another brother, Tony Cygan. “It’s just an incredible bunch of folks and an incredible program. They’ve supported us with this initiative and been terrific. ” The event has been especially meaningful to Mike’s next-door neighbor, Nancy Parry, whose husband, Al, was also a pancreatic cancer patient at Jefferson. “When I arrive at the event and see Al’s oncologist and nurse and surgeon, I don’t have to go over to them and say, ‘Hi, do you remember me?’ They come and seek me out and greet me with bear hugs and inquire about how I’m doing,” says Nancy. “I’m overwhelmed by that. ” Planning for the third event—scheduled for Saturday, May 20, 2017 —is already underway. The Cygans encourage everyone to participate. After all, this is a family that’s big: in number, in support and in love.

Now back on soaps, Brook’s Mr. Fuller is really making a case for Hope (Kim Matula) to be with him … instead of wishy-washy Liam (Scott Clifton)!" [...] On-Air On-Soaps on the {{character}} of Wyatt and Brooks's portrayal. According to Brooks, the reaction to Wyatt on social media was initially very mixed. However, his co-star Scott Clifton said the support for Wyatt was very overwhelming due to Liam's checkered past with Hope. TV Source Magazine described Brooks's introduction as [...] "memorable." [...] Dan J. Kroll described Wyatt's first appearance as [...] "eye-opening." [...] Luke Kerr said the series [...] "isn’t wasting a moment" [...] getting Brooks to strip, in reference to Wyatt being naked in his first scene. CBS Soaps In Depth said of the character's introduction: [...] "Most men would get slapped for going around planting unsolicited kisses on a girl who is adamantly engaged to someone else, but somehow, Wyatt manages <b>to</b> not only <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> but also melt our hearts in the process." [...] ABC Soaps In Depth listed Wyatt in their [...] "Best & Worst of 2013" [...] list as the [...] "Coolest Cat." [...] Of the character, the magazine said, [...] "we can't help being charmed by Liam's new sibling Wyatt.

[...] When asked to compare Brooks to Wyatt, Scott Clifton said much like his portrayer, Wyatt has a certain [...] "ease" [...] when he comes into a new environment. [...] "They're very comfortable and it makes you very comfortable around them. Darin brings a lot of that to Wyatt. Wyatt doesn't walk around worried about how people are going to perceive him. That's a cool quality that I wish I had more of, actually." [...] However, Clifton said [...] "The arrogance" [...] in Wyatt is what sets Brooks apart from his character. Michael Fairman said that Wyatt's vow to never interfere in a marriage makes him [...] "a bit more redeemable." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described the character of Wyatt as [...] "defiant and confident" [...] and said the character's introduction as a [...] "breath of fresh air into the Liam/Hope relationship."
