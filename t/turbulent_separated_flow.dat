40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the Eleventh Asian Congress of Fluid Mechanics as an invited/keynote lecture. The lecture&# 13; summarizes development of physical model for transfer processes in <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flows.</b> Attention is focused on the&# 13; factors that have led to significant advances in understanding of the mechanisms of transfer processes in separated flows,&# 13; which differs from those in traditional attached turbulent flows in channels and zero pressure gradient turbulent flows. The&# 13; physical model of transfer processes in the near-wall region of <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> and reattached <b>flows</b> based on the&# 13; assumption of the governing role of generated local pressure gradient that takes place in the immediate vicinity of the wall in&# 13; <b>separated</b> <b>flow</b> as a result of intense instantaneous accelerations induced by large-scale vortex flow structures is discussed. &# 13; Similarity laws for mean velocity and temperature profiles and spectral characteristics of the transfer processes resulting in&# 13; the physical model are confirmed by the available experimental data.

The paper summarizes the development of a physical modelling of transfer processes in packed beds. It is shown that the available quantitative measurements of structural characteristics of infiltrated flow in packed beds such as the near-wall zone velocity and temperature profiles and velocity pulsation spectra follow the similarity laws of <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flows</b> that have been developed by the author and are represented {{in the first part of}} the paper. These facts supported by visual observations of flow patterns in packed beds from various authors allow implementing the analogy between transfer processes mechanism in <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flows</b> and convective transfer processes in near-wall zone of surfaces embedded in grainy layers, or ducts filled with packed bed, at high Reynolds numbers. This approach has resulted in the asymptotic heat and mass transfer law. The universal character of the heat and mass transfer law for the surfaces embedded in grainy layer is confirmed by the author's data and data from many other studies...|$|R

The mean-strain term of the pressure-strain correlation is formulated by incorporating the tensor with the Reynolds stresses that account for a non-isotropic turbulence effect in the flows which are accompanied by a <b>turbulent</b> <b>separating</b> <b>flow.</b> This model is compared with other existing models and results are verified with existing experimental results for turbulent shear flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{parabolic}} Navier-Stokes (PNS) marching finite-difference {{method is}} applied to 3 -D viscous flow over pointed ogive-cylinders, and to turbulent flow over a cone. Ogive computations were performed using the new technique recently reported by Vigneron, Rakich, and Tannehill. Comparison is made with experiment and inviscid computations. The present results show that this method, which neglects part of the pressure gradient in the x-momentum equation, is nevertheless valid for flows with a strong favorable pressure gradient. In addition, <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow</b> over a cone has been computed using the older PNS code due to Lubard and Helliwell.

The architecture of Illiac IV is described, and the use of its parallel operation is demonstrated on the example of its solution of the one-dimensional wave equation. For fluid dynamics problems, a special FORTRAN-like vector programming language was devised, called CFD language.

40|$|Relative {{performance}} of several passive and active methods for controlling two-dimensional <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow</b> {{associated with a}} curved backward-facing ramp were investigated at low speeds. Surface static pressure measurement and oil flow visualization results indicate that submerged vortex generators, vortex generator jets, elongated arches at +-alpha, and large-eddy breakup devices at +-alpha placed near the baseline separation location reduce flow separation and increase pressure recovery. Spanwise cylinders reduce flow separation but decrease pressure recovery downstream. Arches with alpha = 0 deg, Helmholtz resonators, and Viets' fluidic flappers examined so far have no significant effect in reducing separation. Wall cooling computation indicates that separation delay on a partially cooled ramp is nearly the same as on a fully-cooled ramp while minimizing the frictional drag increase associated with the wall cooling process...|$|E

Shadowgraphs indicate gouging ablation of the aft portion of the frustum; the gouging was moderate in air and severe in the noble gases. The graphite models break in the same region. An explanation of the phenomena is offered {{in terms of the}} strong compression and shear caused by the reattachment of a <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow.</b> Conditions are calculated for similar tests appropriate for Von Karman Facility of the Arnold Engineering Development Center in which a larger model can be flown in argon...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{solutions}} of the complete, time-averaged conservation equations using several eddy-viscosity {{models for}} the Reynolds shear stress to close the equations are compared with experimental measurements in a compressible, <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow.</b> An efficient time-splitting, explicit difference scheme was used to solve the two-dimensional conservation equations. The experiment used for comparison was a turbulent boundary layer that was separated by an incident shock wave in a Mach 2. 93 flow with a unit Reynolds number of 5. 7 x 10 to the seventh power m. Comparisons of predicted and experimental values of surface pressure, shear stress along the wall, and velocity profiles are shown. One of the tested eddy-viscosity models which allows the shear stress {{to be out of}} equilibrium with the mean flow produces substantially better agreement with the experimental measurements than the simpler models. A tool is thereby provided for inferring additional information about the flow, such as static pressures in the stream, which might not be directly obtainable from experiments...|$|E

This wall law was derived from a one-dimensional analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy equation with gradient diffusion concept employed in modeling the near-wall shear stress gradient. Numerical testing cases for the present wall functions include <b>turbulent</b> <b>separating</b> <b>flows</b> around an airfoil and turbulent recirculating flows in several confined regions.

For vortex rows with unidirectional rotations flow separations are explained by Knapp’s cycle, for noncavitating flows as well. For Karman vortex rows the vortex formation is attributed to alternate jet formations. Some of the main conclusions are derived from cavitation tunnel experiments.

40|$|Flow {{phenomena}} {{and the relative}} performance associated with several devices for controlling <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow</b> were investigated at low speeds. Vortex-generating devices examined included: submerged vortex generators (Wheeler doublet and wishbone types), spanwise cylinders, large-eddy breakup devices (LEBU) at small angle of attack (alpha), and vortex-generator jets (VGJ). Dye flow visualization tests in a water tunnel indicated that wishbone vortex generators in the forward orientation shed horseshoe vortices; wishbone vortex generators oriented in the reverse direction and doublet vortex generators shed streamwise counterrotating vortices; a spanwise cylinder located near the wall and LEBUs at alpha = - 10 deg produced eddies which rotated with the same sign as the mean vorticity in a turbulent boundary layer; and the most effective VGJs produced streamwise corotating vortices. Comparative wind tunnel tests conducted on a curved backward-facing ramp indicated that transferring momentum from the outer region of a turbulent boundary layer by embedded streamwise vortices {{is more effective than}} by transverse vortices for separation control applications...|$|E
40|$|The two-equation kappa-epsilon {{model is}} used to analyze <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow</b> past a backward-facing step. It is shown that if the model {{constraints}} are modified {{to be consistent with}} the accepted energy decay rate for isotropic turbulence, the dominant features of the flow field, namely the size of the separation bubble and the streamwise component of the mean velocity, can be accurately predicted. In addition, except {{in the vicinity of the}} step, very good predictions for the turbulent shear stress, the wall pressure, and the wall shear stress are obtained. The model is also shown to provide good predictions for the turbulence intensity in the region downstream of the reattachment point. Estimated long time growth rates for the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate of homogeneous shear flow are utilized to develop an optimal set of constants for the two equation kappa-epsilon model. The physical implications of the model performance are also discussed...|$|E

The flow equations and the turbulent model equations are solved using a fifth-order accurate weighted essentially. nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme for space discretization and a third order, total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. Qualitatively the computed pressure distributions exhibit the same behavior as those observed in the experiments. The computed separation regions are much longer than those observed experimentally. However, the percentage reduction in the separation region in the steady suction case is closer to what was measured in the experiment. The computations did not predict the expected reduction in the separation length in the oscillatory case. The predicted turbulent quantities are {{two to three times}} smaller than the measured values pointing towards the deficiencies in the existing turbulent models when they are applied to strong steady/unsteady separated flows...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} incompressible <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flows</b> {{is carried out}} by using two-equation turbulence models of the K-epsilon type. On the basis of realizability analysis, a new formulation of the eddy-viscosity is proposed which ensures the positiveness of turbulent normal stresses - a realizability condition that most existing two-equation turbulence models are unable to satisfy. The present model is applied to calculate two backward-facing step flows. Calculations with the standard K-epsilon model and a recently developed RNG-based K-epsilon model are also made for comparison. The calculations are performed with a finite-volume method. A second-order accurate differencing scheme and sufficiently fine grids are used to ensure the numerical accuracy of solutions. The calculated results are compared with the experimental data for both mean and turbulent quantities.

40|$|Reynolds stress closure models {{based on}} the {{recursion}} renormalization group theory are developed for the prediction of <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flows.</b> The proposed model uses a finite wavenumber truncation scheme {{to account for the}} spectral distribution of energy. In particular, the model incorporates effects of both local and nonlocal interactions. The nonlocal interactions are shown to yield a contribution identical to that from the epsilon-renormalization group (RNG), while the local interactions introduce higher order dispersive effects. A formal analysis of the model is presented and its ability to accurately predict <b>separated</b> <b>flows</b> is analyzed from a combined theoretical and computational stand point. Turbulent flow past a backward facing step is chosen as a test case and the results obtained based on detailed computations demonstrate that the proposed recursion -RNG model with finite cut-off wavenumber can yield very good predictions for the backstep problem...|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to predict}} surface {{pressure}} distributions on lifting surfaces {{have been relatively}} unsuccessful in the transonic regime when the shock wave is of sufficient strength to produce an extensive region of <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow.</b> For these conditions, the viscous flow behavior must be accurately described even to obtain reasonable predictions of surface pressure. The present paper addresses this problem. Detailed comparisons between prediction and experiment are made for a transonic, turbulent boundary-layer separation (freestream Mach number = 0. 875) for which the turbulent flow properties (including the turbulent Reynolds stress) had been measured by the laser velocimeter technique from upstream of the separated region through reattachment. The flow was generated on an axisymmetric 'bump' model designed to simulate the flow on an airfoil at transonic conditions. The numerical methods used in the comparisons include {{the solution of the}} time-dependent, mass-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the solution of the compressible boundary-layer equations by the inverse method. Solutions were obtained for the well established Cebeci-Smith algebraic turbulence model and the more recently developed Wilcox-Rubesin two-equation turbulence model...|$|E

A chord-based Reynolds number of Re(sub c) = 47, 500 is set up, with a turbulent in flow of Re(sub theta) = 1, 400 (theta/c = 3 %). FDL 3 DI, a code that solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations using high- order compact-difference scheme and filter, with the standard recycling/rescaling method of turbulence generation, is used. Two different configurations of the upper-wall are analyzed, and results are compared with both a higher Re(sub c) (= 936, 000, Re(sub theta) = 7, 200, theta/c = 0. 77 %) experiment for major flow features, and RANS (k-omega SST) results. A lower Rec allows for DNS-like mesh resolution, and an adequately wide span. Both ILES and RANS show delayed reattachment compared to experiment, and significantly higher skin friction in the forebody of the hump, as expected.

At the chosen freestream conditions, the forebody boundary layer and the separated flow on the afterbody are turbulent. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes method along with two commonly used turbulence models are used to compute the flowfield. Accurate prediction of <b>turbulent</b> <b>separated</b> <b>flow</b> at hypersonic conditions is challenging due to {{the limitations of the}} underlying turbulence models. The presence of turbulent eddy viscosity in the flow simulation results in a smaller separation bubble than the laminar solution at identical conditions. Also, the two turbulence models predict different levels of eddy viscosity in the neck region. This has a dominant effect on the separation bubble size and the surface pressure. On the other hand, the eddy viscosity values in the near-wall region determine the heat transfer rate to the body. The two models predict comparable heating rates on the conical frustum, and the results match in-flight measurement well. By comparison, surface pressure predictions are appreciably higher than the data...|$|E
