5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. <b>The</b> <b>potato</b> allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight Colorado potato beetles. Before the adoption of <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> however caused the European Potato Failure, a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|E

5|$|As Philadelphia became industrialized, {{immigrants}} from England, Ireland, and Germany {{settled in the}} city and the surrounding districts. <b>The</b> <b>potato</b> famine was just underway causing emigration from Ireland.

5|$|During the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact {{countries}} {{launched a}} widespread war against <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> beetle, blaming {{the introduction of}} the species from America on the CIA, demonising the species in propaganda posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.|$|E
5|$|Solanum watneyi, {{a species}} of bush tomato from Australia, has been named after the {{character}} of Mark Watney, to honor the fictional heroic botanist portrayal. It {{is a member of}} the same genus as <b>the</b> <b>potato,</b> Solanum.|$|E
50|$|Hasselback Potato or Potato à la Hasselbacken (Swedish: Hasselbackspotatis) are a type {{of baked}} <b>potato,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> are about halfway cut through into thin slices; butter, breadcrumbs, and almonds are added on top of <b>the</b> <b>potatoes.</b>|$|R

5|$|This {{plant was}} {{introduced}} to North America simultaneously by the French colonists in Canada and the British in the Thirteen Colonies {{for use as a}} root vegetable, but in the mid-19th century, it was replaced as the main source of starch by <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> and consequently was less widely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|A central Food Production Committee, set up {{in early}} 1942, {{organised}} the conscripted labourers and attempted to help the white farmers to grow all the crops they could. Maize production grew by 40% between 1942 and 1944, <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> harvest doubled and the onion crop grew sixfold {{by the end of}} the war. Production of the colony's most important cash crop, tobacco, was high throughout the war, averaging about 40million pounds (18million kg) annually.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the arrival of}} foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to <b>the</b> <b>potato.</b> Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E

50|$|Potato {{harvesters}} are {{machines that}} harvest potatoes. They work by lifting <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> from <b>the</b> bed using a share. Soil and crop are transferred onto {{a series of}} webs where the loose soil is sieved out. <b>The</b> <b>potatoes</b> are moved towards {{the back of the}} harvester on to a separation unit and then (on manned machines) to a picking table where people pick out the stones, clods, and haulms by hand. <b>The</b> <b>potatoes</b> then go on to a side elevator and into a trailer or a potato box.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>potatoes</b> {{are cooked}} by slow stewing {{in a closed}} pot with fat and stock. Lard, beef {{dripping}} or butter {{may be used as}} the fat. It is also common to stew <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> in water alone with onion before adding the other ingredients. Stovies may be accompanied by oatcakes.|$|R
5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was <b>the</b> <b>potato,</b> domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. Coca, still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, {{as were the}} peanut, tomato, tobacco, and pineapple. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals were also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{cultural}} controls {{may be used}} {{in combination}} with crop rotation: Mulching <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> crop with straw early in the growing season may reduce the beetle’s ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch creates an environment that favours beetle's predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as pitfall traps to catch the beetles as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; Flamethrowers may also be used to kill the beetles when they are visible {{at the top of the}} plant's foliage.|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> harvest each year.

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station.

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. <b>The</b> <b>potato</b> strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|Its first {{association}} with <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> plant (Solanum tuberosum) {{was not made}} until about 1859 when it began destroying potato crops {{in the region of}} Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140km per year. By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America. From 1875, several western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland, banned imports of American potatoes to avoid infestation by L. decemlineata.|$|E
