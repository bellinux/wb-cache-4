5|$|SR78 {{was one of}} the {{original}} state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959. The freeway section in the North County of San Diego that connects Oceanside and Escondido was built {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century in several stages, including a transitory stage known as <b>the</b> <b>Vista</b> Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012. There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region.|$|E
5|$|By 1947, US395 ran {{concurrently}} {{along the}} portion of SR78 from Vista to Escondido before continuing along Santa Fe Avenue to Bonsall and Fallbrook and rejoining its alignment during the 1970s. At this time, all of SR78 that existed had been paved. Before the present-day freeway was built, SR78 was routed on <b>the</b> <b>Vista</b> Way Freeway (which was an expressway) from Oceanside east to downtown Vista. After this, it followed Santa Fe Avenue and Mission Road east (now signed as CR S14), continuing onto Grand Avenue in Escondido. Following the intersection with US395, SR78 turned south on Ash Street and rejoined the current alignment of the highway. In 1949, the rerouting of SR78 from US395 to US99 was listed as a priority by local officials. The road was known for its curves, even though it went over relatively flat terrain; this reduced its efficiency.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971. While the El Camino Real interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September, {{and the rest of}} the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining traffic signal. Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of <b>the</b> <b>Vista</b> Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} the Auld Alliance, and the {{beginnings}} of the grand tour, meant that French styles were particularly important in Scotland, although adapted for the Scottish climate. From the late seventeenth century the gardens at Versailles, with their formal avenues, parterres and fountains that stressed symmetry and order, were a model. After the Glorious Revolution Dutch influences were also significant, with uniform planting and topiary. Gardening books from the continent and England became widely available in this period and the first gardening book published in Scotland, John Reid's, Scots Gard'ner (1683), borrowed from John Evelyn's (1658) translation of Nicholas de Bonnefon's Le Jardinair françois (1651), adapting its ideas for Scottish conditions. In the late seventeenth century William Bruce put Scotland at the forefront of European garden design, lowering garden walls to incorporate the surrounding countryside into <b>the</b> <b>vista.</b> This allowed a focus on significant landscape features such as Bass rock at Balcaskie and Loch Leven Castle at Kinross. Alexander Edward (1651–1708) continued in the tradition established by Bruce, adding landscapes at houses including Hamilton Palace and Kinnaird castle, Angus. Grand schemes in the French tradition included James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry (1662–1711) reworking of the terraces at Drumlanrig Castle, which incorporated the Douglas family crest into the parterres design, and the militaristic earthworks undertaken for Field Marshal John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1679–1747) at Castle Kennedy, Wigtownshire. Earl of Mar's (1675–1732) palace at Alloa was the grandest realisation of the Versailles style gardens in Scotland: it included canals, parterres, statues and ornamental trees.|$|E

50|$|The {{oil field}} is in two parts, <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Hills Area and <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Front Area, both roughly linear {{features}} about 12 mi long, running parallel {{about two miles}} (3 km) apart, and each being one to two miles (3 km) across, and trending from southeast to northwest. The town of Taft is adjacent to the southwest, about halfway along the field. The oil field underlies <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Hills, a low range with a maximum elevation of 1300 ft, in their entirety, and <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Front Area is mostly in <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Valley, which separates <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Hills from <b>the</b> larger Elk Hills range to the north. State Route 33 parallels <b>the</b> Buena <b>Vista</b> Field about two miles (3 km) to the southwest, and State Route 119 cuts across the field to the northeast, towards Bakersfield.|$|R
