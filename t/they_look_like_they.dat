5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are wearing armor, {{as they have}} two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
500|$|It has {{received}} positive critical reception, with McManus conducting an eight-page interview and profile of Hughes in {{appreciation of the}} series. The magazine had previously published a special issue centered on the network and its shows in July 2012, but overlooked Off the Air, presenting an [...] "opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show." [...] Speaking {{from the first time}} he watched it, McManus praised it for not being [...] "your typical try-too-hard-to-be-weird production." [...] In Adweek, Sam Thielman ranked it second place out of 18 other programs on the network. He tied it with the network's parody infomercial specials and wrote that it was [...] "in the same category as King Star King among things that are so cool and strange that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> should probably be part of a video installation in an art gallery somewhere." ...|$|E
50|$|All of the contraptions {{were created}} using objects that might {{actually}} be found in an abandoned hotel, and {{in such a way}} that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had been created by a gifted 13-year-old boy.|$|R
5000|$|Lontong balap: {{literally}} means [...] "racing rice cake", {{which is}} a dish of rice cakes, fried tofu, and beansprouts, doused in kecap manis and sambal sauce. In the past, lontong balap hawkers carried their wares in a large, heavy metal urn. The heaviness caused them to have to walk really quickly while carrying it, so <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "racing".|$|R

2500|$|Stephenson {{says that}} he looks {{everywhere}} for inspiration and is always sketching. He adds that he is [...] "never bored", and that just {{walking down the street}} one can find inspiration from [...] "things on the sidewalk, the type of tiles, the paintings on the signs, there's always something to inspire you". His McLaren office is full of toys. Stephenson says of this: [...] "that's the nature of any designer, you'll find they have a toy shop around". He also {{says that he}} looks to the animal kingdom for design, using what's called biomimicry. Having a deep passion for biology and evolution, he tries to [...] "find the principles in nature that makes products do what <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> do".|$|E
2500|$|... "Sheriff Arpaio {{has made}} public {{statements}} that a fact finder could interpret as endorsing racial profiling, such as stating that, even lacking 287(g) authority, his officers can detain people based upon 'their speech, {{what they look}} like, if <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> came from another country'... Moreover, he acknowledges that MCSO provides no training {{to reduce the risk}} of racial profiling, stating 'if we do not racial profile, why would I do a training program?'" [...] Judge Snow expanded the complaint into a class-action lawsuit, including all Latino drivers stopped by the Sheriff's Office since 2007, or who will be stopped in the future. He also enjoined the MCSO and all of its officers from [...] "detaining any person based only on knowledge or reasonable belief, without more, that the person is unlawfully present within the United States, because as a matter of law such knowledge does not amount to a reasonable belief that the person either violated or conspired to violate the Arizona human smuggling statute, or any other state or federal criminal law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{criticism}} {{toward the}} film was the animation. Many criticized it as cheap, wooden, non-engaging, and out-of-date; some reviewers drew negative comparisons to 1960s marionette-based shows Thunderbirds and Fireball XL5, although George Lucas previously said the animation style was a deliberate homage to such shows. Tom Long of The Detroit News said the animation [...] "is downright weak compared to what's generally seen on screens these days" [...] and said the characters are so stiff <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "carved by Pinocchio's father." [...] Roger Ebert said [...] "the characters have hair that looks molded from Play-Doh, bodies that seem arthritic, and moving lips on half-frozen faces—all signs that shortcuts were taken in the animation work." [...] McCarthy said [...] "the movements, both of the characters and the compositions, look mechanical, and the mostly familiar characters have all the facial expressiveness of Easter Island statues." [...] But {{some of the same}} reviewers who criticized the animation acknowledged some positive elements about it; McCarthy said it allowed for [...] "somewhat more dramatic compositions and color schemes," [...] and Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said the scenery and backgrounds were [...] "vivid and alive", although she said the characters [...] "move as you would imagine the statues at a waxworks might." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Mark Davey and his partner Annette came across a [...] "sickening" [...] scene: two large groups of {{slaughtered}} sheep, about two miles apart, in the hills near Devil's Bridge. In a statement to local newspapers, he reported [...] "that something had quite clearly attacked them because <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had been ripped apart" [...] and that [...] "to kill so many sheep in such a small area {{it had to be}} quite a strong animal".|$|R
5000|$|Young {{purchased}} a triangular {{piece of land}} between Park Avenue, Grant Street, and Clinton Street. Many of his next houses were built either here or nearby. Abide {{was the first of}} these homes. It had even fewer straight lines than its predecessors, which was especially apparent in the roof. Young liked to say that he [...] "built roofs and then shoved the houses underneath." [...] Because he refused to cut down trees on the property, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> grew around the house. Abide has Young's first fireplace made of Onaway stone.|$|R
5000|$|All this {{ceremony}} had a curious mark of evasion. The government seemed {{to fear the}} phantom they were summoning up. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were both displaying Napoleon {{and at the same}} time hiding him. Everything that would have been too great or too touching was left in shadow. Whatever was real or grand was hidden away beneath more or less splendid shrouds; the imperial cortège was hidden within the military cortège, the army within the National Guard, the parliamentary chambers within the Invalides and the coffin within the cenotaph. Instead, Napoleon should have been considered boldly and openly - honouring him properly, treating him royally and popularly as an emperor; and then they would have found strength where they nearly stumbled.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, on Mollusk Island, {{four men}} known as McPherson, O'Neal, Kelly and DeWulf wash up on shore in a boat. They {{claim to have}} been lost at sea for a few weeks, but Chief Fighting Prawn becomes {{suspicious}} {{when he says that}} <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were out at sea for a few days. He and Peter {{keep a close eye on}} the four men, especially O'Neal.|$|E

50|$|Coming off {{the back}} of their maiden Grand Final appearance, the Cowboys were strong premiership favourites heading into the 2006 season. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> would be living up to those expectations, with a six-game winning streak to start the season. It wouldn't last though, as the club would lose eight of their next 10, {{including}} a six-game losing streak which left them outside the Top 8 halfway through the season. A win against arch-rivals Brisbane in the Queensland derby put them into 6th place with six games remaining but they would lose Johnathan Thurston to injury and another losing streak followed, dashing their finals aspirations. Wins over South Sydney and Parramatta ended their season a good note but it wasn't enough, the pre-season title favourites finishing the season in 9th.|$|R
5000|$|And after a {{visit to}} New York in 1977, Emaer {{returned}} with even greater ambitions—to create the Parisian answer to Studio 54 which he found impressive and repulsive at the same time.

50|$|Most Streets in Sukrawarpet {{are rather}} narrow, {{with a few}} {{exceptions}} like RG Street, Sukrawarpet street, Uppukaner lane, Big bazaar street.

50|$|In his 2013 lecture, Thomas Holtz Jr {{stated that}} fused nasal bones and the {{presence}} of incisors were some of the unique traits of Tyrannosaurus and its relatives. He stated that most reptiles do not have incisors, having teeth {{at the front of the}} jaw that are similar to the ones at the rest of the jaw, and suggested that these incisors were used to scrape the meat from bones. He also stated that Tyrannosaurus teeth were different from previous theropods because they were thick from side to side and while the teeth of many other theropods had roots just as long as the crown, the teeth of Tyrannosaurus had roots that were twice as long as the crowns. He further states that the teeth of Tyrannosaurus didnt <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were for cutting but instead <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were for pulverizing, crushing and piercing.|$|R
5000|$|Another of Burns's job at Disneyland {{was what}} is called [...] "figure-finishing." [...] Figure-finishing {{involves}} applying paint and other finishes to Disneyland attractions and mannequins to create a [...] "finished" [...] look. Burns personally designed and painted the set pieces and underwater figurines for the Submarine Voyage ride. She applied individual feathers to the animatronic birds in Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, which opened in 1963. Burns later confessed in a 2005 interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Tiki Room birds were {{one of her most}} challenging projects ever. [...] "When they breathed out, it would be fine, but when they came back <b>they</b> scrunched. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had mites." [...] She managed to fix the look of the birds and actively maintained the Tiki Room attraction after its opening. Similarly, she created the birds for the film, Mary Poppins.|$|R
5000|$|Emaer's {{inspiration}} for Le Palace {{was not just}} the crowd pressing more and more at the door to the Sept to hear Guy Cuevas, but a visit to New York in 1977, in which he discovered Studio 54. He was impressed and repulsed at the same time. [...] "It is completely sterilized, a ghetto for model agencies and Régine's emirs...." [...] He described the clubgoers as [...] "totally clean, beautiful, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are fed on high quality corn." [...] He became determined to offer a French response, eventually choosing Le Palace, the decrepit theater and architectural gem on rue Faubourg Montmartre.|$|E
5000|$|Another type of {{black-and-white}} bicolor cat {{is referred}} to as a [...] "cow cat" [...] or [...] "moo cat" [...] and includes the magpie, cap-and-saddle and mask-and-mantle patterns. A cow cat does not have the solid black [...] "jacket" [...] of the tuxedo cat. Instead, it has large black patches over a mostly white body, often with a black mask over the head. [...] "Black-mask cats" [...] are so called because <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are wearing a black mask over their head. The Turkish Van (white and red) is one good example of a bicolor breed.
