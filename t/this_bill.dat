5|$|<b>This</b> <b>bill</b> {{establishes}} {{a weapon of}} violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far worse than the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or {{the violence of the}} Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in <b>this</b> <b>bill</b> fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.|$|E
5|$|A varied {{programme}} {{plays at}} the cinema, from arthouse movies to big new releases. <b>This</b> <b>bill</b> attracts a varied crowd of local residents and students. The Leeds International Film Festival {{began at the}} venue in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill. As per <b>this</b> <b>bill,</b> trusts were established to maintain temple funds and given complete {{power over the}} administration of temples. This act evoked severe protests from some sections of the assembly which {{felt that this was}} an intrusion in the religious affairs of the populace. However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while expressing his concern over some of its provisions.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{she became}} the first {{political}} promoter of the law against stalking offence. This law was finally approved on 23 February 2009, introduced as a package of bills known as the Decreto Maroni. In the same year she signed a campaign against homophobia in Italy, with television spots, images on magazines and wall attachments on cities. She also proposed a bill against homophobia, in which homophobia was considered as an aggravating circumstance in bullying events. <b>This</b> <b>bill</b> was next refused by the Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear {{on the floor of}} the other. <b>This</b> <b>bill</b> would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and <b>this</b> <b>bill</b> {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind <b>this</b> <b>bill,</b> creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5000|$|H.R. 1700, a bill {{to allow}} for Medicare {{beneficiaries}} to contract with any health care professionals that provide care covered under the Medicare program, with special circumstances, introduced March 3, 2011, reintroduced in the 113th Congress as H.R. 1310. <b>This</b> <b>bill's</b> provisions are included in Title X of EPFA.|$|R

5|$|The Madras University Act {{was passed}} in the year 1923. The bill was {{introduced}} by Education Minister Sir A. P. Patro. As per the provisions of <b>this</b> <b>bill,</b> the governing body of the Madras University was completely reorganised on democratic lines. The bill asserted that the governing body would henceforth be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro-Chancellor who was usually the Minister of Education. Apart from the Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor who were elected, {{there was to be}} a Vice-Chancellor appointed by the Chancellor. In 1925, the Andhra University Act was passed which included similar reforms in Andhra University.|$|E
5|$|The Minister for Home Affairs, King O'Malley, who was {{responsible}} for the legislation creating the ACT, also introduced a bill in 1910 making the ACT an alcohol-free area; <b>this</b> <b>bill</b> was passed by the Federal parliament and the law was not repealed until 1928. Until that time local residents travelled to Queanbeyan, just across the New South Wales border, to drink on Saturday. In 1938 the Territory was formally renamed the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. <b>This</b> <b>bill</b> has a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge.

5|$|With {{the funds}} {{available}} from the UERL and the route decided, the CCE started site demolitions and preparatory works in July 1902. On 21 November 1902, the CCE published another bill which sought compulsory purchase powers for additional buildings for its station sites, planned the take-over of the E and abandoned the permitted but redundant section of the line from Kentish Town to the proposed depot site near Highgate Road. <b>This</b> <b>bill</b> was approved as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1903 on 21 July 1903.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{that the}} GNR would divert its Moorgate {{services}} over the City Widened Lines to run via the GN, the Met sought {{to take over}} the GN A bill was presented in 1912–13 to allow this with extensions to join the GN to the inner circle between Moorgate and Liverpool Street and to the Waterloo & City line. The takeover was authorised, but the new railway works were removed from the bill after opposition from City property owners. The following year, a bill was jointly presented by the Met and GNR with amended plans that would have also allowed a connection between the GN and GNR at Finsbury Park. Opposed, this time by the North London Railway, <b>this</b> <b>bill</b> was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|During the Reconstruction Era, Confederate {{veterans}} {{were initially}} prohibited from holding public office or from practicing law in West Virginia {{without taking a}} test oath. The West Virginia House of Delegates passed a bill in 1868 that allowed Monroe to practice law without having to swear an oath. Following the passage of <b>this</b> <b>bill,</b> he resumed {{the practice of law}} in Romney. In 1872, he represented Hampshire County at the West Virginia Constitutional Convention in Charleston. In 1875, Monroe returned to politics when he was elected as a Democrat to represent Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates for one two-year term. It was during this legislative session that Monroe served as Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. He was the first delegate to represent Hampshire County in both the Virginia General Assembly and the West Virginia Legislature.|$|E
50|$|She {{authored}} or co-authored multiple laws, {{including the}} toughening {{of responsibility for}} violating the rules of holding rallies, tightening immigration, criminal libel and registration requirements for 'foreign agents' for non-profit organizations with foreign funding. In 2014, she sponsored a bill prohibiting rehabilitation of Nazism. Another law known as the Yarovaya Law required in particular that telecommunications providers record all of their traffic and keep the record for three years (later shortened to six months). The first version of <b>this</b> counter-terrorism <b>bill</b> {{would have made it}} a criminal offense to fail reporting suspicious activities potentially linked with terrorism. <b>This</b> <b>bill's</b> language was subsequently watered down by the Duma.|$|R

5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although <b>this</b> <b>bill</b> failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|In {{taking his}} {{seat at the}} National Assembly in the Palais Bourbon {{alongside}} compatriots Ouezzin Coulibaly and Zinda Kaboré, Houphouët-Boigny had to first decide with which group to side, and he opted for the Mouvement Unifié de la Résistance (MUR), a small party composed of Communist sympathizers but not formal members of the Communist Party. He was appointed {{a member of the}} Commission des territoires d'outre-mer (Commission of Overseas Territories). During this time, he worked to implement the wishes of the SAA, in particular proposing a bill to abolish forced labor—the single most unpopular feature of French rule. The Assembly adopted <b>this</b> <b>bill,</b> known as Loi Houphouët-Boigny, on 11 April 1946, greatly enhancing the author's prestige not only in his country. On 3 April 1946, Houphouët-Boigny proposed to unify labour regulations in the territories of Africa; this would eventually be completed in 1952. Finally, on 27 September 1946, he filed a report on the public health system of overseas territories, calling for its reformation. Houphouët-Boigny in his parliamentary tenure supported the idea of a union of French territories.|$|E
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue {{to be decided by}} the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. President of the DPJ, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that <b>this</b> <b>bill</b> would cause further divisions among society and the public schools.|$|E
