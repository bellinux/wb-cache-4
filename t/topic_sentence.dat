Although topic {{sentences}} may appear anywhere in a paragraph, in academic essays they often appear at the beginning.The <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> acts {{as a kind of}} summary, and offers the reader an insightful view of the writer’s main ideas for the following paragraph. More than just being a mere summary, however, a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> often provides a claim or an insight directly or indirectly related to the thesis. It adds cohesion to a paper and helps organize ideas both within the paragraph and the whole body of work at large. As the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> encapsulates the idea of the paragraph, serving as a sub-thesis, it remains general enough to cover the support given in the body paragraph while being more direct than the thesis of the paper.|$|E

5000|$|English {{students}} are sometimes taught that a paragraph {{should have a}} <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> or [...] "main idea", preferably first, and multiple [...] "supporting" [...] or [...] "detail" [...] sentences which explain or supply evidence. One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, {{is known as the}} Schaffer paragraph. For example, the following excerpt from Dr. Samuel Johnson's Lives of the English Poets, the first sentence is the main idea: that Joseph Addison is a skilled [...] "describer of life and manners". The succeeding sentences are details that support and explain the main idea in a specific way.|$|E
5000|$|Pivot topic {{sentences}} {{will come}} {{somewhere in the}} middle of a paragraph, and usually announce that the content will be changing in a different direction. These are often used when there are two differing opinions about something or when two [...] "experts" [...] are being quoted or referred to that may have a different opinion or approach to something. A paragraph may begin something like this: Kubler and Kessler have identified 5 stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And they have provided a detailed explanation of the symptoms and behaviors of each of these stages, so that those experiencing grief may identify which stage they are in at any given time and develop strategies with the help of their therapists, to move through those stages more effectively. Since their original work, however, a number of other psychologists have developed different models of the grieving process that call into question some of Kubler and Kessler’s contentions…. [...] (rest of paragraph to follow).The first part of this paragraph addresses Kubler and Kessler; the second part will obviously address another opinion. The <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> is underlined, to show the pivot point in the paragraph. Pivot topic sentences will always have some clue word, such as [...] "yet," [...] "sometimes," [...] or [...] "however." ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{speakers}} and writers use linguistic devices to signal a shift of topic in their discourse. The present paper considers the comprehension function of one of these segmentation markers, namely a temporal adverbial, by studying its role in a well-established boundary effect: Reading time for the first sentence of a new discourse unit is longer than reading time for the other sentences. In four experiments, participants read short narratives in which: a target sentence was preceded by highly congruent sentences(topic continuity condition) or by weakly congruent <b>sentences</b> (<b>topic</b> shift condition). As predicted by the boundary hypothesis, <b>topic</b> shift <b>sentences</b> were read more-slowly than <b>topic</b> continuous <b>sentences.</b> However. the boundary effect disappeared when the segmentation marker was inserted {{at the beginning of the}} <b>topic</b> shift <b>sentence</b> (Experiment 1), though not at its end (Experiment 2). The third experiment showed that not just any adverbial produces this effect.

Children were trained to find the main idea in one-and two-paragraph texts and took pre- and posttests in which they were asked to write the main ideas contained in one-, and six- to eight-paragraph texts. The main ideas contained in these texts either were explicitly stated (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> first or last) or were implicit (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> missing). Children's performance improved from pre- to posttest, although the effect of <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placement was evident at both test times (performance on topic-sentence-first paragraphs was better than on topic-sentence-last paragraphs, which was, in turn, better than performance on topic-sentence-missing paragraphs). Although average achieving children and {{children with learning disabilities}} did not differ on static pre- and posttest measures, they did dif-fer in how easily they learned to find the main idea under different <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placement conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{experimental}} study aims {{to investigate the}} effect of different task variance that involves Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> and Providing Signal Words as independent variables on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence as dependent variables. Two groups {{of the first year}} students of English Department at Jambi University in Indonesia were selected as participants in this study. Each group consists of 30 students. Group I was required to perform the writing task that is provided <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> (PTS). Group II was required to perform the writing task that is provided signal words (PSW). The results of the test were rated or scored by using analytical and holistic rating systems. The data were analyzed statistically by using Independent Sample T – Test and Correlation. The findings of the study showed that on average, Group I has higher level of effect on student’s writing proficiency (M = 72. 57, SE = 1. 81) than the effect of Group II on student’s writing proficiency (M = 56. 50, SE = 2. 16). This difference is significant (t (58) = 5. 70; p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the interactions among the components of complexity have strong correlation. Then, positive relationships among the components of coherence are also statistically proved. Therefore, the null hypothesis which says that there is no effect of different task variance that involves Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> and Providing Signal Words on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence can be rejected. Based on these findings we conclude that Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> helps students much better to develop paragraph writing than Providing Signal Words. ...|$|E
