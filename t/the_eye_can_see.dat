Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E

50|$|Realism, a {{style of}} {{painting}} that depicts the actuality of what <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> was a very popular art form in France around the mid- to late-19th century. It came about {{with the introduction of}} photography - a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce things that look “objectively real”. Realism was heavily against romanticism, a genre dominating French literature and artwork in the mid-19th century. Undistorted by personal bias, Realism believed in the ideology of external reality and revolted against exaggerated emotionalism. Truth and accuracy became the goals of many realists as Gustave Courbet.|$|R

In some places they are so near together that a person on horseback may count a hundred of them from one point of view.|$|E

I had formed a finer idea of it out of [...] "Eothen." [...] Perhaps in a simoom it may look more awful. The only adventure that befell in this romantic place was that Asinus's legs went deep into a hole: whereupon his rider went over his head, and bit the sand, and measured his length there; and upon this hint rose up, and rode home again. No doubt one should have gone out for a couple of days' march--as it was, the desert did not seem to me sublime, only UNCOMFORTABLE.|$|E
