40|$|The {{productivity}} {{dimension of}} minimum wages Authorities in South Africa are currently investigating {{the issue of}} introducing a national minimum wage in the economy. “Business South Africa", {{as a representative of}} the private sector, also made proposals in this regard at the beginning of November 1995. The minimum wage debate is really not a new one and much research has already been done on the economic merits of certain aspects regarding minimum wages. However, very little, if indeed anything, has been done concerning the ethical aspect of minimum wages. This article therefore addresses the issue of minimum wages from an ethical point of view. The discussion suggests that minimum wages cannot be paid in an economy without taking into consideration the productivity levels of the workers concerned. Productivity considerations must be taken into account in the determination of the level of minimum wages, or any other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> fo r that matter. There should certainly not be any 'free lunch' - especially not in a low-productivity economy. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of labor market segmentation. People from different language groups form separate urban labor submarkets. The labor submarket {{of the majority}} group offers higher wages because this market has more firms so that workers {{are more likely to}} find jobs that match their skills. The theory implies two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> gaps. It also predicts a pattern of relationships between language group populations and wages in different labor submarkets. Using the 2001 Census of Canada Public Use Microdata File on Individuals, I find two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> gaps. The first exists between people who enter the majority group’s labor market but who belong to different language groups. The second exists between people who belong to the same language group but who enter different labor markets. In addition, the pattern <b>of</b> changes in <b>wages</b> when language group populations change is as predicted. ...|$|R

Drawing mainly on recent research by the author, this paper examines the consequences <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> indexation to lagged inflation on aggregate wage formation, the cost of disinflation under money- and exchange-rate-based stabilization, the variability of output under alternative shocks and policy regimes, the choice of exchange rate regime, and the level and variability of inflation. ...|$|R

30|$|Next, {{we explore}} {{the effect of}} unions on firms’ use <b>of</b> non-base <b>wage</b> components. Additional file  1 : Table S 4 shows that {{unionisation}} and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining have no significant effects. Moreover, different combinations and interactions of variables, sectors and collective bargaining characteristics are not significant and do not affect the main results. Thus, substitutability between base and non-base wages to overcome DNWR is not limited {{by the presence of}} unions. In fact, collective wage bargaining and coverage do not appear relevant as regards the decision to cut non-base wage components. In addition, the higher likelihood <b>of</b> adjusting non-base <b>wage</b> components when DNWR is prevalent persists no matter what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> shocks the firm is facing (see Additional file  1 : Table S 4).|$|R

30|$|We {{refer to}} wage {{subsidies}} as any transfer {{from the government}} that is able {{to reduce the cost}} of labor and/or increase take-home pay. Hence, there are many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> subsidies depending on who the payee is (employers or workers); how the transfer is made (social security contributions, taxes, or direct transfers); or eligibility and targeting criteria (all workers, new entrants, youth). There are, of course, also differences in the administrative arrangements used to implement wage subsidies (see Section 3). Regardless, wage subsidies can affect the cost of labor and take home pay and therefore the supply and demand of labor.|$|R
30|$|The {{estimated}} {{effects of}} workers’ characteristics {{are also in}} line with expectations: firms whose employees include {{a high percentage of}} white-collar workers were more likely to cut flexible wages (the difference from the baseline is 5.6 percentage points).

Neither the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> contract nor the extent of product market competition affects the use of reductions of flexible pay.|$|R
40|$|We {{show the}} effects of the {{bargaining}} power of labour unions on product innovation under decentralised and centralised wage bargaining. In this context, we show the implications of preference function, which affects the market size. A higher union bargaining power increases innovation if bargaining is decentralised, the market expansion effect is weak and the cost of innovation is moderate but low. Otherwise, a higher union bargaining power reduces innovation. Hence, whether a higher union bargaining power increases or decreases product innovation depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining, market expansion effect and the cost of innovation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to answer an often asked question: If tariff rates are reduced, {{what will happen to}} wage inequality? The authors consider two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> inequality: between occupations (skills premium) and between industries. They use two large databases <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> inequality that have recently become available and a large data set of average tariff rates covering the period between 1980 and 2000. The authors find that tariff reduction is associated with higher inter-occupational and inter-industry inequality in poorer countries (those below the world median income) and the reverse in richer countries. However, the results for inter-occupational inequality must be treated with caution.

40|$|This paper investigates wage {{dynamics}} {{assuming the}} potential presence <b>of</b> dual <b>wage</b> stickiness: {{with respect to}} both the frequency {{as well as the}} size <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> adjustments. In particular, this paper proposes a structural model <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> inflation dynamics assuming that although workers adjust wage contracts at discrete time intervals, they are limited in their abilities to adjust wages as much as they might desire. The dual wage stickiness model nests the baseline model, based on Calvo-type wage stickiness, as a particular case. Empirical results favor the dual sticky wage model over the baseline model that assumes only one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> stickiness in several dimensions. In particular, it outperforms the baseline model in terms of goodness of fitness {{as well as in the}} ability to explain the observed dynamic correlation between wage inflation and the output gap - which the baseline model fails to capture. ...|$|R
40|$|This short paper {{attempts}} {{to combine the}} shirking and turnover cost models into a composite model that captures the main features of each. Our main result is that in equilibrium, the elasticity of effort {{with respect to the}} wage will equal the elasticity of the average cost of labour with respect to the wage. This is a generalisation of earlier models since this condition simplifies to the familar Solow Condition if turnover is independent <b>of</b> the <b>wage</b> and simplifies to the condition that the wage is chosen to minimise the average cost of labour if shirking effects are absent. We provide an example that shows how the shirking and turnover cost models are complements rather than substitutes, since the impact on <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> efficiency <b>wage</b> effect is stronger when the other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> efficiency <b>wage</b> effect is also present...|$|R

The estimates also show that the unemployment rate was a strong determinant of the contract’s target real wage and that most wage negotiations were carried through during the first half of every year. The results prove robust to a variety of tests and fit the data better than standard Phillips curves. ...|$|R
