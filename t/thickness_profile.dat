40|$|A {{method of}} {{converting}} the lateral X-ray yield intensity distributions from micro-PIXE line-scans into multi-layered <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> is proposed. The method {{is demonstrated by}} the construction of multi-layered wear patterns of the flank faces of two types of TiN-coated high-speed steel (HSS) drills used in machining stainless steel workpieces.

40|$|Abstract A simple {{analytical}} model for inverse pulsed laser deposition is proposed. In the model {{the motion of}} the evaporated material is assumed to emerge as from a point source located above the surface of evaporation at some dis-tance. The obtained <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> of inverse deposited films agree well with those calculated by the test particle Monte Carlo method. The proposed approach has been ap-plied for analysis of experimental data on inverse pulsed laser deposition of graphite in nitrogen atmosphere with nanosecond pulses of laser fluences between 1 and 7 J/cm 2. The model describes well the <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> and pres-sure dependence of film growth rate for inverse deposi-tion. PACS 81. 15. Fg · 52. 38. Mf · 79. 20. Ds...|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of steady non-uniform laminar flow was attempted. The model used {{was that of}} a thin incompressible, isothermal liquid film flowing down an infinitely wide plate. Solutions predicting the film <b>thickness</b> and velocity <b>profiles</b> as a function of distance down the plate were obtained for various initial conditions. The solutions were obtained by using a form of the Mechanical Energy Equation and an approximated form of the equation of motion. The Mechanical Energy Equation was an ordinary differential equation, and as such it was solved numerically by the Modified-modified Euler method. The equation of motion was finally reduced to a linear partial differential equation and also solved numerically. From the results, a correlation for the development of velocity profiles {{as a function of the}} Reynold's number was obtained. It was found to be linear with the initial film thickness as a parameter. The velocity profiles obtained were similar in shape to those measured experimentally by Nedderman; however, it was impossible to duplicate film <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained experimentally by Ryan-Bell. Film <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> calculated by the Mechanical Energy Equation should be good approximations for a physical situation once flow has become "similar”, but no experimental data was available for comparison...|$|R

50|$|The moiré effect also occurs between {{overlapping}} transparent objects. For example, {{an invisible}} phase mask {{is made of}} a transparent polymer with a wavy <b>thickness</b> <b>profile.</b> As light shines through two overlaid masks of similar phase patterns, a broad moiré pattern occurs on a screen some distance away. This phase moiré effect and the classical moiré effect from opaque lines are two ends of a continuous spectrum in optics, which is called the universal moiré effect. The phase moiré effect {{is the basis for}} a type of broadband interferometer in x-ray and particle wave applications. It also provides a way to reveal hidden patterns in invisible layers.|$|E

40|$|The {{tribology}} of {{a bubble}} rubbing on a solid surface is studied via interferometry. A unique experimental setup {{is designed for}} monitoring the <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> of a wetting film, intercalated between the bubble and hydrophilic glass moving with speed up to 412 um/s. The determination of the 3 D film <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> allows us to calculate 3 D maps over the wetted surface of the local capillary, disjoining and lift pressures, viscous stress and friction force. In this way the average friction force and the corresponding friction coefficient are obtained. A theoretical model for the dependence of the friction coefficient on the film thickness is developed. The relevant slip coefficient, being a measure for the slip between liquid and solid, is determined {{as a function of}} the speed of the solid surface. It is found out that below 170 um/s a friction regime exists which formally resembles dry friction, while at larger speed the friction force between the bubble and solid passes through a maximum. Furthermore, the friction coefficient has a large value at low speed of the solid and reduces substantially with the speed increase...|$|R
40|$|Rotating disks {{have many}} {{applications}} in the aerospace industry such as gas turbines and gears. These disks normally work under thermo mechanical loads. Minimizing the weight of such components can help reduce the overall payload in aerospace industry. For this purpose, a rotating functionally graded (FG) disk with variable thickness under a steady temperature field is considered in this paper. Thermo elastic solutions {{and the weight of}} the disk are related to the material grading index and the geometry of the disk. It is found that a disk with parabolic or hyperbolic convergent <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> has smaller stresses and displacements compared to a uniform thickness disk. Maximum radial stress due to centrifugal load in the solid disk with parabolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> may not be at the center unlike uniform thickness disk. Functionally graded disk with variable thickness has smaller stresses due to thermal load compared to those with uniform thickness. It is seen that for a given value of grading index, the FG disk having concave <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the lightest in weight whereas the FG disk with uniform <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the heaviest. Also for any given <b>thickness</b> <b>profile,</b> the weight of the FG disk lies in between the weights of the all-metal and the all-ceramic disks...|$|E

40|$|Bitter coil is an {{electromagnet}} {{used for}} the generation of exceptionally strong magnetic fields. The upper bound of magnet flux density is restricted by several factors.

The common radial <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> of the Bitter coil is constant. In this paper the possibility of optimization by means of non-constant radial <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> of the Bitter coil is studied. The close form expression for optimal <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is obtained. Both designs are compared and the considerable improvement of magnetic flux density is demonstrated.

40|$|To {{determine}} the {{vertical and horizontal}} <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> of the corneal epithelium in vivo using ultra-long scan depth and ultra-high resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). A SD-OCT was developed with an axial resolution of ∼ 3. 3 µm in tissue and an extended scan depth. Forty-two eyes of 21 subjects were imaged twice. The entire horizontal and vertical corneal epithelial <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were evaluated. The coefficient of repeatability (CoR) and intraclass correlation (ICC) of the tests and interobserver variability were analyzed. The full width of the horizontal epithelium was detected, whereas part of the superior epithelium was not shown for the covered super eyelid. The mean central epithelial corneal thickness was 52. 0 ± 3. 2 µm for the first measurement and 52. 3 ± 3. 4 µm for the second measurement (P>. 05). In the central zone (0 - 3. 0 mm), the paracentral zones (3. 0 - 6. 0 mm) and the peripheral zones (6. 0 - 10. 0 mm), the mean epithelial thickness ranged from 51 to 53 µm, 52 to 57 µm, and 58 to 72 µm, respectively. There {{was no difference between}} the two tests at both meridians and in the right and left eyes (P>. 05). The ICCs of the two tests ranged from 0. 70 to 0. 97 and the CoRs ranged from 2. 5 µm to 7. 8 µm from the center to the periphery, corresponding to 5. 6 % to 10. 6 % (CoR%). The ICCs of the two observers ranged from 0. 72 to 0. 93 and the CoRs ranged from 4. 5 µm to 10. 4 µm from the center to the periphery, corresponding to 8. 7 % to 15. 2 % (CoR%).

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} of <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> of corneal epithelium produced by aautomatic hierarchic algorithm that {{was applied to}} images obtained by a custom-built ultra-high resolution OCT(UHR-OCT) system. METHODS: Eighteen left eyes of 18 subjects(23. 2 ± 0. 9) years; mean age±standard deviation) were imaged twice on non-consecutive days by a custom-built ultra-high resolution OCT(UHR-OCT) system. A hierarchic algorithm based on the axial gradient information and a shortest path search was developed to measure the corneal epithelial <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> from the SD-OCT images. RESULTS: There was good correlation between theautomatic and manual hierarchy positions of the epithelium(p > 0. 05, paired t -test). The average epithelial thickness of the 6 mm central corneal region determined by the automatic hierarchic algorithm was 52. 1 ± 2. 1 μm, ranging from 50. 3 ± 1. 8 μm to 53. 2 ± 2. 4 μm along the horizontal meridian. The epithelial thickness differences between automatic and manual hierarchy by the UHR-OCT systems were 0. 4 ± 0. 3 μm. The intraclass correlation coefficients(ICC) and coefficients of repeatability(CoR) with repeated UHR-OCT measurements for epithelial thickness were 0. 90 ± 0. 05 and 1. 44 ± 0. 01 μm respectively.

Some particular features relevant to each material (problems of non-congruent transfer of stoichiometry, particular <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles,</b> [...] .) are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the retinal <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> in myopic and non-myopic eyes. Methods: The retinal <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> of 30 myopic eyes [spherical equivalent error (SER) between - 6. 00 and - 13. 63 D] and 31 non-myopic eyes (SER between + 2. 75 and - 0. 50 -D) were measured using the Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Two scan types were used: the Macular Thickness Map and the Customized Line Scan for a central 80 ° horizontal retinal <b>thickness</b> <b>profile.</b> Results:- At foveal center and fovea, myopic eyes had a thicker retina than the non-myopic group (p = 0. 002 and 0. 044, respectively). At other zones of the macula, the retina was significantly thinner in myopic eyes compared to non-myopic eyes (p < 0. 01, unpaired t-test). From 40 ° nasal to 40 ° temporal retina, a general reduction of retinal thickness was observed across the myopic retina {{compared to the}} non-myopic retina except at 20 ° nasal to fixation. Conclusions:- There was general reduction in retinal thickness within the horizontal central 80 ° in myopic eyes compared with non-myopic eyes. School of Optometr...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} gas forming is a tubular component forming technology with pressurized gas at elevated temperature, based on QPF, HMGF and Hydroforming. This {{process can be}} used to form tube blank at lower temperatures with high energy efficiency and also at higher strain rates. With Ti- 3 Al- 2. 5 V Ti-alloy tube, the potential of HPGF was studied further through experiments at the elevated temperatures of 650 [*]∘C and 700 [*]∘C. In order to know the formability of the Ti-alloy tube, tensile tests were also carried out. The results show that: at the temperatures of 650 [*]∘C and 700 [*]∘C, the flow curves exhibit the power-law constitutive relation until peak stress is reached and the deformability is suitable for the HPGF process of Ti- 3 Al- 2. 5 V alloy tube. The effects of pressurization path on the corner filling process and <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> are obvious. The high pressure inflow process can result in temperature difference between the straight wall area and corner area, which makes the <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> special. Besides, with the stepped pressurization path, the more constant filling rate and better <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out by monitoring the in-situ pressure and <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> for three different configurations, viz., flat plate, flat plate with a central circular hole, and an L-section using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. The effect of anisotropy on resin flow has been quantified by considering uni-directional carbon fiber preforms with 0 degrees and 90 degrees orientation to the flow direction for each configuration. A quasi-isotropic 45 degrees/ 0 degrees/- 45 degrees/ 90 degrees](S) layup has also been included for flat plate case. Additionally, the study has been extended to understand the effect of using high permeability medium for each configuration. Fluid pressure <b>profiles</b> and <b>thickness</b> variation <b>profiles</b> have been obtained using an array of pressure sensors and linear variable differential transformers for each configuration. Experimental data reveal that anisotropy (due to changing fiber orientations), configuration, and gravity significantly change fluid pressure and displacement fields obtained during VARTM...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Jan. 17, 2014 - Jan. 17, 2016 Flexible electronics processing techniques were applied to integrate a glucose sensor with a hormone-delivery catheter {{in order to create}} a cheap and minimally invasive method for patients with type 1 diabetes to continually monitor and control their blood sugar levels. Ultimately, this work intends to move toward the development of a complete artificial pancreas. The theory, development, and optimization of a process to fabricate these sensors/catheters is discussed along with electrical and mechanical characterization of the resulting devices. Experiments performed in the process of device development are presented, including data indicating that aluminum oxide deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD) may not be suitable for application in flexible devices intended to withstand extreme curvature. As an additional topic, a model of ALD in porous materials is presented as applied to deposition of aluminum oxide in carbon nanocrystal (CNC) aerogels. Aerogel geometry was modeled as a simple three-dimensional cubic network of cylinders, and recently published modeling techniques were applied to generate expected <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> of ALD alumina as a function of depth into an aerogel sample. Modeled <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were generally found to agree with experimental observations, suggesting the usefulness of this model for ALD in aerogels and other complex porous geometries...|$|R

The measured film <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> are compared to predictions from a lubrication model. This model has been extended to two dimensions so that the surface contours around features of any width and length may be calculated, and preliminary results are reported. Profile asymmetry, or "pile-up", is caused by surface tension forces near {{the edges of the}} feature that accelerate flow where the channel (the film thickness) narrows and retard flow where the film thickness widens. 1...|$|R
