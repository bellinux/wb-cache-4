5|$|Standard gear {{includes}} climate control, Blaupunkt sound, cruise control, full trip computer, rear park assist, <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> Electronic Stability Control, power {{mirrors and}} windows. The oil, voltage and temperature gauges are now digital. The interior offers {{a choice of}} light urban beige, white or black for the colours. The carpets remain dark as in the Holden Calais V-Series. The Senator Signature also offers a number of options such as a roof mounted DVD player, front park assist, rain sensing wipers and door entry lamps. Satellite navigation will become available as an option in the near future.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and <b>Traction</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
25|$|Also new for the 1971 was an {{optional}} MaxTrac computerized <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{details on}} the <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> used in motoGP and by BMW, in our knowledge, are not available. <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are not used in other {{commercial}} motorcycles or in supermotard or motocross motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> which restore <b>traction</b> if driven wheels {{begin to}} spin ...|$|R
50|$|Automobile {{manufacturers}} {{state in}} vehicle manuals that <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> should not encourage dangerous driving or encourage driving in conditions beyond the driver's control.|$|R
25|$|Electronic Stability Control ("Dynamic Stability Control") introduced, {{replacing}} the previous ASC+T <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E
25|$|Other advancements {{on the car}} {{include the}} {{clutchless}} direct shift technology within the gearbox, a new fluid <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to replace the previous 2001 <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> and upright aerodynamically shaped periscopic exhaust outlets at the rear. The latter technology was incorporated both to use the hot exhaust gases for aerodynamic effect and to raise these gases higher and out {{the way of the}} rear suspension. On previous occasion Ferrari's non chimneyed top exiting exhaust outlets had caused the rear suspension and other elements {{at the rear of the}} car to overheat or even melt when minor cracks occurred.|$|E
50|$|Rear-wheel {{drive or}} all-wheel drive have {{conventional}} open-type differentials {{with a choice}} of axle ratios. <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> both mechanical and electronic, are optional.|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{share the}} {{electrohydraulic}} brake actuator (which {{does not use}} the conventional master cylinder and servo) and wheel speed sensors with ABS.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Toyota {{introduced}} {{their first}} <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> works by applying individual wheel braking and throttle to keep traction while accelerating but, unlike the ESC, {{it is not}} designed to aid in steering.|$|R
25|$|In July 1992, the SC 300, a smaller-engined {{version of}} the SC 400, premiered in the United States. The SC 300 was {{equipped}} with a 3.0L inline 6 2JZ-GE. Lexus' <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> TRAC, was offered as an option.|$|E
25|$|ABS {{equipment}} {{may also}} be used to implement a <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (TCS) on acceleration of the vehicle. If, when accelerating, the tire loses traction, the ABS controller can detect the situation and take suitable action so that traction is regained. More sophisticated versions of this can also control throttle levels and brakes simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Since initial {{widespread}} use in production cars, anti-lock braking {{systems have been}} improved considerably. Recent versions not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but also electronically control the front-to-rear brake bias. This function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known as electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> emergency brake assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 and 1996 stock {{have similar}} bodyshells, but they use {{different}} AC <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> more modern on 1995 stock since the 1996 stock design spec was 'frozen' in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The Terrex AV82 was {{developed}} in 2005 equipped with a more advanced driveline and hydro-pneumatic suspension system. Development of this driveline involving new <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and rear wheel steering continues.|$|R
25|$|All models come {{standard}} with side torso airbags, {{side curtain}} airbags, anti-lock braking and electronic brakeforce distribution. For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability <b>Control</b> and <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> became standard.|$|R
25|$|Anti-lock {{braking system}} (ABS) and <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (TCS) (referred to as TCL on FTOs) {{can also be}} found as factory-fitted options on some earlier models such as the sports GX model. An easy-visual check for fitment of ABS to an FTO is to look in the engine bay - an alloy block, with six brake pipes emerging, will be present behind the battery and down against the bulkhead. ABS was {{standard}} equipment on facelift models.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{incorporates}} {{yaw rate}} control into the {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS). Yaw is a rotation around the vertical axis; i.e. spinning left or right. Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (TCS or ASR), which senses drive-wheel slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or Traction Control.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, Toyota began {{extensive}} offroad evaluations of the FJ platform by driving development mules {{on many of the}} most difficult trails in North America, including Moab, Utah, the Angeles National Forest, the Mojave Desert, and the Rubicon Trail. Despite each one-off mule costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, the development team was determined to push the capabilities of the prototypes in order to deliver reliable offroad performance in the production model. Changes to the A-TRAC <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and suspension tuning came {{as a direct result of}} the prototype testing.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 and 1996 {{stocks have}} similar body shells but they use {{different}} AC <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> The 1995 stock system is more modern, since the 1996 stock design specification was frozen in 1991.|$|R
30|$|Conti et al. {{describe}} {{a solution for}} <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> for motocross and supermotard motorcycles. <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> for four-wheel vehicles and some heavy road motorcycles are widely used, but not for small motorcycles. The authors present an algorithm and a low-cost real-time hardware implementation as a prototype.|$|R
25|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} drive-by-wire electronic throttle, a five-speed automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist {{as well as}} electronic stability and <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> The fourth-generation Lexus ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.|$|R
25|$|At the San Marino Grand Prix, both Senna and Roland Ratzenberger {{suffered}} fatal accidents. After {{the race}} weekend, the FIA asked {{the teams that}} finished first, second and third in the race (Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren respectively) to provide copies of their engine management system source code to see if an undetected <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was stored in there to gain an illegal advantage. Ferrari supplied the code immediately, but McLaren and Benetton only handed over the code after the FIA's deadline, {{for which they were}} fined $100,000.|$|E
25|$|The EV1 was {{not only}} used to {{showcase}} the electric powertrain, but also premiered a number of features and technologies that would later find their way onto more common GM models and other manufacturers' cars. The EV1 {{was among the first}} production vehicles to utilize aluminum {{in the construction of the}} frame. The car's body panels were made of plastic rather than metal, making the car lightweight and dent resistant. The vehicle was fitted with Anti-lock brakes and a <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Comfort improvements included a keyless entry and ignition system, a special one-way thermal glass for better heat rejection on sunny days, an automated tire pressure loss warning system, electric power steering, and a time-programmable HVAC system.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E
50|$|The car's {{suspension}} features double wishbones at {{the front}} and a multi-link setup at the rear, coupled with E-Diff and F1-Trac <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> designed to improve the car's cornering and longitudinal acceleration by 32% when compared with its predecessors.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} drive-by-wire electronic throttle, a five-speed automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist {{as well as}} electronic stability and <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> The fourth-generation Lexus ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.|$|R
5000|$|In road cars: <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> has {{traditionally}} been a safety feature in premium high-performance cars, which otherwise need sensitive throttle input to prevent spinning driven wheels when accelerating, especially in wet, icy or snowy conditions. In recent years, <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> have become widely available in non-performance cars, minivans, and light trucks and in some small hatchbacks.|$|R
25|$|Räikkönen and Heidfeld took {{seventh and}} ninth {{positions}} respectively for Sauber; Räikkönen {{was satisfied with}} his starting position as he made small changes to the handling balance of his C20 chassis, whilst Heidfeld was held up by Ralf Schumacher and both McLarens who were driving slowly in the final section of the track, causing Heidfeld to go up across an inside kerb and onto grass which lost him three-tenths of a second. The two Saubers were sandwiched by Montoya in the faster Williams who bent a push-rod on his first run after clipping the kerb at the exit of Becketts corner and took over the spare car set up for Ralf Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten qualifiers and said he felt unlucky as his fastest lap was set on his second run and was held up by traffic when track conditions had improved. Panis recorded the eleventh fastest lap time and reported the balance of his car was good but {{had a problem with}} his <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> which was quickly rectified by his engineers. Villeneuve had an engine problem on his first run and went into the spare BAR monocoque until his race car was fixed and was twelfth fastest. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Jaguars and did not report any problems. Alesi found the old version of his Prost's undertray gave him more consistent handling and recorded the 14th fastest lap. Irvine qualified in 15th position and had a suspension failure and switched to the spare Jaguar which was set-up for de la Rosa. Burti had a large amount of understeer which restricted him to 16th on the grid. Verstappen gradually improved his car throughout the session and secured 17th place; his team-mate Bernoldi took the 20th position and had a throttle issue on his first run which affected his momentum and was held up by Verstappen on his final run. The two Arrows were separated by the Benetton's of Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella; Button was unable to record a faster lap time because he was held up by traffic and Fisichella complained of understeer and poor grip. Alonso secured 21st and completed the grid. His team-mate Tarso Marques failed to set a lap within 107% of Michael Schumacher's pole time and was not allowed to start the race after an appeal by Minardi was rejected by the stewards.|$|E
2500|$|... 1973–present Mercedes-Benz S-Class – Seat belt pretensioner, and {{electronic}} <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The above systems {{ending with}} [...] "#" [...] {{function}} by selectively using the <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (via ABS) to brake a slipping wheel.|$|E
50|$|Extensive safety {{measures}} were also {{integrated into the}} project: {{in addition to the}} progressive deformation structure and central passenger cell which help to cushion impact, it was also equipped with twin front airbags, side airbags, Antilock Braking <b>System,</b> Electronic Stability <b>Control</b> and <b>Traction</b> <b>Control</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wheel slide {{protection}} and wheel slip protection are railway terms {{used to describe}} automatic systems used to detect and prevent wheel-slide during braking or wheel-slip during acceleration. This is analogous to ABS and <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> used on motor vehicles. It is particularly important in slippery rail conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessor}} {{of modern}} electronic <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be found}} in high-torque, high-power rear-wheel drive cars as a limited slip differential. A limited slip differential is a purely mechanical system that transfers a relatively small amount of power to the non-slipping wheel, while still allowing some wheel spin to occur.|$|R
