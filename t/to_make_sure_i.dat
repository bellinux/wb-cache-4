In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would not be eligible?

500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25.

Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> was compos mentis".
