40|$|During a six {{year period}} <b>the</b> Jesus <b>Seminar</b> {{evaluated}} 1, 544 versions of 518 different sayings. The {{goal was to}} determine the authenticity of these sayings according to various degrees of historical reliability. The results constitute Phase One of <b>the</b> <b>Seminar's</b> efforts, and have since been published as The Five Gospels: The Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus (1993). Although <b>the</b> Jesus <b>Seminar</b> has undertaken three more Phases, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine and evaluate only the first Phase. Part One, "Evaluating <b>the</b> Jesus <b>Seminar's</b> Work in Phase One," consists of two chapters. Chapter 1, "Phase One of <b>the</b> Jesus <b>Seminar's</b> Work," considers <b>the</b> beginnings of <b>the</b> Jesus <b>Seminar,</b> <b>the</b> two goals for Phase One, four motivations, methodologies, and the voting outcomes of the semiannual meetings. Chapter 2, "The Jesus Seminar and Its Critics," surveys the many objections that have been raised about <b>the</b> <b>Seminar's</b> work. In particular, scholars have challenged <b>the</b> <b>Seminar's</b> assumptions, methodologies, and results. Part Two, "Evaluating <b>the</b> Jesus <b>Seminar's</b> Quest for <b>the</b> Historical Jesus," likewise consists of two chapters. In chapter 3, "The Jesus <b>Seminar</b> and <b>the</b> Tradition of Quests," the various quests for the historical Jesus are surveyed, specifically, the Old Quest, the New Quest, and the Third Quest. <b>The</b> Jesus <b>Seminar's</b> quest finds its closest analogy in the Old Quest for the historical Jesus. Chapter 4, "A Modest Proposal for a Limited Quest," proposes a quest for the historical Jesus, albeit a limited quest. The limitation to the quest is largely due to the methodology employed, namely, historical criticism. In this chapter, the three steps of this method, i. e., research, synthesis, and implications, are delineated and evaluated for contributions and limitations...|$|R
