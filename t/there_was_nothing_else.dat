25|$|The di Marcos are now deemed as {{something}} of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody really knew {{what to do with the}} di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it was as if they'd never been".|$|E
500|$|Boito was overjoyed, and Verdi {{reported}} {{that he was still}} working on the opera. The two men met in October or November 1891, after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter. They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello, but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: [...] "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [...] incredible that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to do but stop the entire project". Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.|$|E
500|$|Takechi's come-back {{films of}} the 1980s were all in a {{theatrical}} hardcore style. Released during {{the dawn of the}} AV, or adult video, and the height of Nikkatsu's softcore Roman porno films, his films fit into neither style. Jasper Sharp writes, [...] "His big-budget pornos came from a different world to that of the pink and Roman Porno films. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> like them at the time, and consequently they had little influence on domestically-produced sex films. Takechi died of pancreatic cancer the following year, on 26 July 1988. Without a major studio's backing or interest from the general pink film community, Takechi's name and films faded into obscurity in Japan. In 2006 his career {{was the subject of a}} full retrospective showing in Tokyo's Image Forum in 2006.|$|E

500|$|David Leitch {{directed}} a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which {{was believed to}} be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to [...] "make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to say, because we had said it." [...] Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films.|$|E
500|$|The band {{were joined}} by {{familiar}} figures such as Dick Parry and Snowy White, but relations within the band became fraught. [...] Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over. [...] On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. [...] The size of the venues was also an issue; in Chicago, the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000 person regular capacity of the Soldier Field stadium (after which ticket sales should have been ended), but Waters and O'Rourke were suspicious. [...] They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000. [...] The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who {{felt that they had}} by now achieved the success they originally sought, and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> they could look forward to. [...] In July 1977 – on the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium – a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only person who felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, as Gilmour refused to perform a third encore. [...] Waters later spoke with producer Bob Ezrin and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience. [...] The spitting incident would later form the basis of a new concept, which would eventually become one of the band's most successful album releases, The Wall.|$|E

2500|$|The 6600 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} supercomputer, outperforming everything then available by a wide margin.

[...] When other companies (namely IBM) attempted to create machines with similar performance, they stumbled (Stretch/IBM 7030). Indeed, the 6600 solved a critical design problem — [...] "imprecise interrupts" [...] — that was largely responsible for IBM's failure. He did this by replacing I/O interrupts with a polled request issued by one of 10 so-called peripheral processors, which were built-in mini-computers that did all transfers {{in and out of}} the 6600's central memory. He then further increased the challenge in the later-released 5-fold faster CDC 7600.|$|E

2500|$|One of Delta State's {{most notable}} sports coaches was (Lily) Margaret Wade (1912–1995). Wade {{played on the}} {{basketball}} team for Delta State, but the school dropped the sport when she was 19. The school claimed the sport was [...] "too strenuous for young ladies". Wade responded, [...] "We cried and burned out uniforms but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> we could do." [...] Basketball was revived in 1973, and Wade was asked to coach the team. She coached the women's basketball team to three consecutive AIWA national championships and a 93–4 record, including a 51-game winning streak, at the time, the longest winning streak in women's college basketball. Wade {{was elected to the}} Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985. Today, the Division I women's basketball player of the year receives the Margaret Wade Trophy.|$|E
2500|$|By 09:00 on 25 October, {{the wind}} was rising towards gale strength. [...] Ledbetter was having {{difficulty}} keeping Cedar on station, and the smaller rescue boats that had run for shelter {{on the evening of}} the 24th were unable to return to the reef. [...] Ledbetter decided he would try to anchor Cedar about 500 yards downwind of the reef, shoot a line to Sophia (possibly using a Lyle gun), and then evacuate the passengers by breeches buoy. [...] This would have been extremely hazardous {{and it would have been}} unlikely that over 300 people could be removed by this method, but it seemed the only thing that could be done. [...] Ledbetter twice tried to drop anchor, but each time it failed to catch on the bottom. [...] Locke could see this effort was failing, and radioed to Ledbetter that it was no use, they would have to wait for low tide when perhaps conditions might be better.

2500|$|By 0530 on 6 June 1944, {{the first}} wave of attackers {{approached}} the beach, the 741 Tank Battalion (Duplex drive (DD) Sherman amphibious tanks destined for the eastern half of Omaha were guided by LCC-20). At 0542, {{the first wave}} was dispatched. At 0641 PC-552 reported to [...] that the entire first wave foundered. The waves were too high and many DDs destined for Omaha were swamped and sank while still well off shore. On other beaches the commanders realized the danger and brought their DDs much closer inshore before launching allowing them to reach the shore. PC-552 spent the next 45 minutes picking up survivors, but watched many of the soldiers drown in front of them, helpless to do anything about them. Crewmen Ted Guzda described the scene saying, [...] "We were the control vessel for {{the first wave of}} the invasion, they all went down, we picked up all the survivors and threw them on deck." [...] Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "Later we had to sink most of ," [...] he said. [...] "We took off whatever identification they had, put weights on them and sank them. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> we could do." [...] Some soldiers were so weak from exposure, sailors from PC-552 were required to be lowered by rope to the water to place ropes around the soldiers to pull them from the water. Those soldiers did not have the strength to raise their arms to grab hold of the rope.|$|E

2500|$|Until 1944, {{there were}} only 23 Halifax bombers {{committed}} to supplying Resistance groups for all of Europe, and many in the SOE preferred that resistance groups in Yugoslavia, Italy and Greece be armed rather than in France. On 16 April 1943, the SOE agent Odette Sansom was arrested together with her fellow SOE agent and lover Peter Churchill by the Abwehr Captain Hugo Bleicher. After her arrest, Sansom was tortured for several months, which she recounted in the 1949 book Odette: The Story of a British Agent, and most notably she was not [...] "broken", refusing to talk. Sansom later recalled about her captivity in the Fresnes prison in Paris:"In those places the only thing one could try to keep was a certain dignity. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else.</b> And one could have a little dignity and try to prove that one had a little spirit and, I suppose, that kept one going. When everything else was too difficult, too bad, then one was inspired by so many things-people; perhaps a phrase one would remember that one had heard a long time before, or even a piece of poetry {{or a piece of}} music." [...] On 26 May 1943, Moulin chaired in Paris a secret meeting attended by representatives of all the main resistance groups to form the CNR (Conseil National de la Résistence-National Council of the Resistance). With the National Council of the Resistance, resistance activities started to become more co-ordinated across France. In June 1943, a sabotage campaign was started against the French rail system. Between June 1943-May 1944, the Resistance damaged 1, 822 trains, destroyed 200 passenger cars, damaged about 1, 500 passenger cars, destroyed about 2, 500 freight cars and damaged about 8,000 freight cars.|$|E
