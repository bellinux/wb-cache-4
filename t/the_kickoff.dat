5|$|With no {{time left}} {{to mount an}} {{answering}} drive, Boston College received <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> and let time run out. Heading into halftime, the two teams were tied, 1616.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} quarter, any hope of victory was {{seemingly}} out of reach for Virginia Tech. Three quick plays after <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> resulted in a first down before time ran out, but at {{the end of the}} third quarter, Florida State still had a 273 lead.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>kickoffs</b> {{are now at}} the 35-yard line {{rather than}} the 30-yard line, to match the NFL's rule changing.|$|R
50|$|McGaffie {{returned}} <b>the</b> opening <b>kickoff</b> 86 {{yards for}} a touchdown. It was <b>the</b> first <b>kickoff</b> return for a touchdown for Mizzou since Jeremy Maclin did it in 2008. It's the first time Mizzou has returned <b>the</b> opening <b>kickoff</b> for a touchdown since Roger Wehrli went 96 {{yards for a}} score against Iowa State in 1967.|$|R
50|$|Payout to {{each team}} {{depends on the}} amount of revenue gained in excess of <b>the</b> <b>Kickoff's</b> $5.5 million budget. In 2008, Clemson and Alabama were both {{expected}} to receive more than $2 million.|$|R
5|$|Surviving {{members of}} the 1958 Bulls team were invited to the 2009 International Bowl and were honored before the game. The Reverend Jesse Jackson spoke at <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> luncheon prior to the game, paying tribute to {{the legacy of the}} 1958 team.|$|E
5|$|The score {{came with}} 11seconds {{remaining}} and gave Virginia Tech its final lead, 3016. With {{no chance to}} win, Boston College elected to let the clock run out after receiving <b>the</b> <b>kickoff.</b> Virginia Tech won the 2007 ACC Championship, 3016.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{proceeded}} to trade possessions, with no side {{able to gain}} an advantage over the other's defense. Tech received <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> from Georgia, but was again hampered by penalties after earning a first down. After the Virginia Tech punt, Georgia went three-and-out, punting to the Hokies, who also went three-and-out.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Packers <b>kickoff</b> <b>the</b> {{season at}} home against their {{division}} rival, the Minnesota Vikings and came away with a 16-10 victory to improve to 1-0.|$|R

50|$|Garrett's {{touchdown}} {{tied the}} game 10-10 {{with less than}} 2 {{minutes left in the}} half, but the tie did not last long; Fulton Walker returned <b>the</b> ensuing <b>kickoff</b> a Super Bowl-record 98 yards for a touchdown to give the Dolphins a 17-10 lead. It was <b>the</b> first <b>kickoff</b> return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history, and <b>the</b> longest <b>kickoff</b> return in postseason history, breaking the prior record of 97 yards by Vic Washington in 1972.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>kickoff,</b> Florida State went three-and-out and punted back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies {{began their}} second {{possession}} of the quarter at their 39-yard line and started the drive with five consecutive running plays, advancing 28 yards in the process. Tech then switched to its passing offense, throwing four consecutive passes. Three were complete, and the final one, a 21-yard toss from Taylor to Wilson, ended with the running back carrying {{the ball into the}} end zone. The score capped a nine-play, 61-yard drive that grew the Hokies' advantage to 18 points, 35–17.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>kickoff,</b> Virginia Tech's offense again {{failed to}} advance the ball. After a three-and-out, the Hokies again punted. The ball {{traveled}} 44yards, forcing the Eagles to start at their own 21-yard line. As the quarter came to a close, the Eagles drove the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Boston College led 70.|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after <b>the</b> <b>kickoff,</b> Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
50|$|On <b>the</b> second-half <b>kickoff,</b> Jacoby Jones fielded {{the kick}} and {{promptly}} returned it 108 yards {{for the longest}} play in Super Bowl history. It broke the previous 104-yard record for <b>the</b> longest <b>kickoff</b> return in <b>the</b> playoffs (set by Trindon Holliday of the Denver Broncos in the divisional playoff game earlier that year against Baltimore), and it tied an NFL record already held by Jones and shared with Ellis Hobbs and Randall Cobb for <b>the</b> longest <b>kickoff</b> return. With <b>the</b> extra point, Baltimore was now leading 28-6.|$|R
50|$|Coleman {{was also}} a talented special teams player. Against Michigan in 1951, he tackled the Michigan kick {{returner}} on the nine yard line on <b>the</b> opening <b>kickoff.</b> Against Ohio State that same year, he tackled the return man at the seven yard line on <b>the</b> opening <b>kickoff.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> to the Tech 29-yard line, and the Yellow Jackets began the first offensive drive of the half. Jones opened the drive with a 16-yard run, then the Yellow Jackets converted a fourth down to continue down the field. Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Because Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Following <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> and return, Virginia Tech began at its 19-yard line. On the first play of the second half, Oxendine broke loose for a 36-yard run to the Nebraska 45-yard line and a first down. Despite that strong opening play, Tech was unable to gain another first down {{and was forced to}} punt after gaining only two additional yards. The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the Nebraska 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball off <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> {{on their own}} 28-yard line. Losing eightyards on their threeplays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the ball back {{with less than a}} minute left in the quarter and completed twopasses, moving the ball 13yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.|$|E

5|$|East Carolina took <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> on the 39–yard line, after a Boise player {{illegally}} {{touched the}} ball on the 39. Pinkney threw an incomplete pass to start the drive, and after two more plays failed to convert the first down, ECU was forced to punt the ball away. After a touchback, Boise State began at its 20–yard line. The Broncos completed three plays for 11yards before the third quarter ended.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{entered the}} game to guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to run out the clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following <b>the</b> <b>kickoff,</b> Glennon was intercepted {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15yards before going out of bounds.|$|E

5|$|Sewanee {{followed}} {{the defeat of}} Georgia with a 32–0 victory over Georgia Tech on the following Monday. Sewanee won easily, the first score coming soon after <b>the</b> <b>kickoff</b> on a blocked kick recovered by Quintard Gray. Gray scored the next touchdown on a 25-yard end run. Just fifteen minutes had passed when Diddy Seibels scored the third touchdown. The next three touchdowns were also scored by Seibels, including pretty runs of 35 and 40 yards. The team played its substitutes in the second half.|$|E
5|$|The game {{started with}} Maryland {{receiving}} <b>the</b> <b>kickoff,</b> which Kenny Tate returned 17yards to the Terrapins' 35-yard line. Quarterback Chris Turner threw a short pass to Torrey Smith, bringing {{the ball to}} the Maryland 41-yard line, and then threw an incomplete pass. On third down with three yards to go, Turner connected with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard touchdown pass. However, placekicker Obi Egekeze missed the extra point.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>kickoff</b> team {{started the}} {{year on a}} sour note after {{allowing}} returns of 105 and 108 yards against the Cardinals and Seahawks, but was able to allow just one return of at least 40 yards in the next thirteen games, while also forcing opponents to return an average of 25.2 yards, which ranked 21st in the league. For the punting unit, despite allowing 64- and 65-yard returns against Seattle and Minnesota, opposing return teams recorded 7.5 yards, 14th in the NFL. Sherrick McManis led the special teams unit in tackles with eleven.|$|E
50|$|The Badgers {{made the}} quickest {{score in the}} history of college football. In <b>the</b> opening <b>kickoff,</b> <b>the</b> Leathernecks kick {{returner}} stepped out of the end zone before returning and taking a knee the end zone for a safety. One second had elapsed off the clock.|$|R
