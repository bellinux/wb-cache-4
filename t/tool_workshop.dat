Ben Marwick's study of Tham Lod {{found that there}} were a considerable amount of stone artifacts which supports that humans occupied the area at an estimated minimum number of 1722 artifacts. In fact, for the most of Tham Lod there were indications that the area was primarily an ancient <b>tool</b> <b>workshop.</b> The materials that may have been utilized to make the tools found were sandstone, quartzite, mudstone, andesite, siltstone, and slate; these tools included chopper-chopping tools, scrapers, sumatraliths, short-axes, disks, and utilized flakes. Despite the different amount of tools that were made, there were other variations in stone artifacts from different layers may have a correlation to trade activity among the humans that once lived in Tham Lod.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{creating}} the draft of stamping <b>tool</b> <b>workshop</b> layout. Our first task was to define the product range.

The paper further discusses the need of human resources as well as the needs of the production, administrative and social areas. We propose possible technological solutions considering the range of production, the amount of machinery and personnel capacities. The next step is to optimize the layout, using tools such as material flow and continuity of operations. Not only safety at work but also the ergonomics of the proposed workplace is important for the final draft. The result of our project is to develop the final layout of stamping <b>tool</b> <b>workshop</b> containing the economic evaluation of the investment plan...|$|E
40|$|GE Healthcare {{wants to}} {{investigate}} whether additive manufacturing would be an alternative method in their workshops in the Umeå plant. Additive manufacturing is called 3 D printing in everyday language and manufactures details by building them up layer by layer in an automated machine. The purpose of this work is therefore to investigate how mature additive manufacturing methods are and how they could be used at GE. The work has been divided into three parts. The first section investigates how additive manufacturing would work in the production workshop at GE. The production workshop mainly consists of CNC manufacturing. The other part that is being investigated is how additive manufacturing would work in The <b>Tool</b> <b>Workshop</b> at GE. The <b>Tool</b> <b>Workshop</b> produces toolsets and fixtures for the the production at GE. The Tools Workshop today uses both manual manufacturing as lathes, milling machines and drills, and CNC manufacturing. The {{last part of the}} work investigates how additive manufacturing as a production method would work at GE. What are the environmental and health risks that may be applicable, the post-processing methods that are relevant, and how quality assurance should be made on additive manufactured parts. The study results show that additive manufacturing would be a great compliment in both workshops. In the production workshop additive manufacturing could be especially beneficial for details that do not have any specific requirements, such as surface tolerances or regulatory requirements. Additive manufacturing would also be useful as a backup method of details that are not delivered on time or otherwise not functioning as intended. The <b>Tool</b> <b>Workshop</b> could create additive manufacturing tools and fixtures with complex geometries and in one piece quantities. This would be benificial because it’s much faster to produce these kinds of details in an additive manufacturing than with CNC manufacturing or manual manufacturing. The results of the study also show that the health risks of additive manufacturing is material- related and that carefulness should be applied not to inhale powders, nano-particles or fumes from the material. The waste products may be either {{come in the form of}} breaking away parts or emissions. Emissions should then be handled in the same way as emissions are managed today. What post-processing method that is current for additively manufactured parts depends on the material to be used. Before choice of materials are made the manufacturer should keep this in mind. Since additive manufacturing can create complex parts measure instument that can verify the details are necessary. One proposal of instrument is a laser scanner. The largest delimitations made during the work are: The project does not consider geometries of details. The methods mentioned are the main methods that exist. In Tools Workshop assumed that from a specific additive manufacturing method. In the investigating part post processing, quality-, safety-, and environmental aspects in the use of additive manufacturing are investigating two different additive manufacturing methods. ...|$|E
