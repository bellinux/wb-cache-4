25|$|The {{majority}} of the information available {{on the subject of}} SGCs comes from research which was focused on the sensory neurons that the SGCs surround rather than the SGCs themselves. In the future, researchers plan to give more time and attention to the SGCs, which have many supportive and protective functions essential for life. Neurotransmitter and hormone receptors on SGCs in situ rather than in culture will likely be explored and definitively characterized. Changes in the receptors caused by various mutations and diseases will also be explored in order <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of these conditions. Additionally, the mechanisms behind neuronal-SGC communication is essentially unidentified, though {{it is likely that the}} various receptors both the neurons and SGCs have are used for chemical signaling, perhaps with P2Y.

Finally, the possibility of an influence of SGCs on synaptic transmission within autonomic ganglia provides another direction for future research.|$|E
