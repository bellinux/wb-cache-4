This Gothic masterpiece, {{in the form of a}} triptych, was made by Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri between 1337 and 1338. It shows 24 scenes of the life of Christ and eight stories about the corporal.|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} the basse-taille enamel areas began by marking {{the outline of the}} design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a [...] "tracer". Then the interior area was worked with chasing tools, hammering and punching rather than cutting, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> was added; the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel,</b> or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. In these last-mentioned areas cutting tools were used. Most of the background outside the enamelled areas was decorated in the same way. After the enamel was added and fired the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, including removing by scraping any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.|$|E
500|$|The enamel lies {{flush with}} the gold surfaces; it was a {{preparation}} of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. Different colours of enamel meet {{each other with a}} neat boundary, which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of gum tragacanth before adding the next. The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour {{around the edges of the}} tinted area. This is especially used on [...] "flux", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin. The rouge clair or [...] "ruby glass" [...] red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of copper, silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished {{flush with the}} surrounding metal. The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans (see the Lycurgus Cup, also in the British Museum), but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17thcentury. The added cylinders use opaque enamel, except for the red on the Tudor roses, which is translucent rouge clair, of a similar composition to the original reds. <b>Translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare.|$|E

50|$|Safed Chalwan {{is a kind}} {{of white}} <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> used for encrusting gems and {{precious}} stones for making jewels.

50|$|The revived {{technique}} {{was used in}} the 17th century for the covers and faces of pocket watches, gold boxes and similar items, but mostly with opacque enamel, achieving a rather different effect from medieval examples using <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel.</b> The French watchmaker Josias Jolly made frequent use of it.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} was rediscovered in the 17th century, {{but was not}} much practiced thereafter.

[...] The center of each cross is set with a painted miniature of respectively the Grand Duchess Olga and the Grand Duchess Tatiana in their Red Cross uniforms. The front cross with the portrait of Tatiana serves as a clasp, securing the double opening doors. The front of the egg divides into two quarters when opened, reveals a triptych within.|$|R
50|$|The reliquary is {{considered}} to be important artistically also because it contains the earliest extant painted <b>translucent</b> <b>enamels.</b> Thirty-two scenes in painted enamels represent the Stories of the Corporal and the Passion of Christ, created with a very contemporary style. Elaborate architectural sections, moving gothic lines, and great attention to fine detail show a strong affinity to panel painting of the era, including to artists like Simone Martini as well as the contemporary artists Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. With a taste even more markedly gothic it is a fundamental example of pictorial art of the Sienese school. Blue is the dominant background color from which stand out points of brilliant yellow, green, and red which render the scenes perfectly legibile.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} can be {{used with}} both translucent and opaque enamel, but more commonly the later; <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> is mostly found on reliefs using ronde bosse, such as a plaque with the Entombment of Christ in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. [...] In the works from around 1400, the recently developed white enamel usually predominates.|$|E

50|$|Basse-taille (bahss-tah-ee) is an {{enamelling}} {{technique in}} which the artist creates a low-relief pattern in metal, usually silver or gold, by engraving or chasing. The entire pattern is created {{in such a way}} that its highest point is lower than the surrounding metal. A <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> is then applied to the metal, allowing light to reflect from the relief and creating an artistic effect. It was used in the late Middle Ages, and then again in the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|The cross was {{probably}} made somewhere in southern Italy. Early Byzantine enamels before 726 used a filigree technique, but cloisonné became dominant later. The shade of <b>translucent</b> green <b>enamel</b> {{used as a}} body colour indicates a date between 843, when iconoclasm ended in Byzantium, to the mid tenth century.|$|R
5000|$|The de Court dynasty of enamel {{painters}} ran {{a workshop}} making Limoges enamel over several generations in Limoges in south-western France. They, or many of them, were Huguenots, {{which may explain}} why there is no record of her in church registers. The only document known to mention her disappeared in the 19th century. Suzanne was a common name among Huguenots. It is not clear if she was a de Court by birth or marriage. Often pieces just bear [...] "S.C.", but sometimes her full name, as illustrated. Her forms of signature include: [...] "SUSANNE COURT, SUSANNE DE COURT, SC or SDC", usually on the front of pieces. According to the British Museum, she was [...] "renowned for work with <b>translucent</b> <b>enamels</b> over foil, and draughtsmanship; specialising in secular, usually mythological scenes".|$|R
5000|$|The {{base of the}} jar is {{emblazoned with}} the reign mark Da Ming Jiajing nianzhi, or [...] "Made during the Jiajing reign of the great Ming dynasty," [...] in two columns, but the {{distinctive}} style {{would have made the}} time period clear enough without that label. While underglaze blue designs and overglaze enamel paintings began to appear on Chinese porcelain in the fifteenth century, during the sixteenth they became markedly bolder and more exuberant in design and color. This was a complex process, requiring multiple firings. For the first firing, a clear glaze over a cobalt-based paint resulted in vivid blue designs on the white porcelain. Before the second firing, <b>translucent</b> <b>enamels</b> applied over the glaze resulted in a range of brilliant colors. The end result is this vivid design, the swimming carp depicted from an angle that makes it appear the jar is transparent.|$|R

5000|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} basse-taille enamel began by marking {{the outline of}} the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a [...] "tracer". Then the interior area was worked, either with chasing tools, hammering and punching rather than cutting, or with chisels, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> was added; for example in the Royal Gold Cup the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In the example illustrated with Luke's ox the lowest lobe shows tufts of grass formed by cutting deeper into the background. In many of the recessed areas further decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel,</b> or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. Most background areas to the enamelled scenes were decorated in the same way. Finally the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, perhaps including scraping off any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{has been used}} since ancient times, though {{it is no longer}} among the most commonly used enamelling techniques. Champlevé is suited to the covering of relatively large areas, and to figurative images, although it was first prominently used in Celtic art for geometric designs. In Romanesque art its potential was fully used, decorating caskets, plaques and vessels, in Limoges enamel and that from other centres. [...] Champlevé is distinguished from the technique of cloisonné enamel in which the troughs are created by soldering flat metal strips {{to the surface of the}} object. The difference between the techniques is analogous to the woodworking techniques of intarsia and marquetry. It differs from the basse-taille technique, which succeeded it in the highest quality Gothic work, in that the bottoms of the recesses for the enamel are rough, and so only opaque enamel colours are used. In basse-taille the recesses are modelled, and <b>translucent</b> <b>enamels</b> are used, for more subtle effects, as in the 14th century Parisian Royal Gold Cup.|$|R
5000|$|Basse-taille, {{from the}} French word meaning [...] "low-cut". The {{surface of the}} metal is {{decorated}} with a low relief design which can be seen through <b>translucent</b> and transparent <b>enamels.</b> The 14th century Royal Gold Cup is an outstanding example.|$|R
50|$|The {{red colour}} of the {{original}} coach was recreated using strawberry coloured <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> and the blue upholstery of the interior was also reproduced in enamels. The coach is surmounted by the Imperial Crown in rose diamonds and six double-headed eagles on the roof; it is fitted with engraved rock crystal windows and platinum tyres decorated with a diamond-set trellis in gold and an Imperial eagle in diamonds at either door. The miniature is complete with moving wheels, opening doors, actual C-spring shock absorbers and a tiny folding step-stair.|$|E
5000|$|The anointing horn {{was made}} in 1606 in Stockholm by Peter Kilimpe for the {{coronation}} of Carl IX and is of gold {{in the shape of}} s bull's horn supported by a pedestal. The large end is closed by a lip with a chain and on the opposite point of the horn stands a small figure of justice holding a pair of scales. The horn is decorated in ornamental relief work with multi-colored opaque and <b>translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> and set with 10 diamonds and 14 rubies, including 6 Karelian 'rubies' (i.e., garnets).|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{had been}} known to the Ancient Romans, but was lost {{at the end of}} the Middle Ages until the 17th century. [...] <b>Translucent</b> <b>enamel</b> is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare. Medieval examples begin in Italy in the 13th century, with the earliest dated work being a chalice by the Sienese goldsmith Guccio di Mannaia, made for Pope Nicholas IV about 1290, which is part of the collection of the Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the [...] "surprise":Within is a gold easel surmounted by a diamond-set Star of Bethlehem {{inside a}} wreath over the year; the easel is fluted and embellished with carved gold floral and torch motifs and is set with gems and pearls. On it rests a {{heart-shaped}} plaque enamelled opalescent white on a sun-ray guilloché background and bordered by rose diamonds set in silver and surmounted by the Romanov crown also in diamonds. Eleven tiny <b>translucent</b> strawberry <b>enamelled</b> gold covers, each bearing its own monogram, are {{connected by a}} large diamond ‘M’ to form a decoration for the front of this plaque.|$|R
5000|$|Colour in enamel is {{obtained}} {{by the addition of}} various minerals, often metal oxides cobalt, praseodymium, iron, or neodymium. The latter creates delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm grey. Enamel can be transparent, opaque or opalescent (<b>translucent).</b> Different <b>enamel</b> colours can be mixed to make a new colour, in the manner of paint. [...] There are various types of frit, which may be applied in sequence. A ground coat is applied first; it usually contains smelted-in transition metal oxides such as cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and iron that facilitate adhesion to the metal. Next, clear and semi-opaque frits that contain material for producing colours are applied.|$|R
500|$|In {{the fake}} in Vienna, {{the figures of}} both saints are enamelled; flesh is white, Michael and the Christ child have red robes, and Christopher blue, and the saints stand on a {{brownish}} dragon and blue water respectively, with green grass below both of these. Some scholars have thought it unlikely that the forger invented this scheme, and therefore presumed that he copied enamel on the original that has been removed in the 19th century, probably because it was damaged—sections of enamel cannot be patched up, but must be removed completely and redone. However John Cherry believes this and other changes in the enamel of the Vienna version are elaborations by Weininger and his craftsmen; for example in Vienna {{the wings of the}} trumpeting angels are coloured. The two figures are in a sophisticated [...] "soft and flowing" [...] International Gothic style executed with great virtuosity; [...] Michael's staff is detached from the background over most of its length and is {{one of a number of}} elements that extend outside the frame of the door. [...] If there was once enamel on the two figures it would have been at least mainly in more fragile <b>translucent</b> <b>enamels,</b> as the very fine working of many details of them was clearly intended to be seen. [...] The rougher working of the surfaces at the bottom of the doors: the dragon below St Michael, the water below St Christopher, and the ground below both of these, suggests that the missing original enamels were opaque in these areas. [...] But all the extra enamel in Vienna is opaque, including the saints' figures, and the effect of the more intense colours is [...] "lurid" [...] and [...] "offends our eyes because of its crudity".|$|R
