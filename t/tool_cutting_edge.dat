Machining performance of the square structure fabrication on the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is investigated in the WEDM process, and the machining accuracy is explored in experimental analyses. In this proposed method, undesired overcut comes from the discharge between the processing debris and the side wall of the target structure. Furthermore, by applying the textured cutting tool, the target square structure is directly fabricated on the alumina workpiece with just a simple turning process, which verifies the feasibility of the proposed <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> textured method by applying the WEDM. This technology is expected to become a potential method for the mass production of {{micro structure}} surfaces in the future...|$|E

40|$|The energy {{required}} for tillage processes {{accounts for a}} significant proportion of total energy used in crop production. In many tillage processes decreasing the draft and upward vertical forces is often desired for reduced fuel use and improved penetration, respectively. Recent studies have proved that the discrete element modelling (DEM) can effectively be used to model the soil–tool interaction. In his study, Fielke (1994) [1] examined the effect of the various <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometries, namely; cutting edge height, length of underside rub, angle of underside clearance, on draft and vertical forces. In this paper the experimental parameters of Fielke (1994) [1] were simulated using 3 D discrete element modelling techniques. In the simulations a hysteretic spring contact model integrated with a linear cohesion model that considers the plastic deformation behaviour of the soil hence provides better vertical force prediction was employed. DEM parameters were determined by comparing the experimental and simulation results of angle of repose and penetration tests. The results of the study showed that the simulation results of the soil-various <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometries agreed well with the experimental results of Fielke (1994) [1]. The modelling was then used to simulate a further range of cutting edge geometries to better define the effect of sweep <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometry parameters on tillage forces. The extra simulations were able to show that by using a sharper cutting edge with zero vertical cutting edge height the draft and upward vertical force were further reduced indicating there is benefit from having a really sharp cutting edge. The extra simulations also confirmed that the interpolated trends for angle of underside clearance as suggested by Fielke (1994) [1] where correct with a linear reduction in draft and upward vertical force for angle of underside clearance between the ranges of − 25 and − 5 °, and between − 5 and 0 °. The good correlations give confidence to recommend further investigation of the use of DEM to model the different types of tillage tools...|$|E

Worm gears can be produced in different ways, {{depending on the size}} of the transmission, the number of courses, the pitch angle of worm profile, the number of units produced, the purpose of application, etc. As cylindrical worm gears we consider the cylindrical worms with globoid gears, globoid worm with globoid worm gear and globoid worm with cylindrical worm gearing. This paper deals with the evolvent worm whose curve of the tooth side in the front plane is evolvent. The production of worm with an optimal profile for optimal meshing conditions is an increasingly frequent focus of worm gear manufacturers.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} predict the {{characteristics}} of the machined part, such as geometry, surface roughness and fatigue or corrosion resistance, the cutting forces values should be known as precisely as possible. The edge discretisation methodology can be used to model the three components of the cutting forces. The results are generally considered as suitable, even if the considered cutting operation is complex, because the geometry is well described. Usually, the local cutting forces model is identified from orthogonal or oblique cutting tests and the local contributions are assumed to be independent of the orientation of the elementary edge in the reference plane Pr. However, when turning in the tool nose or with round inserts, the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angle Kr (or Side Cutting Edge Angle) evolves along the active cutting edge and the values of this angle are very small compared to that of 90 ° used in orthogonal/oblique cutting. For this study, a new elementary cutting operation, called "oriented cutting", has been tested. In this configuration, the active cutting edge is rectilinear, without inclination, but oriented by an angle Kr different from 90 °. In addition, cylindrical turning tests have been done. The measurements, performed in pure copper, show an influence of the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angle on the cutting forces. An interaction between Kr and the workpiece radius is also highlighted...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} production of worm gears and also the calculation of the tool cutting edges for their production. Based on the design parameters of worm and worm wheel, {{it is possible to}} calculate the coordinates of the shape of the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> The exact calculation of the coordinates or parameters requires mathematical formulations and applying mathematical relationships we can transform the design of worm screw profile to the profile of tool. Worms of different types can be produced in various ways, e. g. with a lathe and the plane to set a tool is either axial or normal. In this article we consider their production on the lathe and tool setting in the normal plane. Axial profile of worm is a curve which is the intersection of worm surface and the plane passing through its axis, and normal profile is perpendicular in a selected point to worm profile. This normal profile in more accurately way characterizes the shape of the worm profile, therefore, the calculation of the shape of the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is designed with a tool set to the normal plane.

40|$|The use of high {{pressure}} coolant supply {{results in a}} significant reduction in the tool-chip contact length, and hence the contact area.

40|$|Abstract. Improving {{of cutting}} process {{is one of}} the most {{important}} requirements that are expected from the machining methods in the recent years. In some machining processes, the positive effect of ultrasonic waves to improve the cutting process is used. The cutting process efficiency depends on the structure of excitation system which generates ultrasonic waves. One of the most important elements of this system is the ultrasonic waveguide. The role of waveguide is the transfer of ultrasonic vibration energy from ultrasonic transducer to the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> interacting with the workpiece (ultrasonic assisted machining-UAM). The UAM system performance depends on well-designed ultrasonic waveguide. The most important aspects of waveguide design are a resonant frequency, amplification factor and the determination of waveguide resonant wavelength- usually integer multiple of half wavelength. The effect of geometrical parameters of stepped waveguide on dynamical properties is presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Noteworthy {{results have}} been {{obtained}} in the turning and drilling of hardened high-strength steels using tungsten carbide based cutting tools. In a finish turning process, it was seen that surface roughness and tool flank wear followed very different trends against cutting time. The suggested explanation for this behaviour is that the profile cut into the workpiece surface {{is determined by the}} tool's cutting edge profile. It is shown that the profile appearing on the cut surface changes rapidly over time, so the profile of the <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> should also be changing rapidly. Workpiece material adhered onto the cutting tool, which is also known as a built-up edge, is a phenomenon which could explain the observations made. In terms of tool damage modes, workpiece material adhesion is believed to have contributed to tool wear in examples provided from finish turning, thread turning and drilling. Additionally, evidence of tool fracture and tool abrasion were recorded...|$|E
