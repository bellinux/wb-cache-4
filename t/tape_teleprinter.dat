50|$|In 1924 Creed {{entered the}} {{teleprinter}} field with their Model 1P, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code, {{and it was}} used for their new Model 3 <b>Tape</b> <b>Teleprinter</b> of 1927. This machine printed received messages directly onto gummed paper tape {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute and was the first combined start-stop transmitter-receiver teleprinter from Creed to enter mass production.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to {{simultaneously}} type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker <b>tape.</b> The <b>teleprinter,</b> in its more contemporary form, was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard, with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne. Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed.|$|R
50|$|OKW/Chi {{developed}} {{a series of}} <b>teleprinter</b> <b>tape</b> devices, to examine the periodicity or repetition of text, which employed early design of a photo-electric readers. They employed paper tapes, rather than celluloid film, which {{was used by the}} allies. By the end of the war, the first German film device was in construction. TICOM reported that it was similar to the USA developed Tetragraph-Tester (Tetragraph). It had speed of around 10k letters per second, against the USA development device at 500k letters per second.|$|R
50|$|The TXE4 had two {{standard}} teleprinters, {{which were}} used to give fault indications and other information. The difficulty of manually spotting trends brought an attempt to take the paper <b>tape</b> that the <b>teleprinter</b> produced, {{as well as the}} print, and automatically analyse it. It was called PATE4, which stood for Print Analysis TXE4 and was a software program that read the paper tape looking for common fault patterns. It was only reasonably successful but was never adopted on a national scale.|$|R
50|$|The {{differencing}} calculator with recording (German:Differenzen Rechengereat, English:Differencing Calculating Apparatus) was {{a machine}} designed to compute a flag of difference {{for a set}} of enciphered code groups and record it. it consisted of two <b>teleprinter</b> <b>tapes</b> with photoelectric reading heads, a set of calculating relays and an recording electric teleprinter. The read heads operated at 7 characters a second, bounded by the speed of the teleprinter where time was lost by the carriage return and line feed. It cost ℛℳ920 Reichsmarks, $800.00 at 1945 conversion rates.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955, the National Security Agency {{through the}} US Navy {{contracted}} with Philco {{to produce a}} computer suitable {{for use as a}} workstation, with an architecture based on the vacuum-tube computer system called Atlas II already in use at the NSA, and similar to the commercial UNIVAC 1103. At the time, Philco was the largest producer of surface barrier transistors, which were the only type available at the time in the speed and quantities required for a computer. The SOLO prototype was delivered in 1958, but required extensive debugging at NSA and no further instances were ordered. Difficulties were encountered with core memory and power supplies. SOLO used paper <b>tape</b> and <b>teleprinter</b> machines for input and output. [...] SOLO cost about $1 million US, and contained 8,000 transistors. While the system was extensively used for training, testing, research and development, no additional units were ordered. SOLO was removed from active service in 1963. [...] The design of the SOLO became commercialized as Philco's TRANSAC Model S-1000.|$|R
40|$|For the {{quantitative}} determination of crystal powder mixtures the photographie Debye-Scherrer technique offers considerableadvantages over measurements using Geiger-Muller counter goniometer. Firstly, smaller amounts can be analysed and secondly, the particular {{geometry of the}} ray path permits the analysis of coarser crystal powders. The disadvantages of the Debye-Scherrer technique are the additional work to develope the films, the increased possibility of errors when many films are developed, the preparing of characteristic curves to determine the relative intensities of single-phase powders, and the necessary photometric measurements. When a Weisenberg goniometer and exposures with small aperture are used the first two disadvantages can be omitted by combining many diffraction pattern on the same film. To minimize the work when preparing the sequence of exposuresfor the characteristic curves and to increase the measuring accuracy for standard mixtures an automatic time clock was developed. It opens and shuts a window in the X-ray path of the X-ray apparatus (e. g. Philips, PW 1316) for a pre-fixed time and controls the advance of the carriage of a Weisenberg goniometer (e. g. Enrof-Nonius Y 800, figure 1) between two consecutive X-ray exposures. An apparatus for the subsequent automatic photometry of the films with step-scanning by a Microdensitometer II (Enraf-Nonius) and the recording of the photometric values on punch <b>tape</b> of a <b>teleprinter</b> (Teletype ASR 33) is at present developed...|$|R
