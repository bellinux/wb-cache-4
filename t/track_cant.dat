5000|$|One {{solution}} is to place speed restrictions on curved sections of track; another is to bank the railbed on the curve, with the outer rail higher than the inner rail so the net force passes straight through {{the floor of the}} coach. Banking the track is known as [...] "cant" [...] or superelevation. These measures were gradually adopted on the railways between 1835 and 1860. The use of <b>track</b> <b>cant</b> can only be applied where the speed of the train is fixed in advance. Slower, or stationary, traffic sharing the same line will experience forces pulling inwards, and, conversely, faster traffic will still experience forces pulling outwards. Long experience has shown that, to avoid discomfort on slower trains, <b>track</b> <b>cant</b> should not exceed 6°; and, for trains moving more quickly, cant deficiency should not exceed 4.5°.|$|E

The change in cant is {{required in order to}} connect a tangent <b>track</b> (no <b>cant)</b> to a curved <b>track</b> (with <b>cant)</b> through a transition curve. The rate of change of cant is used to determine the suitable cant gradient for a given design speed.

However, in the UK, the term track twist is normally used in the context of cant gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{management}} of railway infrastructures, rail defect monitoring {{is one of the}} most significant task since it affects maintenance interventions, on one hand, and safety of train operation, on the other. In recent years, several high performance measuring devices, providing a huge amount of data that have to be carefully analyzed, have been developed and employed to accomplish this aim. There is therefore the need to develop efficient and reliable procedures able to reduce them into efficient synthetic descriptors and to detect significant variations. In this paper a preliminary analysis following a large experimental measure-ment campaign carried out on the Circumvesuviana railway network operating in the Naples metropolitan ar-ea is reported. <b>Track</b> <b>cant,</b> level, gauge and twist data have been collected with a 25 cm sampling interval within a two year long period by using the Plasser device (POS/TG System), directly mounted on an conven-tional vehicle.

40|$|Carbody tilting {{is today}} a mature and {{inexpensive}} technology allowing higher speeds in curves and thus reduced travel time. The technology is accepted by most train operators, but a limited {{set of issues}} still holding back the full potential of tilting trains. The present study identifies and report on these issues {{in the first of}} two parts in this thesis. The second part is dedicated to analysis of some of the identified issues. The first part contains Chapters 2 to 5 and the second Chapters 6 to 12 where also the conclusions of the present study are given. Chapters 2 and 3 are related to the tilting train and the interaction between track and vehicle. Cross-wind stability is identified as critical for high-speed tilting trains. Limitation of the permissible speed in curves at high speed may be needed, reducing the benefit of tilting trains at very high speed. Track shift forces can also be safety critical for tilting vehicles at high speed. An improved track standard must be considered for high speed curving. Chapters 4 and 5 cover motion sickness knowledge, which may be important for the competitiveness of tilting trains. However, reduced risk of motion sickness may be contradictory to comfort in a traditional sense, one aspect can not be considered without also considering the other. One pure motion is not the likely cause to the motion sickness experienced in motion trains. A combination of motions is much more provocative and much more likely the cause. It is also likely that head rotations contribute as these may be performed at much higher motion amplitudes than performed by the train. Chapter 6 deals with services suitable for tilting trains. An analysis shows relations between cant deficiency, top speed, tractive performance and running times for a tilting train. About 9 % running time may be gained on the Swedish line Stockholm – Gothenburg (457 km) if cant deficiency, top speed and tractive performance are improved compared with existing tilting trains. One interesting conclusion is that a non-tilting very high-speed train (280 km/h) will have longer running times than a tilting train with today’s maximum speed and tractive power. This statement is independent of top speed and tractive power of the non-tilting vehicle. Chapters 7 to 9 describe motion sickness tests made on-track within the EU-funded research project Fast And Comfortable Trains (FACT). An analysis is made showing correlation between vertical acceleration and motion sickness. However, vertical acceleration could not be pointed out as the cause to motion sickness as the correlation between vertical acceleration and several other motions are strong. Chapter 10 reports on design of track geometry. Guidelines for design of <b>track</b> <b>cant</b> are given optimising the counteracting requirements on comfort in non-tilting trains and risk of motion sickness in tilting trains. The guidelines are finally compared with the applied <b>track</b> <b>cant</b> on the Swedish line Stockholm – Gothenburg. Also transition curves and vertical track geometry are shortly discussed.

40|$|In wheel/rail contact, rolling {{phenomenon}} on {{the curved}} track {{can be much}} more complicated than that on the straight track, especially on a sharp curved track. Due to the influences of super-elevation (also called <b>track</b> <b>cant),</b> angle of attack (AOA) and rail cant, stress states on the high rail are significantly different from that on the low rail. Therefore, the appearances of damages on the low and high rails are different as well. These damages can result in the rail failures, subsequently leading to the vehicle derailments. In this paper, a realistic finite element model using Australian wheel/rail profiles (ANZR 1 wheel and 60. kg rail) was developed to investigate the wheel/rail contact on the low and high rail of a curved track under high adhesion condition. Based on the datum of contact stress states, surface damage mechanisms of the rail in curved track was determined. The new and worn profiles were utilized in the simulation to examine different contact situations: new wheel/new rail, new wheel/worn rail, and worn wheel/worn rail contacts. The obtained results showed that the two-point contact might appear on the high rail of the curved track and the stress distributions at each contact location were varied depending on the contact location and AOA. Moreover, the response of material at the rail head was predicted to be ratchetting. Regarding the damage predictions, the rail corrugation tended to be formed on the low rail rather than the high rail; and the fatigue defects could be easier developed on the standard carbon rail compared with hardened rail...|$|E
40|$|In wheel-rail contact, the {{locomotive}} adhesion characterises {{the capability of}} {{the locomotive}} to convert available friction into traction at the interface. Recently developed AC (Alternating Current) drive induces a higher adhesion level compared to DC (Direct Current) drive. This significantly affects the wheel-rail contact conditions such as damage initiation, high contact temperature due to frictional rolling, and wear of the rails. Three-dimensional (3 D) elasto-plastic finite element model (FEM) {{was used in this}} thesis to examine the wheel-rail contact on a straight track. Some sub-components of the track such as railpads, sleepers and ballast were also included in the model. Rolling contact stress states and material response of wheel/ rail under three contact situations (high adhesion, low adhesion and full slip) were investigated. Canted and non-canted rails were considered to determine the effect of the cant angle on the contact stress levels. Furthermore, the effects of contact curvature on the contact zone and contact pressure were also observed, and the response of material was predicted by a shakedown diagram. The more complicated rolling phenomenon of the wheel on a curved track was also investigated numerically in this thesis. Due to the influences of super-elevation (also called <b>track</b> <b>cant),</b> angle of attack (AOA) and rail cant, stress states on the high rail are significantly different from that on the low rail. The new and worn profiles were considered in the simulation to examine different contact situations: new wheel/new rail, new wheel/worn rail, and worn wheel/worn rail contacts. Material responses, the formation of rail corrugation and fatigue defects on both low and high rails were anticipated based on the results from simulations. In order to compare stress states AC and DC locomotives, two locomotive models of AC (C 44 ACi) and DC (Cv 40 - 9 i) currently run in Australia were evaluated under diverse operational situations (wheel loads, angle of attack and adhesion level). The software LS-DYNA was employed to build up a comprehensive wheel/rail contact model. The numerical model was constructed based on Australian wheel/rail profiles. Moreover the analytical method was also applied to evaluate the temperature rise on the rail, respectively. Calculation of wear volume on rail was eventually performed using the Archard’s wear model. Finally a 3 D coupled thermal-mechanical FE model was developed to examine the temperature rise due to high adhesion contact and the thermal influence on residual stress-strain, wear and rail life. The numerical model employed the moving heat source code developed by Goldak. The mechanical and thermal properties of the rail material were governed by temperature. The influence of repeated multi-passes from multiple wheels on one point of the rail was also taken into account. Moreover the formation of white etching layer (WEL) on the rail surface combined with rolling cycles can potentially lead to rail damage. A sub- 2 D FE model of WEL was also carried out to examine the stress state on the WEL if formed on the rail surface. The current thesis focuses on modelling wheel-rail contact under high adhesion condition, and explanation of the subsequent damage formation on the rail. The model provides {{a better understanding of the}} influences of high adhesion condition on contact stress states, damage initiation and also temperature rise on the rail. To the best of the author’s knowledge, the simulation of wheel-rail contact under high adhesion condition has not been studied elsewhere, and is presented in this study for the first time...|$|E

40|$|Super {{elevated}} track, {{where one}} rail is placed {{higher than the}} other, is used to reduce the acceleration, im-parted on passengers, to acceptable levels as a train travels round a curve.

On existing multi-use lines the need to reduce journey times through increased train speeds, has led to the introduction of tilting trains where the body rotates to maintain passenger comfort with the increased curving speed. This may lead to an overall increase in forces applied to the track, either verti-cally or laterally.

40|$|AbstractUrban Transport {{systems in}} big cities face many {{challenges}} because of continuous growth of the urban population, amount of cars and general overload of the public transportation. Challenges which the urban transport is facing have consequences for households, businesses and the whole urban community. Urban transportation takes a special part in linking economic growth and collective development as well as extensive negative impact on citizens’ health and surrounding environment. Many financial institutions and governments support cities and countries in their endeavor to build and improve transport infrastructure and systems to solve above issues. Within the other modern cities also Kraków with its almost 800 thousand people population is being challenged also in this regards. During the recent decades there has been done {{a major change in}} its urban transportation network. Trams rails network with a modern tram machines was defined as the {{one of the most important}} for the system. In Kraków the project is called “Krakow's Fast Tram”. Along with this extraordinary development there needs to be adopted and efficiently used a way to verify and maintain transportation infrastructure. Among the others the laser scanning with its incredible functionality and speed is becoming an answer for this demand. In the lane with data capturing the proper data management and access is coming. The authors used and underlined a big benefit of the combination of available metrology techniques including accurate total station measurements, laser scanning and GPS positioning. The project was started by measuring the Fast Tram Tunnel in Kraków with techniques mentioned above. The next step was to post process the data and assure proper quality so it can be used in all disciplines. To illustrate this innovative combination of techniques and possible use for various disciplines there has been prepared verification of transition curve, circulation curve, <b>track</b> gauge, <b>cant</b> and other parameters which are standard deliverables for tram track geometry studies. On the other hand the scan data management portal has been created with scan data available through the web site regardless the location. Finally with regards to the rapid development of the city infrastructure and community it is extremely important to use all currently available measuring techniques in an efficient and modern way which has to be fast and flexible enough to cope current demands. In this particular study laser scanning together with other surveying and analytics techniques helps to verify and maintenance tram infrastructure in urban transportation today and very likely will be the best method as well in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of railway ballast depends {{not only on}} the characteristics of the ballast itself but also the magnitude, frequency and number of axle loads imposed by the trains running on the track it supports. Recent trends towards more frequent and faster trains have highlighted some potential limitations of ballasted railway track. In particular, the introduction of tilting trains on the UK West Coast Main Line, which allowed train operating speeds to be increased over much of the route, has coincided with the sporadic occurrence of localized areas of ballast migration. This phenomenon involves ballast particles moving from the high side of a <b>canted</b> section of <b>track</b> to the low side, exposing the sleeper ends on the high (outer) side of the curve, reducing the lateral resistance of the track and therefore increasing maintenance requirements. This paper reports the results of an investigation carried out to try to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this behaviour. Measurements of sleeper end displacements under the passage of trains were made at two locations which had experienced ballast migration. Analysis of the measured data together with numerical modelling of the forces imposed on the track structure suggest that the increased speed and typical axle loads of the tilting trains result in larger lateral forces and larger rotation of the sleeper (in the vertical plane) than for a train consisting of a locomotive plus trailing vehicle, as was previously used on the route. It is hypothesized that this leads in turn to a slow but progressive movement of the ballast down the slope of the <b>canted</b> <b>track.</b> However, given the highly localized nature of the ballast migration sites, other factors such as an irregular sub-base stiffness and ballast depth may also contribute to the phenomenon and further work is required to determine the combinations of circumstances that may trigger this effect...|$|R
50|$|The race is {{preceded by}} a {{spectacular}} pageant, the Corteo Storico, which includes (among many others) Alfieri, flag wavers, in medieval costumes. Just before the pageant, a squad of carabinieri on horseback, wielding swords, demonstrate a mounted charge around the track. They take one lap at a walk, in formation, and a second at a gallop that foreshadows {{the excitement of the}} race to come, before exiting down one of the streets that leads out of Piazza del Campo. Spectators arrive early in the morning, eventually filling the centre of the town square, inside the track, to capacity; the local police seal the entrances once the festivities begin in earnest. Seats ranging from simple bleachers to elaborate box seats may be had for a price, but sell out long before the day of the race. At 7:30 p.m. for the July race, and 7 p.m. for the August race, the detonation of an explosive charge echoes across the piazza, signaling to the thousands of onlookers that the race is about to begin. The race itself runs for three laps of the Piazza del Campo, the perimeter of which is covered with several inches of dirt and tuff (imported and laid for the occasion at great expense to the city) and the corners of which are protected with padded crash barriers for the occasion. The jockeys ride the horses bareback from the starting line, an area between two ropes. Nine horses, in an order only decided by lot immediately before the race starts, enter the space. The tenth, the rincorsa, waits outside. When the rincorsa finally enters the space between the ropes the starter (mossiere) activates a mechanism that instantly drops the canapo (the front rope). This process (the mossa) can take a very long time, as deals have usually been made between various contrade and jockeys that affect when the rincorsa moves - he may be waiting for a particular other horse to be well- or badly-placed, for example.On the dangerous, steeply <b>canted</b> <b>track,</b> the riders are allowed to use their whips (in Italian, nerbi, stretched, dried bulls' hide) not only for their own horse, but also for disturbing other horses and riders. The Palio in fact is won by the horse who represents his contrada, and not by the jockeys. The winner is the first horse to cross the finish line - a horse can win without its rider (a condition known as cavallo scosso). A horse can also win without its decorative headgear (spennacchiera), although the opposite belief is widely held even among the Sienese. The loser in the race is considered to be the contrada whose horse came second, not last.|$|R
