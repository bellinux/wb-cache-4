5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E

This heading may {{sometimes}} be in a non-scrolling region—an area of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> does not move up or down via the scrollbar at the side of the window. Non-scrolling regions can only be used at the beginning of a topic. The Help author can control size and background color of a non-scrolling region.|$|E

It was confirmed on 28 January that Woodgate had signed for Tottenham for an undisclosed fee.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I could see through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed {{he got on the}} phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} bang Swigert {{reported}} a [...] "problem", which Lovell repeated and clarified as a [...] "main B bus undervolt", a temporary loss of operating voltage {{on the second}} of the spacecraft's main electrical circuits. Oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero. About three minutes later, the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed. Lovell reported seeing out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> the craft was venting [...] "a gas of some sort" [...] into space. The number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.|$|E
2500|$|Some touchpads have [...] "hotspots", {{locations}} on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the finger along {{an edge of}} the touch pad will act as a scroll wheel, controlling the scrollbar and scrolling <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> has the focus vertically or horizontally. Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling. Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device driver software, and can be disabled.|$|E

2500|$|Three clues {{were found}} at the scene. The first was the caliber of bullets. The second was a {{flashlight}} found in the hedge underneath <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> Starks was shot from. The last clue was of bloody prints around the house; shoe-prints on the kitchen floor, and smudged fingerprints in other places. Sheriff Davis stated that although this murder could not be directly linked to the Phantom because the caliber was a [...]22, [...] "it {{is possible that the}} killer is one and the same man." [...] Those who had been driving in the area near the time of the slaying, along with several men found within the vicinity, were picked up for questioning. Early Saturday morning, bloodhounds were brought in from Hope by the Arkansas State Police. They found two trails that led to the highway before the scent was lost. That night, many officers patrolled lovers' lanes hoping to prevent another attack. By Sunday night, more State Police officers were called in to help in the investigation and to aid in protecting the local civilians. Officers had detained at least twelve suspects but only kept three for further questioning. Forty-seven officers were working around the clock to solve the mysteries. Among them were sheriffs of four counties, Captain Gonzaullas and his staff of Texas Rangers, and Chief Deputy Tillman Johnson. The flashlight was sent to Washington, D.C. for further inspection by the FBI. Meanwhile, Mrs. Starks was showing improvements at Michael Meagher Hospital. The unofficial theory for a motive amongst the majority of the 47 officers was that of [...] "sex mania", because large amounts of money in the home were not taken, nor was Mrs. Starks' purse, which was lying on the bed containing money and jewels, and because nothing was stolen from the home. The title {{on the front page of}} the Texarkana Gazette on Sunday, May 5, 1946 read: [...] "SEX MANIAC HUNTED IN MURDERS".|$|E
2500|$|The {{sets were}} {{designed}} and dressed {{to consist of}} strong colors that could be emphasized by the series' cinematography, to help differentiate the show from the noir look and tone of Jessica Jones. The nightclub Harlem's Paradise was intended to invoke the real-life Harlem nightclubs the Cotton Club and the Lenox Lounge, with production designer Loren Weeks, also returning from that capacity on Daredevil and Jessica Jones, taking specific inspiration from The Apollo and Smalls Paradise. Because of the series' filming schedule and Coker's desire to film live musical performances in the club, {{it was decided that}} filming in an actual nightclub would be unrealistic. A set was built for the location, with Weeks using an art deco style to give the club [...] "a very distinctive look, and giving it an historical anchor", and indicate that it had been a successful club around the 1920s and 1930s and was now being refurbished as part of Stokes and Dillard's [...] "New Harlem Renaissance". Weeks felt the building could be a metaphor for the political undercurrents of the series. Set decorator Alison Froling, whom Weeks worked with on the other Marvel Netflix series, furbished the Harlem's Paradise set with contemporary [...] "furniture, finishes and lighting fixtures" [...] to contrast the older architectural design. The lounge side of the club features two murals by Archibald J. Motley, an artist from the original Harlem Renaissance. Coker insisted that the set for Pop's Barbershop be at street level, to connect it [...] "both visually and geographically" [...] with the Harlem street. For budget reasons, dressing an actual location as the barbershop was not going to work, but building a set to be at street level was also problematic since they {{would not be able to}} show people or cars driving past <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>that</b> you would see on an actual street. It was decided that a real location be found that is below street level so that scenes could be filmed on the street there, but would not have to match inside scenes filmed on the set because of the obstructed view of the street. To emphasize this, the set was built even lower than the actual store and a fake wall was added to the location. Coker instructed the series' prop master to carefully choose a selection of books to appear in Cage's bedroom, including Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man.|$|E
