40|$|The efficacies {{of the new}} {{quinolones}} <b>temafloxacin,</b> ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin {{were investigated}} against Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an experimental hamster pneumonia model. Hamsters were infected intratracheally with M. pneumoniae and sacrificed 18 h after the final medication, and their lungs were aseptically removed, homogenized, and cultured quantitatively. The efficacies of these drugs were determined by the CFU of M. pneumoniae in lungs. <b>Temafloxacin</b> and ofloxacin, but not ciprofloxacin, were active when the oral administration of 200 mg/kg of body weight per day (once per day) for 5 days was initiated 24 h after infection. Although {{no effect on the}} elimination of M. pneumoniae was observed after the administration of these drugs at 200 mg/kg/day at 5 days after infection, the continuous administration for 15 days of <b>temafloxacin,</b> but not ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, significantly reduced viable M. pneumoniae in the lungs. These results suggest that <b>temafloxacin</b> and ofloxacin are effective in the acute phase of infection and, moreover, that <b>temafloxacin</b> is effective in the late stage of infection during which progressive lung alterations and continuous increases in mycoplasmal growth occurred. The peak levels of <b>temafloxacin</b> in sera and lungs after oral administration were similar to those of ofloxacin and higher than those of ciprofloxacin. The areas under the curve of <b>temafloxacin</b> in the lung tissue, however, were higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. On the basis of these results, <b>temafloxacin</b> and ofloxacin might be promising antimicrobial agents for the treatment of mycoplasmal infection...|$|E

40|$|<b>Temafloxacin,</b> a new fluoroquinolone, was {{compared}} with amoxicillin {{in the treatment}} of adult hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In this double-blind, multicenter study, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with <b>temafloxacin</b> at 600 mg twice daily (n = 125) or amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily (n = 121); the average duration of treatment was 10 days. Clinical recovery rates were similar for patients treated with <b>temafloxacin</b> and amoxicillin (89 and 85 %), as were bacterial eradication rates (99 and 97 %). This was also true for subgroups of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (n = 100), nonpneumococcal pneumonia (n = 122), or atypical pneumonia (n = 12). Outcomes for temafloxacin- and amoxicillin-treated patients were also similar in terms of defervescence, improvement in leukocytosis, and radiographic evidence of infection. The frequency and severity of adverse events were similar in both groups, consisting primarily of digestive disorders and skin manifestations. We conclude that <b>temafloxacin</b> may be recommended as an alternative antibacterial drug for patients with suspected pneumococcal pneumonia who fail to respond to benzylpenicillin or amoxicillin when the incidence of multiresistant pneumococcal strains is low.

40|$|The {{use of new}} {{quinolones}} {{has become}} established therapy for many community infections including urinary tract infection, genital infection, soft tissue infection and some forms of lower respiratory tract infection. However, {{there has been an}} undercurrent of anxiety concerning their efficacy in pneumococcal infections. <b>Temafloxacin</b> has improved activity against pneumococci and its high oral bio-availability and excellent penetration into respiratory tissues now combine to provide a suitable profile for the management of a wider range of respiratory infections. Eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis collated from individual studies are 98 % overall and 100 % in pneumococcal infections. Furthermore, eradication rates in smokers and the elderly illustrate significant advantages for <b>temafloxacin</b> when compared with previous quinolones. In pneu-monia, a twice-daily <b>temafloxacin</b> regimen has given equivalent overall results to those of amoxycillin (84 - 6 % vs 80 %). In proven pneumococcal pneumonia, equiva-lent results (78 - 6 % vs 78 - 4 %) have been obtained with both drugs. A daily 600 mg dose of <b>temafloxacin</b> eradicated 94 % of pneumococcal isolates in one study and in another this agent given twice-daily orally proved comparable to parenteral cepha-losporin treatment. <b>Temafloxacin</b> shares with other quinolones excellent bacteriolo-gical and clinical efficacy against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. These results and the lack of potential interaction with thcophylline indicate <b>temafloxacin</b> to be suitable for domiciliary management of respiratory tract infec-tions in addition to a broad range of other community infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Temafloxacin,</b> a new fluoroquinolone, {{alone or}} in {{combination}} with tobramycin, was compared with penicillin, tobramycin, and their combination in the therapy of rabbits with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus adjacens GaDT, a new species of nutritionally variant streptococci. Animals were injected intramuscularly for 4 days with <b>temafloxacin</b> (50 mg/kg of body weight twice daily [b. i. d. ]) alone or combined with tobramycin (12 mg/kg once daily), with procaine penicillin (150, 000 U/kg b. i. d.) alone or combined with tobramycin (12 mg/kg once daily), or with tobramycin (12 mg/kg once daily) alone. Another group of animals was treated with a higher dose of <b>temafloxacin</b> (100 mg/kg b. i. d.). <b>Temafloxacin,</b> penicillin, and tobramycin MICs and MBCs were 1 and 2, 0. 015 and 1, and 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. Time-kill curves showed that the addition of tobramycin to penicillin or <b>temafloxacin</b> increased the killing rate. In vivo, treatment with <b>temafloxacin</b> (50 and 100 mg/kg b. i. d.) alone reduced the bacterial counts in vegetations (3. 9 +/- 0. 9 and 3. 1 +/- 0. 8 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation) compared {{with those in the}} vegetations of control animals (7. 5 +/- 0. 9 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation). This result was similar to that obtained with penicillin alone (4. 5 +/- 0. 8 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation). The combination of <b>temafloxacin</b> (50 mg/kg) and tobramycin was as effective as penicillin plus tobramycin (2. 5 +/- 0. 3 versus 2. 3 +/- 0. 4 log 10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively). The autoradiographic pattern of [14 C]temafloxacin diffusion into infected cardiac vegetations was studied. Thirty minutes after the end of infusion of 250 microCi of [14 C]temafloxacin, the [14 C]temafloxacin was homogeneously distributed throughout the vegetations.

The MICs of OPC 17116 for 90 % of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (0. 25 pg/ml) and Mycoplasma hominis (0. 125 pg/ml) isolates tested were closely {{similar to those of}} sparfloxacin and were four- to eightfold greater than those of ofloxacin. <b>Temafloxacin</b> was two- to fourfold more active than ofloxacin. Ureaplasma urealyticum was less susceptible; the MICs of OPC 17116 and <b>temafloxacin</b> for 90 %o of isolates tested were 2 and 4. 0,Lg/ml, respectively. The findings that both respiratory and genitourinary tract bacterial pathogens show increased resistance to common antimicrobial agents (10) have resulted in substantial prob-lems for antimicrobial chemotherapy and have led to a search for new antimicrobial agents. High-level resistance to such highly useful antimicrobial agents as penicillin, tetra-cyclines, and macrolides is common (10). Because of their lack of a cell wall, mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas are insusceptible to penicillins and other cell wall-specifi...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activities of}} three new quinolone compounds, sparfloxacin, <b>temafloxacin,</b> and WIN 57273, against anaerobic bacteria were determined in three separate studies. The Wadsworth agar dilution technique using brucella-laked blood agar was used throughout. The activities of other antimicrobial agents, ficluding ciprofloxacin, imipenem, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, were also determined. The breakpoints {{of the new}} quinolones were 2,Ig/ml for sparfloxacin and WIN 57273 and 4,ug/ml for <b>temafloxacin.</b> WIN 57273 displayed very good activity against anaerobes, inhibiting all strains of Bacteroidesfragilis group species at 2,Ig/ml. Only two strains of Fusobacterium species were resistant (MIC, 4,ug/ml). Sparfloxacin inhibited 78 % of B. fragiis strains and 44 % of other B. fragilis group isolates at 2,ug/ml. At 2,ug/ml, the percentages of other anaerobic species susceptible were as follows: B. gracilis, 70 %; other Bacteroides species, 61 %; Clostridium species, 50 %; Fusobacterium species, 70 %; Peptostreptococcus species, 91 %; non-spore-forming gram-positive rods, 71 %. <b>Temafloxacin</b> inhibited 91 % of B. fragilis strains and 87 % of other B. fragilis group species at 4,ig/ml. All strains of other Bacteroides species, 78 % of Fusobacterium species, 80 % of Clostridium species, and 90 % of Peptostreptococcus species were inhibited at 4,ug of <b>temafloxacin</b> per ml.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to {{investigate}} the 48 h pharmacokinetic and biliary elimination of <b>temafloxacin,</b> administered intraduodenally at a single dose of 10 mg/kg to six conscious pigs provided with a double terminal choledocal fistula allowing the collection and the rcinstillation of bile. The concentrations of tema-floxacin in biological fluids were measured by both HPLC and bioassay. The mean serum half-life of <b>temafloxacin</b> was 11 - 45 ± 4 - 4 h and the apparent oral clearance (assuming a 95 % bioavailability) was 171 ± 66 mL/min. The penetration of tema-floxacin into bile is significant as indicated by a bile/serum AUC ratio of 9 - 1 ± 2 - 2. The 0 - 45 h biliary excretion amounted to 2002 ± 0 - 8 mg, representing 0 - 9 ± 0 - 3 % of the administered dose. Biliary peak concentrations ranged from 8 - 0 to 37 - 5 mg/L and the 24 h mean biliary concentration was 3 - 7 ± 2 - 4 mg/L. No statistically signifi-cant differences between HPLC and bioassay concentrations or AUCs could be observed in bile, indicating that <b>temafloxacin</b> is not extensively biotransformed into active metabolites in this model. These data, together with data in man, suggest that <b>temafloxacin</b> could be a useful agent for the treatment of biliary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{prophylactic}} and therapeutic activities of three broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones were evaluated {{in two different}} experimental models of foreign-body infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) susceptible to quinolones. In a guinea pig model of prophylaxis, subcutaneously implanted tissue cages were infected at a > 90 % rate by 10 (2) CFU of MRSA in control animals. A single dose of 50 mg of ciprofloxacin per kg of body weight administered intraperitoneally 3 h before bacterial challenge was less effective than an equivalent regimen of either sparfloxacin or <b>temafloxacin</b> in decreasing the rate of experimental infection in tissue cages challenged with increasing inocula of MRSA. In a rat model evaluating the therapy of chronic tissue cage infection caused by MRSA, the efficacy of a 7 -day high-dose (50 -mg/kg twice-daily) regimen of sparfloxacin, <b>temafloxacin,</b> or ciprofloxacin was {{compared to that of}} vancomycin (50 mg/kg twice daily). Active levels of sparfloxacin, temfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin were continuously present in tissue cage fluid during therapy, exceeding their MBCs for MRSA by 6 - to 20 -fold. Either <b>temafloxacin,</b> sparfloxacin, or vancomycin was significantly (P < 0. 01) more active than ciprofloxacin in decreasing the viable counts of MRSA in tissue cage fluids. The different activities of ciprofloxacin compared with those of the other two quinolones against chronic tissue cage infections caused by MRSA did not involve the selective emergence of quinolone-resistant mutants. <b>Temafloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, which showed the most prominent differences in their in vivo activities, however, exhibited similar bactericidal properties and pharmacokinetic parameters in the rat model. In conclusion, both <b>temafloxacin</b> and sparfloxacin were significantly more active than ciprofloxacin for the prophylaxis or treatment of experimental foreign-body infections caused by a quinolone-susceptible strain of MRSA...|$|E
40|$|Previously, {{pefloxacin}} and ofloxacin {{were found}} to be active against Mycobacterium leprae in vitro, in experimental animals, and in clinical trials of lepromatous leprosy patients. In this study, we compared certain more recently developed fluoroquinolones (lomefloxacin, PD 124816, WIN 57273, <b>temafloxacin,</b> and sparfloxacin) with pefloxacin and ofloxacin in M. leprae-infected mice at doses of 50, 150, and 300 mg/kg given five times weekly. All seven of the fluoroquinolones studies were active against M. leprae; <b>temafloxacin</b> and sparfloxacin were the most active, being fully bactericidal at all three dosage schedules. Additionally, sparfloxacin was found to be fully bactericidal at 15 and 30 mg/kg given five times weekly...|$|E
40|$|The multiple-dose {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tolerance}} of <b>temafloxacin,</b> a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, were evaluated in healthy volunteers. <b>Temafloxacin</b> {{was found to}} be well tolerated when administered orally every 12 h for 7 days at doses of 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, and 800 mg. Steady-state maximum and minimum concentrations in plasma were proportional to dose, averaging slightly over 1. 0 and 0. 5 microgram/ml/ 100 mg administered. Analyses of variance found no significant differences among the dosage groups in total apparent clearances (CLT/F), renal clearances (CLR), or nonrenal clearances, which averaged 197, 119, and 78 ml/min, respectively. The half-life increased slightly with dose, averaging 8. 4 h overall. The extent of absorption of <b>temafloxacin</b> was quite reproducible, with day-to-day intrasubject variability in minima averaging under 10 %. Renal glomerular filtration of unbound drug was the dominant elimination process; however, tubular secretion and reabsorption also appear to occur. Secretion was estimated to account for about 12 % of CLT/F during a regimen of 600 mg every 12 h. CLR was relatively constant for urine flow rates above 1 ml/min, but reabsorption appeared to occur under low-flow conditions, resulting in day-versus-night differences in CLR. Intersubject variability in CLT/F over the eightfold range in dosage was only 20 %, and 60 % of this variance was accounted for by differences in body surface area (or lean body mass), concentration in plasma, and urine flow rate. Overall, it appears that the pharmacokinetics of <b>temafloxacin</b> are essentially linear, reproducible within a subject, and predictable among subjects...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of sparfloxacin, azithromycin, <b>temafloxacin,</b> and rifapentine against two virulent {{strains of the}} Mycobacterium avium complex isolated from patients with AIDS were evaluated in a model of intracellular infection and were {{compared with that of}} clarithromycin. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with the M. avium complex at day 6 of culture. The intracellular CFU was counted 60 min after inoculation. The intracellular and supernatant CFU was counted on days 4 and 7 after inoculation. The concentrations used, which were equal to peak levels in serum, were 10 micrograms of rifapentine per ml (MICs for the two strains, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml), 4 micrograms of clarithromycin per ml (MICs, 8 and 4 micrograms/ml), 1 microgram of azithromycin per ml (MICs, 32 and 16 micrograms/ml), 4 micrograms of <b>temafloxacin</b> per ml (MICs, 2 and 16 micrograms/ml), and 1 microgram of sparfloxacin per ml (MICs, 0. 5 and 2 micrograms/ml). Compared with controls on day 7 after inoculation, clarithromycin (P less than 0. 001), sparfloxacin (P less than 0. 001), and azithromycin (P less than 0. 001 for the first strain, P less than 0. 02 for the second) slowed intracellular replication. Rifapentine (P less than 0. 001) and <b>temafloxacin</b> (P less than 0. 001) slowed intracellular replication of the first strain but not of the second strain. Azithromycin plus sparfloxacin was as effective as sparfloxacin alone. In this macrophage model, sparfloxacin or clarithromycin (difference not significant) exhibited a better efficacy than rifapentine, azithromycin, or <b>temafloxacin</b> against intracellular M. avium complex infection...|$|E
