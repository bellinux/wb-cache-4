40|$|As {{the global}} {{population}} increases, so does global demand for energy, {{water and food}} expand. Meeting this continual spike of demand presents a tremendous challenge to Small Island States, given competing needs for limited resources amid heightened climate change. In order to overcome the increasing constraints that Small Island States encounter, serious consideration must be given with respect to how Small Island States produce and consume energy, produce water and provide food to their citizens. This critical <b>tri-partied</b> interaction {{is known as the}} Nexus. The interlinkage between the water, energy and food supply systems is a major consideration in countries’ sustainable development strategies. Rapid economic growth, expanding populations and increasing prosperity are driving up demand for energy, water and food, especially in the Small Island States in the developing countries. Advancements in renewable energy technologies provide access to cost-effective, secure and environmentally sustainable supplies of energy. Their rapid technology advancements can have substantial spill-over effects in the water and food sectors. Yet detailed knowledge on the role renewables can play in the management of the Nexus remains limited and widely dispersed, let alone aggressively practiced or not practiced in small island countries such as the Bahamas. Renewable energy technologies could address some of the trade-offs between water, energy and food, bringing substantial benefits in all three sectors. The objective of the Thesis is to explore whether Small Island States such as the Bahamas are taking full advantage of the current technology available to manage their Nexus. The Thesis primarily uses government policies and press reporting on Bahamian renewable energy projects, and how these programs influence the water, energy and food requirements for the Bahamas. The term "energy-water-food Nexus" refers to the complex interdependencies between energy, water and agriculture that vary by geography. The Nexus refers to the web of interactions that link energy, water and food in a common system, as growing food requires water, processing water requires power, and hydro-electric power generation requires water. Depleting the natural resources of islands to the point of annihilation is verifiable in island countries such as the Easter Islands. Small islands are a microcosm of the Earth. To study small island Nexus topics is an opportunity to understand the challenges experienced all over the world...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the research into Creating Socionas, a step-by-step approach to building creative understanding of user {{experience in the}} early stages of new product development (NPD). Creative understanding is the combination of a rich, cognitive and affective understanding of the other, and the ability to translate this understanding into products and services that are pleasurable and easy to use (Wright and McCarthy, 2005). It draws on information about the user and his/her everyday life, and it includes inspiration for design and empathy or “a feel” for the user. Several approaches to building creative understanding of user experience have been developed over the past years, including critical design, generative design research and empathic design (Sanders, 2006). They have been successfully used by their creators in projects for and with clients in the industry. Despite these successful efforts, designers and user researchers may experience two important challenges when trying to implement and practice the approaches in an industrial organization. The first challenge is to make sense of users’ experiences for design. Recent societal issues and socio-technological developments, including the mass adoption of real-time social media services, have made “the social” an essential topic for design. The social denotes the idea that human activity is fundamentally social, as opposed to individual. In the design research literature, it has been suggested that holistic approaches to understanding user experience that include the social are needed to develop products and services that delight users. However, most existing approaches to understanding user experience for design build on frameworks of user experience that focus on the individual, and leave design teams unequipped for understanding the social. The second challenge is to build creative understanding of user experience in the context of NPD practice. Existing approaches to understanding user experience often suggest that members of a design team adopt the role of user researcher, and directly interact with users to ensure that the user perspective is included in design. In NPD practice this interaction is not always feasible as the user research is frequently sourced from a third party, e. g., an external consultancy or an internal user research team. Thus the users researchers who perform the user research and the design team members who manage the concept design are usually not the same people in NPD practice. This means that the user data that has been gathered in user research needs to be shared with the design team. The richness and basis for building creative understanding is often lost in this process. The current research seeks to address these two challenges; it investigates what design teams need to understand about user experience to develop products that delight users, and how they can build this understanding under the constraints of NPD practice (chapter 1). “Creating Socionas” is proposed as a possible solution. Creating Socionas is an approach to building creative understanding that addresses the two challenges by offering a conceptual framework that helps designers and user researchers to make sense of user experience for design, plus five steps that guide them through the process of building this understanding under the constraints of NPD practice. The approach builds on empathic design – an approach to designing for experience that is characterized by a design attitude of respecting users, being committed to understanding users’ needs and desires, building holistic understanding of users’ activities, and relying on personal insight and creativity (Mattelmäki, 2006). The research into Creating Socionas proceeded through cycles of developing and evaluating the approach in ongoing NPD projects at Philips. Design practice and design theory were closely integrated in the research process. In chapter 2, the research approach is described as research through design, by which I mean, “generating new knowledge or understanding through cycles of developing and evaluating experiential artefacts and process prototypes”. The chapter explains how action research methodology was used as a framework for practicing a research through design approach in addressing the research questions, after which it introduces eight empirical cases at Philips in which instantiations of Creating Socionas were developed and evaluated. The following four chapters explain the development of Creating Socionas and the knowledge and insights that were generated in the projects at Philips. Chapter 3 provides a critical reflection on the use of user-centered design approaches in industry, and the differences between industry and academic research settings. In this chapter, we review the literature of empathic design, and discuss our own experiences with introducing and practicing empathic design in several NPD projects at Philips Research over the past years. Having experimented with empathic design in an industrial context, we experienced success but also encountered eight challenges that relate to discrepancies between the theory of empathic design as described in literature on the one hand, and the application of empathic design in an industrial context on the other. An example is the earlier described discrepancy between empathic design’s advise to engage design team members as multi-disciplinary experts in user research on the one hand, and the common practice of sourcing user research from external consultancies or internal user research teams on the other, which raised questions of who, when and how to engage design team members in user research. Three cultural and methodological changes are proposed for addressing these challenges in the future. These include changing focus (a) from rational approaches to including empathic approaches, (b) from users as informers to users as partners in new product development (NPD) practice, and (c) from being informed of user research to being engaged in user research. The first two changes are consistent with those proposed by Sanders (2006), which endorses our conviction that other industrial organizations face similar challenges when introducing and practicing empathic design. The third dimension is new. It highlights an area of empathic design that is still largely unaddressed in the literature, but may be key in successfully embedding empathic design within an industrial organization. Chapter 4 introduces the concept of “trialogue”. Trialogue is a framework for sharing rich user data in NPD practice that was developed by using Wright and McCarthy’s (2005) concept of dialogue between designer and user to explore the <b>tri-partied</b> interaction between users, user researchers and design teams in NPD practice. Existing approaches to understanding user experience for NPD often assume that designers build creative understanding in direct interaction with users. In NPD practice, the interaction between users and the designers is often mediated by a third party performing the user research. In these cases, the rich user data gathered in user research needs to be shared with designers in ways that enable them to build creative understanding of user experience for design. In chapter 4, we identify and discuss four requirements for successfully building creative understanding in situations of trialogue, after which we discuss five implications of trialogue for sharing user data in NPD practice. One important implication is the active engagement of design teams in reading and interpreting user data for NPD, rather than in gathering user data, as is suggested for situations of dialogue. Creating Socionas builds on this implication. Chapter 5 reports our search for a conceptual framework that design teams could use as thinking tool of the social in empathic design. Despite the fundamentally social nature of life, most existing frameworks intended to generate perspectives of user experience in design still focus on the individual. Therefore, a conceptual framework is needed to sensitize design teams towards both relationality and individuality in designing for user experience. Building on the idea of engaging design teams in reading and interpreting user data for design, we set out to find a conceptual framework that design teams could use as thinking tool of the social in making sense of rich user data. In chapter 5, we review a number of possible frameworks on the basis of literature and describe our experiences in applying candidate frameworks in NPD practice at Philips. A set of criteria for assessing the usefulness of frameworks for empathic design and five groups of frameworks are identified, “special effect theories”, “relational frameworks”, “catalogues”, “metaphors”, and “scaffolds of context”. Activity Theory (AT) (Vygotsky, 1978; Leont’ev, 1978), as a scaffold of context, is found to have the best fit between design teams’ needs in empathic design and the frameworks’ offerings. An important advantage that AT brings is that it addresses the individual’s experience and social context. Having experimented with AT as thinking tool of the social in NPD practice, we found that AT is a potentially powerful framework for structuring, discussing and sharing rich user data in empathic design. Chapter 6 proposes Stanislavsky’s approach to play-acting as an intuitive way for practicing Activity Theory in empathic design. Activity Theory provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing user experience data for design, but is generally considered to be “hard to learn” and “difficult to put into practice”. More intuitive ways are needed for design teams to grapple with AT in interpreting user data for NPD. We found Stanislavsky’s System, an approach to acting that supports actors in the process of embodying and enacting a role (Stanislavsky, 1961), to provide these intuitive ways. In chapter 6, we discuss the conceptual relations between Stanislavsky’s System and Activity Theory, and show how Stanislavsky’s System was used to translate Activity Theory for empathic design in an NPD project at Philips. Our approach in this project was successful in that the design team built creative understanding of user experience from an AT perspective, without perceiving the approach as “too theoretical” or “difficult to grasp”. Chapter 7 consolidates the knowledge and insights from the previous chapters into a five-step approach to building creative understanding of user experience, Creating Socionas. In this chapter, I explain how user researchers and designers in Philips and in similar organizations might implement and practice Creating Socionas, using examples from NPD projects at Philips to illustrate the approach. Looking back on the research into Creating Socionas in chapter 8, I find that Creating Socionas is unique from most other approaches to understanding user experience for design in that the approach (1) sensitizes design teams towards the individual’s experience and social context in building understanding of user experience, (2) explains how design teams can build creative understanding of user experience in situations of trialogue, and (3) combines a conceptual framework that helps design teams to make sense of user experience for design, with a hands-on approach that guides them through the process of building this understanding under the constraints of NPD practice. A limitation of the approach is its transferability; Creating Socionas reliably applies to NPD practices similar to those at Philips only, and practitioners will need to adjust the approach to fit with their own contexts of NPD. Therefore, it is recommended that further research investigates the transferability of the approach. The results of such research may raise confidence in the success factor of Creating Socionas, and may persuade managers and other stakeholders to implement and invest in the approach in their organizations, and thereby develop products and services that resonate with users’ social lives.

On May 15, 1989, the Washington Department of Ecology, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Energy entered into the <b>Tri-Party</b> Agreement, which provides a legal framework for environmental remediation at Hanford. [...] the agencies are engaged in the world's largest environmental cleanup, with many challenges to be resolved {{in the face of}} overlapping technical, political, regulatory, and cultural interests. The cleanup effort is focused on three outcomes: restoring the Columbia River corridor for other uses, converting the central plateau to long-term waste treatment and storage, and preparing for the future. The cleanup effort is managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the two regulatory agencies. A citizen-led Hanford Advisory Board provides recommendations from community stakeholders, including local and state governments, regional environmental organizations, business interests, and Native American tribes. Citing the 2014 Hanford Lifecycle Scope Schedule and Cost report, the 2014 estimated cost of the remaining Hanford clean up is $113.6billion – more than $3billion per year for the next six years, with a lower cost projection of approximately $2billion per year until 2046. About 11,000workers are on site to consolidate, clean up, and mitigate waste, contaminated buildings, and contaminated soil. Originally scheduled to be complete within thirty years, the cleanup was less than half finished by 2008. Of the four areas that were formally listed as Superfund sites on October 4, 1989, only one has been removed from the list following cleanup.|$|E

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a <b>tri-party</b> repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the <b>tri-party</b> agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The <b>tri-party</b> agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal <b>tri-party</b> agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal <b>tri-party</b> agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US <b>tri-party</b> repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As <b>tri-party</b> agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a <b>tri-party</b> agreement the three parties to the agreement, the <b>tri-party</b> agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The <b>tri-party</b> agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A <b>tri-party</b> repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the <b>tri-party</b> repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|E
