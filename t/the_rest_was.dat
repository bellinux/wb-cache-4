5|$|Al-Birwa's total {{land area}} {{consisted}} of 13,542 dunams (13.42 hectares), of which 59 dunams were built-up areas. of which 130 were Christians. Cultivable land accounted for 77% {{of the total}} land area. Orchards were planted on 1,548 dunams of which 1,500 were used for olive groves, while 8,457 were allotted to grains. The residents of the town sold 536 dunams to Jews, and most of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> Arab-owned.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, {{the section}} south of 11Mile Road near Royal Oak {{was removed from}} M-150; {{sections}} were rebuilt as part of I-75 and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> turned over to local control. The northern extension from the 1930s was removed in 1965 when the trunkline was shortened to end {{on the north side}} of Rochester at Tienken Road. The southern section was later truncated back to the current southern terminus at M-59 in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In April 1961, PA848 was {{designated}} from Gibson to New Milford {{as part of}} the construction of I-81 to make sure interchanges were with numbered routes. The rest of the alignment {{was designated}} part of PA374 from Lyon Street (west of Union Dale) to Union Dale. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> later designated Township Road945 from Gibson to PA92 intersection and SR2034 from PA92 to PA374.|$|E
5|$|Of the A$1.17 billion {{allocated}} to the fast track program, only A$143 million was required to fix problems where the submarines did not correspond with the original contract: <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> used to update components that were technologically obsolete and make changes to the submarines beyond the contract specifications. When the fast track program is factored in, the Collins class cost just under 20% more than the inflation-adjusted contract value; a smaller increase than other contemporary defence projects.|$|E

5|$|The {{prospect}} of expanding KeyArena resurfaced on March 6, 2008, when Microsoft CEO {{at that time}} Steve Ballmer, promised that his investor group would pay half of the $300 million needed for an extensive renovation; <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> to be provided by the city and county. However, when the state legislature did not give approval for the county to provide funds by an April 10 deadline, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said that the effort had failed and the city's hopes rested in its lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|With its oak {{panels and}} other decor recalling an earlier time, {{the heyday of}} cabaret, the Oak Room was small, intimate, and {{expensive}} (at least $100 per person, more if one had dinner, except for matinees), and was not a big moneymaker for the Algonquin. Part of the space occupied by the former Oak Room was used to enlarge the Blue Bar, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> converted into a private breakfast room for Marriott Reward Elite customers.|$|E

5000|$|The six {{companies}} had 18800 km of routes (mostly [...] gauge) {{in use in}} the late 1980s. About 25% of the routes were in double-track and multitrack sections, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>were</b> single-track. In 1988 about 51% of the six companies' 1,000 locomotives <b>were</b> diesel, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>were</b> electric.|$|R
5|$|Bergen Aviation was {{established}} in 1984. Fifty percent of Bergen Aviation was owned by the insurance company Vesta, twenty percent was owned by Vestlandreiser, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> owned by various companies based in Bergen. The airline's first contract was with charter tour operator Vestlandsreiser, which was scheduled to begin on 1 May 1986. The contract was secured after Vestlandsreiser on 30 January 1986 had announced that they would terminate their agreement with Swedish airline Transwede, citing the latter's repeated delays and cancellations. The contract consisted of services from Stavanger Airport, Sola; Bergen Airport, Flesland; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; and Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Palma de Mallorca Airport, Spain and Crete, Greece. To operate the charter routes, Bergen Aviation bought a 99-seat Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle from Hispania Líneas Aéreas in January 1986, financed with a loan from Nevi.|$|E
5|$|Grants {{were issued}} from the {{municipalities}} in 2005, {{the size of}} which {{was determined by the}} population of each municipality. Multiconsult was hired to design the venue and construction started on 28 June 2006. Earthworks were completed by November and asphalting started on 16 May 2007. The all-weather surface was completed on 13 June and technical installations were completed by mid-August. The new venue was inaugurated on 1 September 2007. It cost NOK28.6 million, of which NOK15.9 million were paid for by the municipalities in ratio of their population. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> financed through a combination of betting grants, value added tax compensation and volunteer work.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Manas {{score was}} {{composed}} by Yoko Shimomura, {{and of all}} her compositions, she considers it the one that best expresses herself. Kenji Ito returned to the series with Sword of Mana. He also composed roughly {{one third of the}} Children of Mana soundtrack, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> composed by Masaharu Iwata and Takayuki Aihara. Ito was the main composer for Dawn of Mana, assisted by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Junya Nakano, as well as main theme composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. In North America, purchasers of Dawn of Mana from participating retailers were offered a sampler disc, titled Breath of Mana, which features a selection of tracks from the game. Shimomura has returned to the series with Heroes of Mana, while also contributing one song to Rise of Mana.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12. Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos laboratory in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist has a tower {{dating from}} the 15th century, {{although}} the upper stages are from the 17th century, but <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt in Gothic Revival style by John Pinch the younger in 1830–1831 and was extended in the 20th century with new chancel and lady chapel. It is a grade II* listed building. The churchyard includes a memorial to the 12 miners killed in 1839 when their rope was severed. St. John's {{is part of the}} Diocese of Bath and Wells. The Patronage vests in Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were {{dominated}} by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system became more and more impractical, especially {{after the turn of the}} 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively— often by locking out workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> apportioned among the local unions.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} {{census of}} Africans in Zambia {{was carried out}} in Zambia during May 1963, when the country was a British colony, while the enumeration of non-African people was performed during 1961. Before the 2010 census enumeration, there were four census enumeration exercises carried out in independent Zambia during 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. Around 60 per cent of the 2010 census was funded by UNFPA, UKAID (formerly DFID), USAID and AfDB, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> contributed by the Zambian Ministry of Finance. UKAID allocated UK£3 million to the 2010 Zambian census during 2010-13 for financial and technical support.|$|E
5|$|The sports venues {{were taken}} over by the {{respective}} municipalities. The Lillehammer venues are owned by the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark, while similar companies were created for Hamar and Gjøvik. The International Broadcasting Center was built as a future campus for Lillehammer University College. The Main Press Center was converted to a business park. Only part of the athlete accommodation was built for permanent use, and was sold as regular housing after the Games. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> built as mobile units and sold {{to other parts of the}} country. Similarly, the media accommodation was built as a mix of permanent and temporary housing, with the latter being sold as cottages after the Games were completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the {{expedition}} was estimated at £90,000 (2009 equivalent about £7.25 million), of which £45,000 was offered by the British Government provided that the two Societies could raise a matching sum. They achieved this, thanks largely to a donation of £25,000 from wealthy RGS member Llewellyn W. Longstaff. The RGS itself contributed £8,000, its largest single contribution to any expedition to that date, and £5,000 came from Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, who had earlier financed the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition to the Arctic, 1894–97. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>was</b> raised from smaller donations. The expedition also benefited from significant commercial sponsorship: Colman's provided mustard and flour, Cadbury's gave 3,500lb (1,600kg) of chocolate, Bird's donated baking and custard powders, Evans, Lescher & Webb provided all the lime juice. Jaeger gave a 40% discount on special clothing, Bovril supplied beef extract, and others made significant contributions.|$|E
