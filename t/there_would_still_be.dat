However, in Randi's opinion it was not funding but the experimenters that were the problem. With $500,000 from McDonnell, Randi felt that lack of funding could no longer be blamed for any failure.

25|$|Jensen {{also argued}} that even if g were {{replaced}} by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. He argues that all tests of cognitive ability {{would continue to be}} highly correlated with one another and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> a black-white gap on cognitive tests. Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.|$|E
25|$|They {{were first}} {{developed}} by WACA curator John Maley {{for use in}} the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. Drop-in pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment. Along with other revolutions during the series including the white ball, floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, drop-in pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly seaming and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> something in the pitch for the bowlers.|$|E

Although this point has not yet been settled, dolus incidens probably gives a right only to damages, not to rescission of the contract; this is likely also to apply to an ‘incidental’ misrepresentation made without fraud.|$|R

25|$|Footage {{shown at}} PlayStation Experience 2015 {{demonstrated}} both exploration and battle mechanics, which both {{take place in}} real-time like Final Fantasy XV. Unlike the 'Active Time Battle' system of the original, the remake appears to use a real-time battle system similar to the Kingdom Hearts series, which allows players to freely control Cloud {{or one of his}} allies as they use their respective weapons to attack enemies. Players will also be able to use magic and summons, and a Limit Break gauge allows characters to perform more powerful attacks once charged. Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that while the game has more real-time elements, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> strategic elements, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} {{communities were}} the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC). These were markedly less supranational {{than the previous}} communities, due to protests from some countries that their sovereignty was being infringed (however <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> concerns with the behaviour of the Hallstein Commission). The first formal meeting of the Hallstein Commission was held on 16 January 1958 at the Chateau de Val-Duchesse. The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) {{was to create a}} customs union while Euratom would promote co-operation in the nuclear power sphere. The EEC rapidly became {{the most important of these}} and expanded its activities. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products. In 1968, internal tariffs (tariffs on trade between member nations) were removed on certain products.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the two flights at Logan International Airport was within Terminal B, but the two gates were not connected within security. Passengers must leave the secured area, go outdoors, cross a covered roadway, and enter another building before going through security once again. There are two separate concourses in Terminal B; the south concourse is mainly used by US Airways and the north one is mostly used by American Airlines. It had been overlooked that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> a security screen to pass in Boston because of this distinct detail of the terminal's arrangement. At 6:45am, while at the Boston airport, Atta took a call from Flight 175 hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi. This call was apparently to confirm that the attacks were ready to begin. Atta checked in for American Airlines Flight 11, passed through security again, and boarded the flight. Atta was seated in business class, in seat 8D. At 7:59am, the plane departed from Boston, carrying 81 passengers.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{efforts have}} been made to provide each of the city's eight wards a seat in the city council, instead of the current at-large format. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> some at-large seats under this format. The primary {{argument}} for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8–1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3–1. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years.|$|E

500|$|Smith, {{a farmer}} from the Midlands town of Selukwe {{who had been}} seriously wounded while serving in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia's first {{native-born}} Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a [...] "raw colonial"—when he took over, Smith's personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF's replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader Harold Wilson called it [...] "brutal", while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as [...] "a suicide squad... {{not interested in the}} welfare of all the people but only in their own". Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black nationalist rule and apartheid so that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> [...] "a place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed.

In 1819 Schopenhauer published his treatise on The World as Will, which is the metaphysical complement to Lamarck's natural history, as it demonstrates that the driving force behind Evolution is a will-to-live, and to live, as Christ said long before, more abundantly. And the earlier philosophers, from Plato to Leibniz, had kept the human mind open for the thought of the universe as one idea behind all its physically apprehensible transformations.|$|R

500|$|When the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} the bankrupt Penn Central in 1976, it was allowed to choose which lines to keep and which to abandon. The line between Avondale and Brecon still saw heavy freight traffic, and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> a reasonable amount of traffic to Mason and Hempstead. Thus Conrail bought about half of the ex-CL, including the main line from Cincinnati to Brecon (Blue Ash Secondary Track), Mason to Hageman (Mason Secondary Track), Hempstead to Pasadena (Kettering Running Track), and Patterson Road to Dayton (DP Industrial Track), as well as Middletown to Hageman (Middletown Secondary) and Hempstead to Clement (Clement Running Track). Ownership of the remaining lines—Brecon to Mason, Hageman to Lebanon, Lytle to Hempstead, Pasadena to Patterson Road, and Hageman to Middletown Junction—remained with the Penn Central trustees, although, with local funding, Conrail operated the two segments from Hageman to Lebanon and Centerville to Hempstead as [...] "light density lines". Tracks between Lytle and Centerville were torn up in 1979. Since then, several more segments have been abandoned, including Avondale to McCullough and Centerville to Kettering. Short line Indiana and Ohio Railway (IORY) acquired most of the remainder in the 1980s, beginning operations from Monroe (near Middletown) to Mason and Lebanon in March 1985, and McCullough to Brecon in December 1986. The city of Lebanon has bought the Hageman-Lebanon segment, initially owned by the Penn Central trustees, and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority {{acquired the}} property between McCullough and Brecon in 1997 for a proposed public transit line. (IORY continues to operate freight on both of these segments.) The IORY began running tourist trains on the Lebanon segment in 1985. The passenger operations were split in 1996, going through several renamings to Turtle Creek Valley Railway, Turtle Creek and Lebanon Railway, and finally Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad. Three short segments of line at Middletown and Dayton remained with Conrail until its 1999 breakup, when the Norfolk Southern Railway acquired Conrail's assets in southwestern Ohio.|$|E
