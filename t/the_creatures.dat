5|$|Jeff Glaser, a local {{technician}} {{armed with}} a FLIR device, joins Fazekas, Mulder, and Scully on {{a search for the}} creature. They soon spot two creatures on the FLIR which travel in separate directions, causing the four to split up. Fazekas is attacked and disappears. Mulder deduces from this that <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> {{may be related to the}} Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. After a brief encounter with <b>the</b> <b>creatures,</b> Glaser takes off running and is swiftly killed by a creature. Mulder is grabbed by the other creature, though it releases him after Scully manages to wound it with her firearm.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} {{intelligence of the}} game's enemies, the Aliens, was regarded as lacking, and one reviewer noted that their blood was not acidic, a defining characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> from the films. Several reviewers did praise the game's representation of the Predator, however, especially in the early levels.|$|E
5000|$|Colm Feore as Adm. Anthony [...] "Tony" [...] Richland, a {{government}} agent who attempts to kill <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> He {{was there when}} <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> escaped and was attacked. He has a personal vendetta against <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> He was eaten by <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b>|$|R
50|$|Biotrog brought <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> back {{to their}} base of {{operations}} for containment (KF#17) {{but it was only}} a matter of time before <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> was able to escape. During the battle, Biotrog again was overpowered by <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> who used his sonic blasts. However, Biotrog discovered that aside from freezing <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> it could also be defeated by fire. Using some explosive shurikens, Biotrog was able to defeat <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> (KF#55).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Creature</b> hides {{in an old}} cottage that is {{inhabited}} by a married couple, Felix and Agatha, and Felix's elderly, blind father, De Lacey. <b>The</b> <b>Creature</b> comes {{to care for them}} and brings them in food in secret. De Lacey finds and befriends <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> and teaches him to speak, read and write. <b>The</b> <b>Creature</b> reads Victor's journal and learns about his creator. De Lacey also teaches <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> about love, and <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> dreams of having a female partner, created by Victor. One day, Felix and Agatha come home and find the Creature; much as <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> had feared, they are repulsed by him and drive him out. Enraged, <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> sets fire to the cottage, killing the entire family. He swears revenge on Victor for bringing him into a world that hates him.|$|R
5|$|The tengu of {{this period}} were often {{conceived}} of as the ghosts of the arrogant, {{and as a result}} <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> have become strongly associated with vanity and pride. Today the Japanese expression tengu ni naru ("becoming a tengu") is still used to describe a conceited person.|$|E
5|$|They {{travel by}} riverboat until being {{transferred}} {{to a group of}} armed escorts who are to lead them overland to the Mexico–US border. The convoy is attacked by <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> Andrew and Samantha escape, but none of the guards survive. Continuing on, they discover the bodies of dead travellers and bond at the top of an ancient pyramid in sight of the US border wall. By the time they reach the border, <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> have crossed into the United States. Andrew and Samantha travel through a severely damaged, evacuated town in Texas, find an abandoned gas station with power and call the army for help.|$|E
5|$|After a NASA deep-space probe (sent {{to verify}} the {{existence}} of extraterrestrial life in the solar system) crash lands in Mexico, extraterrestrial life forms spread throughout the Mexico–United States border region, leading to the quarantine of the northern half of Mexico. US and Mexican troops battle to contain <b>the</b> <b>creatures,</b> and a huge wall stretching along the border ostensibly keeps the US protected.|$|E
5000|$|Victor tracks <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> to <b>the</b> Alps and confronts him. <b>The</b> <b>Creature</b> asks Victor {{to create}} a female mate for him, {{promising}} in return to leave humanity alone; <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> also threatens to destroy Victor's life if he refuses. Left with little choice and intrigued by the challenge, Victor agrees. He moves to Scotland and, {{in a matter of}} months, creates a [...] "bride" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>Creature.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> comes to claim her, however, Victor refuses to give her to him, aghast at the possibility of their creating a race of monsters. He destroys the female, and <b>the</b> <b>Creature</b> swears revenge.|$|R
50|$|<b>Creatures</b> {{represented}} <b>the</b> pyramid's guardians {{or other}} (hostile) treasure hunters. The player {{had a choice}} of {{how to deal with}} <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> Attacking, Trickery or Retreating. Each option involved rolling the die and adding the appropriate attribute score, then comparing to <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> relevant attribute plus a die roll.A successful Attack defeated <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> while a Retreat moved the character back a number of squares. Trickery had a graded success level - just beating <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> caused it to be discarded, while beating <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> by a large margin allowed the player to use <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> as a single use bodyguard against other creatures.|$|R
50|$|As {{a reward}} for {{retrieving}} the root, the witches lead <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> to an elf, the original thief of the Vapours, who <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> can extort for {{information on how to}} access the Galleykeep, Marr's flying vessel. Aboard the Galleykeep Marr reveals <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> identity and demands that he surrender Grog's box, which contains the Vapour of Elven Magic. If <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is able to defeat Marr by destroying his portal, the necromancer is banished from the world of the living and <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> reverts into their previous human self, returning to his position as commander of the Galleykeep. If <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> fails, Marr takes the vapour by force and it is implied that Marr uses it to conquer the world of Titan with <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> either as Marr's second-in-command or slaughtered by his crew.|$|R
5|$|Amy awakens to {{find herself}} {{strapped}} to an examining table, near to where Ambrose's husband Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians intended to vivisect her, as they have vivisected him— awake. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects to encounter {{only a few of}} <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{addition}} to the fighting force debuting in Halo 2 were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> challenging, as {{they had to be}} animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Bruce Wayne {{falls down}} into a dry well and is {{attacked}} by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia of <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.|$|E
50|$|There, {{the chief}} is reunited with Elizabeth and finally understands and accepts Dr. Chase {{as a good}} man. Dr. Chase, Tall Man, Max, and Dr. Macy return to {{headquarters}} where Peniston is waiting. Dr. Macy realizes he was there. She angrily asks him why he did not kill <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> Peniston replies {{that it was because}} they used his blood to help create it and that <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is a part of him. They use Robin with a camera attached to her back to locate <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> It locates <b>the</b> beast's lair, but before they can retrieve her, <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> attacks and <b>the</b> camera goes blank. Tall Man and Peniston enter the tunnel shortly after. They see <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> eating Robin. Tall Man shoots at <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> but Peniston interferes. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> injures Tall Man.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Chase {{arrives and}} helps Tall Man escape, but are pursued by <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> quickly gains <b>the</b> upper hand and almost kills Chase. Max uses Peniston's sound device to {{distract}} <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> It attacks him, but {{he uses a}} zipline to escape. Peniston takes the sound device and lures <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> into <b>the</b> pressure chamber. Dr. Chase urges Peniston not {{to stay in the}} pressure chamber with <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> but Peniston refuses to leave saying he can't let <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> die alone. Dr. Chase locks them in and activates it, building greater and greater pressure. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> kills Peniston. Chase allows the pressure to build up very high then smashes the window causing all the air to come out. This causes explosive decompression and <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> explodes, finally killing it. Later, the survivors walk into the sun set ready to board the boat, presumably to go back to town and never return to the island.|$|R
5|$|As {{the others}} plot to destroy <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees {{the station and}} finds <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> in a nearby cave. After {{consuming}} Wyman's brain, <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> claims is <b>the</b> only way to truly save humanity. Upon realizing <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is forcing <b>the</b> will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|R
5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing <b>the</b> <b>creatures,</b> the only thing he is capable of doing.|$|E
5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{takes place}} on a {{spaceship}} in the Barrier Peaks mountain range of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. In the adventure's introduction, it is explained that the Grand Duchy of Geoff is under constant attack by a succession of monsters that have been emerging from a cave in the mountains. The Grand Duke of Geoff has hired the characters to discover the origin of <b>the</b> <b>creatures,</b> and stop their incursions.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} this recent attack, Lutz confronts Jones again who then admits that a highly {{radioactive}} creature is responsible. It’s revealed that the town is {{home to one of}} 2,000 nuclear dump sites in the U.S. and <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> (who is implied to be young Michael Smith) is the resulting mutation due to repeated exposure to the site’s radioactive materials. The mutant, while intelligent, is completely psychotic and sensitive to light and is inactive during the day. Arming themselves with shotguns the two eventually manage to track <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> down to an abandoned warehouse where they are stalked by the hungry mutant. Jones is soon attacked and disemboweled by <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> leaving Lutz alone to fend off <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> Donning a gas mask, Lutz attempts to kill <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> with poison gas but it seems unfazed by the poisonous fumes and tosses Lutz around like a ragdoll. As <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> advances Lutz manages to toss a beaker of acid into <b>the</b> <b>creature’s</b> face momentarily stunning it. Taking advantage of <b>the</b> <b>creature’s</b> distraction, Lutz grabs a nearby axe and hacks <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> to death, ending <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> reign of terror. However a new mutation is seen bursting from the ground as the credits roll.|$|R
50|$|After night comes, Randy {{turns to}} <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> and contemplates that <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> colors {{will take the}} pain out of being consumed. Randy does not look away as <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> shimmers hues at him, and the story ends.|$|R
5000|$|Photo Energy: Whenever <b>the</b> <b>{{creature}}</b> {{with this}} ability {{is put into}} the battle zone, if a creature of a certain race is tapped in the mana zone to summon <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> gains <b>the</b> Photo Energy ability.|$|R
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b> Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the Great Depression until the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, rabbits became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> under control. The trapping of rabbits and auctioning of their skins in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area's economy during this time.|$|E
5|$|More recently, giant spiders have {{featured}} in {{books such as}} the 1998 fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling. This book was later followed by a motion picture of the same name, using the giant spider Aragog from the novel as a supporting character and pet of grounds keeper, Hagrid. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a book about many of <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> within the Harry Potter universe, these giant spiders are also known as Acromantulas.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>creature</b> {{was first}} {{depicted}} {{on the cover}} of the original first edition Manual of the Planes (Jeff Grubb, 1987). Although the book contained no statistics for <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> it did make mention of <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> as an [...] "ethereal dreadnought".|$|R
5|$|Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain {{falling from}} a clear sky— a sunshower— is called kitsune no yomeiri or the kitsune's wedding, in {{reference}} to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> being held during such conditions. The event is considered a good omen, but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests, as is depicted in the 1990 Akira Kurosawa film Dreams.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>creatures</b> {{each have}} unique {{cultural}} identities {{and a sense}} of loyalty towards their inherent, traditional practices. The main characters comprise a royal family that includes King Ploobis, Queen Peuta, and a male child named Wiss. There are also a male servant named Scred, a female servant named Vazh, and a rock prophet named the Mighty Favog. Scred acts like a fervent supporter of dim-witted King Ploobis, while Vazh displays flirtatious qualities.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to base <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E
50|$|Corrosive Form - The Second Form {{takes place}} after a shadow has eaten <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> from <b>the</b> inside out. In this form, the shadow makes {{the spirit and}} flesh of <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> its own. <b>The</b> shadow is free to take two {{separate}} shapes in this form, either <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> normal shape or its shadow shape. It has no time limitation or dependence on <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> shadow.|$|R
500|$|Crater {{refuses to}} help them {{identify}} <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> so Kirk orders the fake [...] "McCoy" [...] to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock's Vulcan blood made him incompatible with <b>the</b> <b>creature's</b> needs. Back in its [...] "Nancy" [...] form, <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> goes to McCoy's quarters. Kirk arrives with a phaser to provoke <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> into attacking. McCoy gets in the way, giving <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to attack Kirk. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk. McCoy opens fire with his phaser. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> changes back {{into the shape of}} [...] "Nancy" [...] to plead [...] for its life as McCoy continues firing and kills it. As Enterprise leaves orbit, Kirk comments, with a degree of compassion, that this creature—the last of its kind—was probably not inherently evil, but simply desperate.|$|R
2500|$|Realizing <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> {{does not}} target unarmed prey {{because there is}} [...] "no sport", Dutch sends Anna to the {{helicopter}} unarmed. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> pursues Dutch through a river, causing its cloaking device to malfunction.
