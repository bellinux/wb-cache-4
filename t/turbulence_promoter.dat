Flow fluid characteristic was numerically simulated, {{and the effect of}} <b>turbulence</b> <b>promoter</b> geometry on flow pattern was evaluated. The principle of field synergy was used to analyze the mechanism of enhancing permeation behavior. The result showed the strength of flow instability was greater promoted by square bar <b>turbulence</b> <b>promoter</b> than by cylinder <b>turbulence</b> <b>promoter.</b> The reduction of the intersection angle between velocity vector and applied pressure could enhance flow instability, and the effects of the geometries on the flow pattern could be well described by the field synergy principle. It could be concluded that the strength of instabilities was determined not only by velocity but also by the synergy degree between velocity vector and applied pressure. The smaller was the intersection angle, the greater was the permeation velocity. The application of field synergy principle might improve membrane process and obtain excellent mass transfer result...|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) model for the turbulence promoter-assisted crossflow microfiltration (CFMF) process was successfully established, in which the inlet velocity, transmembrane pressure (TMP) and feed concentration were taken as inputs, and the flux improvement efficiency (FIE) by <b>turbulence</b> <b>promoter</b> was taken as output. Using the trained ANN model, the FIE can be predicted under CFMF operation conditions that {{are not included in}} the training database. It reveals that the FIE first increases and then decreases with increasing either TMP or inlet velocity, and increases with increasing feed concentration. Among three input variables, TMP has the most important effect on the FIE. The optimization of MP operation conditions was largely dependent on the feed concentration. The high FIE can be obtained by exerting both high inlet velocity (> 0. 7 m/s) and low TMP (0. 7 m/s) and high IMP (> 70 kPa) at a relatively high feed concentration (> 8 g/L).
