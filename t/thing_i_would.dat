[...] This quickly {{gave rise to a}} fan-run initiative to raising the funds to purchase the rights. On March 7, 2011, the organizers announced the closure of the project due to lack of endorsement from the creators, with $1 million pledged {{at the time it was}} shut down.|$|E
500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E

She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} <b>thing...</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E

[...] Previously on Good Morning America, when asked about President Obama's origins, she replied, [...] "Well, that isn't for me to state. That's for the president to state." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Young—SCLC {{activist and}} official, and later U.S. congressman, {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, and mayor of Atlanta—told The Washington Post that the depiction {{of the relationship between}} Johnson and King [...] "was the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> question in the movie. Everything else, they got 100 percent right". According to Young, the two were always mutually respectful, and King respected Johnson's political problems. On television, Young pointed out that it was US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy who had signed the order that allowed the FBI to monitor King and other SCLC members and that it happened before Johnson took office.|$|E

And [...] pretty soon I could deal with the advantages of a different cross - he ought to have at least two. He ought to have at least three so he could make a choice each day of which one. It's pretty hard to express a psychotic pattern of behavior over an ever-increasing number of crosses.|$|E

The version hidden in <b>Things</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Do is the clean version where the word 's**t' is censored and all the gaps are filled, while in the single version it is a little more explicit and there are 30 second gaps where only the instrumental can be heard.|$|R

He responded [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have liked to be is an academic specialising in Greek poetry. I love Greek poetry. I can read Ancient Greek but never had the chance to develop my interest." [...] Singh is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Singh has also expressed his views writing in The Guardian on how 'Asians should not be prejudged because of the way we look' following a personal experience on the London Underground following the 7 July 2005 London bombings.|$|E
2500|$|The album, {{originally}} {{set for a}} Fall release, {{was pushed}} forward and released on July 1, 2014, five weeks {{after the release of}} its lead single. Paula peaked at #9 on the Billboard 200, and sold 24,000 copies in its first week of release. In a 2015 interview with Jody Rosen of The New York Times, Thicke expressed both embarrassment over his public dedications and regret over giving the album a commercial release, stating, [...] "my record company didn’t want me to put it out, but they stuck by me. In hindsight, the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done differently was, I wouldn’t have promoted it or sold it. I would have given it away." [...] Speaking with radio station Hot 97, Thicke remarked further on the album's reception saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, after rioting in Japan {{forced the}} {{unexpected}} collapse of President Dwight D.

Griffin reassured newsmen {{that there was no}} indication of any unusual activity {{on the part of the}} Chinese Communists, but added that the motto of the Fleet was readiness and in the event of any threat the Fleet was ready to strike; in particular, should any submarine make any hostile move against the President and his escort force, he would do his best to destroy it.

My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E
