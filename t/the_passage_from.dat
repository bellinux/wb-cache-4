In this way, the ships {{were able to}} compare their respective instruments, and {{the master of the}} Arniston was able to learn his longitude too, as long as he remained in the convoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{short cut}} of the German ships is via the English Channel. It is 240 miles from Brest to Cherbourg and another 120 miles from Cherbourg to the Dover straits. While ships could make <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>from</b> Brest to Cherbourg or from Cherbourg to the Dover straits in the same dark period, they could not make the {{complete}} passage from Brest to Dover in one dark period.|$|E

5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. <b>The</b> <b>passage</b> <b>from</b> the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} {{includes}} several essays on original sin {{and the fall}} of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology. In Calvin's view, sin began {{with the fall of}} Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil. Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived {{during the time of the}} Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the New Covenant using <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>from</b> the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge the living and the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the {{subjects}} that the coladeira talks about are satires, social criticism, jokes and playful and happy themes. According to C. Gonçalves, the original {{themes of the}} Boa Vista morna were precisely these ones. But after the thematic change in <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>from</b> the Boa Vista morna to the Brava morna, the emerging genre coladeira would have taken over the initial thematic of the Boa Vista morna.
