40|$|M. Tech. Electrical Engineering. Our {{topic of}} {{interest}} is fault analysis in electrical power systems and our wish is to contribute in the fault diagnostics technology by developing, testing and implementing a novel signal decomposition technique. To achieve this, the major point {{is to build a}} knowledge foundation regarding: - available information and how to get the right information, - existing equipment and - methods used for analysis. In this study are used fault records and other data relevant to fault analysis obtained from the utility. All data is recorded in a program called OSCOP (Siemens. 1999 : 2). To analyze it with signal decomposition method we have to convert these analogue recordings into a standard data format called Comtrade (IEEE 1991 : 3). The derivation of the signal decomposition method is presented in the dissertation. A number of real-life records are used for testing and verification. In the short circuit examples, the parameters of fundamental frequency and exponentially decaying DC offset have been calculated with high accuracy. We have tested the method in the analysis of inrush currents present in the system during <b>transformer</b> <b>energization</b> process. Very accurate power swing frequencies are calculated using the voltage signal recorded during a major disturbance in the utility Transmission Network. An excellent example in using the proposed method is the estimation of resonant frequencies on the line with shunt reactor compensation. Here the method showed a clear advantage over the existing Discrete Fourier Transform method. Extracted resonant frequencies are in the range 30 Hz to 45 Hz. This information, so far, wasn’t available directly from measurements. The method can play a very important role as a part of automated fault and disturbance analysis. The method can perform feature extraction as a pre-processing stage of automatic fault selection and event recognition. Events that can be automatically recognised are: resonant conditions on compensated lines, power swing, <b>transformer</b> <b>energization,</b> re-striking event, CT saturation, Ferranti effect and all other very specific wave distortions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Transformer is {{the most}} {{important}} equipment of the electrical power system. At the time of <b>transformer</b> <b>energization</b> high current is drawn by the transformer known as the inrush current. This current is nearly ten times more than the full load current of transformer. It produces mechanical stress on transformer and also affects the windings and bushings of the transformer. The large switching transient current affects malfunction of protection system of power system and the different equipments connected to system. So the inrush current should be minimized. There are different methods used to minimize the inrush current such as volt second balance, series compensator, point on wave switching method etc. This paper focuses on point on wave switching method. It also explains the results for inrush current of three phase transformer with and without point on wave switching method. A test is driven on 450 kVA, 500 kV/ 230 kV grounded Y/D transformer in MATLAB/SIMLINK environment. It also focuses on power quality issues associated with transformer at no load condition...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{very high}} inrush {{currents}} in <b>transformers</b> during <b>energization</b> may create deep voltage sag causing malfunction to electronic and other loads. In high voltage power system star-delta transformers are generally switched in, one by one, producing inrush currents each time. The inrush current may be reduced by sequential phase <b>energization</b> of each <b>transformer</b> with neutral resistors. This paper suggests that sequential phase energization should be carried out on the first transformer only after paralleling the delta secondary of all the transformers. This procedure eliminates inrush currents in all the remaining transformers without too much increase in the inrush of the first transformer...|$|R
40|$|Inrush {{current is}} a very {{important}} phenomenon which occurs in <b>transformer</b> during <b>energization</b> at no load. It depends on several factors like magnetizing properties of magnetic material, resistant and inductance of primary winding, supply frequency, switching angle of circuit breaker, applied voltage etc. Objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the maximum value of transformer inrush current. Measurement of inrush current is difficult issue for large rating of transformer under different switching conditions. Therefore this study is used to demonstrate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for modeling and simulation. This helps in prediction of maximum inrush current for large rating of transformer. Back Propagation with Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm was used to train the ANN architecture and same was tested for the various data sets. For effective training of ANN various operating conditions are considered. These are Transformer VA rating, Applied Voltage, switching angle and Remnant flux. This study was carried out to develop ANN model in a generalize manner which can be utilize for predicting maximum value of current and harmonic for any single phase transformer provide core material and frequency remains same...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the ultrasaturation {{phenomenon}} of power <b>transformers</b> during their <b>energization</b> is studied. It is shown that under special conditions, the currents observed after transformer switching on {{do not contain}} enough restraining information (e. g., second harmonic), which may lead to protection maloperation. This paper concentrates on a thorough explanation {{of the problem and}} possible causes of ultrasaturation. Theoretical investigations are supported and illustrated with simulation studies performed both with MATLAB and Electromagnetic Transients Program–Alternative Transients Program. The outcomes of this research can further be used as hints for substation operation personnel {{as well as for the}} development of new protection stabilization criteria, which is not discussed further in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Any {{power quality}} {{disturbance}} waveform {{can be seen}} as superimposition of various oscillating modes. It becomes necessary to separate different components of single frequency or narrow band of frequencies from a non stationary signal to identify the causes which contribute to power quality disturbances. In this paper a method is proposed to detect and classify voltage sag causes based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with Hilbert Transform (called Hilbert-Huang Transform) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). The key feature of EMD is to decompose a non stationary signal into mono component signals called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Further the Hilbert transform of each IMF provides frequency information evolving with time and variation in magnitude and phase due to oscillation at different time scales and locations. The characteristic features of the first three IMFs of each disturbance waveform are obtained. Finally PNN is used to classify the characteristic features for identification of voltage sag causes. Three voltage sag causes are taken for classification (i) Three phase short circuit (ii) Starting of induction motor and (iii) Three phase <b>transformer</b> <b>energization.</b> Results show that the classifier can detect and classify the voltage sag causes efficiently...|$|E
40|$|Transformers {{connected}} at the medium-voltage {{level in}} cable grids, such as wind park collection grids and industrial grids, {{are exposed to}} the stress of very fast transients. These electric transients are mainly generated during breaker switching operations and the rise time of the transient voltage in such systems is much shorter compared to the rise times of transients generated in transmission systems at a high-voltage level. In this paper, the internal voltage stress is studied during very fast transients generated during <b>transformer</b> <b>energization.</b> Instead of using a breaker, the energizing tests are performed using a low-impedance pulse generator that can generate lightning impulse-shaped waveforms and voltage steps with rise times varying between 35 and 500 ns. Experiments show that during very fast transients with a 35 -ns rise time and 1 -p. u. magnitude, the interturn voltage exceeds the level obtained with a lightning impulse-shaped voltage waveform of 4. 4 pu. Furthermore, during a specific switching scenario with delta-connected transformers, where the winding is excited from both ends, the same 1 -p. u. / 35 -ns voltage step generates an interturn voltage that exceeds the 1 -p. u. level, which is more than 2. 5 times higher voltage stress than during a lightning impulse test...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — At {{the time}} of <b>transformer</b> <b>energization,</b> a high current will be drawn by the transformer. This current is called {{transient}} inrush current and it may rise to ten times the nominal full load current of transformer during operation. Energization transient can produce mechanical stress in the transformer causes protection system mal-function. This current often affects the power system quality and may disrupt the operation of sensitive electrical loads such as computer and medical equipment connected to the system. Reduction {{and the way to}} control energization transient currents have become important concerns to the power industry. Conventionally, controlled switching or point on wave switching was the method being used to counter the problem, but this method requires the knowledge of residual fluxes of transformer before energization, which was quite tedious to get. Hence, this paper proposes a technique to mitigate inrush current in three phase transformers which involves injecting some amount of DC flux in the primary of transformer, the process known as prefluxing. After setting the initial fluxes of the transformer it is energized by conventional controlled switching. To verify the efficientness of the proposed prefluxing method to mitigate inrush current for power transformer, a MATLAB simulation model is designed and developed. The results are verified using the sample in which transformer is connect with a supply source, which have conformed the efficient inrush current control.

40|$|During {{the course}} of a transformer's {{operational}} life, it experiences many challenges to its insulation. Chemical stresses, such as moisture in insulating oil, deteriorate insulation chemically. Mechanical stresses and thermal stresses, such as those experienced during a large external fault, also contribute to weakening a transformer's insulation. Once these stresses have weakened the insulation to the point of breakdown, a fault may occur between windings of the transformer. These faults, known as turn-to-turn faults, are difficult to detect electrically at the terminals of the transformer until they have grown to the point of damaging the transformer beyond repair. Current differential transformer protection is a simple, reliable, and cost effect method of detecting turn-to-turn faults. This method of protection is only able to detect faults involving 10 % of the windings or more. The sensitivity of current differential protection is limited as not to cause false tripping due to normal imbalances in current. Such imbalances in current may occur when a tapchanger is used to increase or decrease the voltage {{on one side of the}} transformer. Digital current differential relays, which monitor tap changer position, compensate for current imbalances due to tapchanger operation. Other causes of current imbalance include current transformer saturation, magnetizing inrush current, and over-excitation. A transformer is designed to operate continuously at 10 % above its rated voltage. In this overexcited state, a current imbalance appears which causes a differential current to be sensed by the current differential relay. This limits the current differential relay's sensitivity as it must be designed to ignore current imbalances due to the aforementioned causes. The current differential transformer protection algorithm, which only makes use of the current magnitude, is based on the principles of an electromechanical relay. Digital relays are capable of computing the negative sequence current on both primary and secondary sides of the transformer along with the phase difference between these two negative sequence currents. By using both phase and magnitude information, negative sequence current could be used to detect turn-to-turn faults involving 3 % of the transformer's windings or more. Turn-to-turn faults may still occur even if no current is flowing on one side of the transformer, such as during energization. With no current flowing in the secondary windings of the transformer, negative sequence current based algorithms become insensitive. A transformer is particularly likely to experience a turn-to-turn fault during this time due to the stresses of energization. This thesis introduces a relay prototype, using both negative sequence current and negative sequence voltage, which retains its sensitivity during energization. This prototype was constructed using a micro-controller and an analog-to-digital conversion board. The transformer protection relay algorithm, including all hardware interface code and signal processing code, was then designed to suit the prototype's hardware. A 3 -phase transformer real-time simulation model, capable of simulating turn-to-turn faults as well as the magnetic properties of the transformer's core, was developed. The voltage and current waveforms generated by the transformer model, running in the real-time simulator, were used to test the relay prototype. The sensitivity and speed of the relay algorithm proposed in this thesis was then tested, for faults involving 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 25 % of the windings along with two commonly encountered transformer winding configurations. The relay's performance for several commonly encountered system scenarios such as over-excitation, current transformer saturation, non-zero fault resistance, <b>transformer</b> <b>energization,</b> and external faults were also examined for several turn-to-turn fault severities. A fault resistance of one Ohm is typical for transformer turn-to-turn faults. These test results were compared to current differential protection with second harmonic restraint. The experimental results presented in this work indicate that the algorithm proposed in this thesis is faster and more sensitive than restrained current differential protection and capable of detecting turn-to-turn faults occurring during <b>transformer</b> <b>energization...</b>|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this licentiate thesis is fast faultdetection. The thesis {{summaries}} the work performed in theproject 9 ̆ 3 Fast fault detection for distributionsystems 9 ̆ 4. In the first {{chapters of the}} thesis the term 9 ̆ 3 fast 9 ̆ 4 is used in a general manner. The term is laterdefined based upon considerations and conclusions made in thefirst chapters and then related to a specific time. To {{be able to understand}} and appreciate why fast faultdetection is necessary, power system faults and theirconsequences are briefly discussed. The consequences of a faultare dependent of a number of different factors, one of thefactors being the duration of the fault. The importance of the speed of the fault detection dependson the type of equipment used to clear the fault. A circuitbreaker which interrupt currents only when they pass through anatural zero crossing might be less dependent on the speed ofthe fault detection than a fault current limiter which limitsthe fault current before it has reached its first prospectivecurrent peak. In {{order to be able to}} detect a fault in a power system, thepower system must be observed, i. e., measurements of relevantquantities must be performed so that the fault detectionequipment can obtain information of the state of the system. The fault detection equipment and some general methods of faultdetection are briefly described. Some algorithms and their possible adaptation to fast faultdetection are described. A common principle of many algorithmsare that they assume that either a signal or the power systemobject can be described by a model. Sampled data values arethen fitted to the model so that an estimate of relevantparameters needed for fault detection is obtained. An algorithmwhich do not fit samples to a model but use instantaneouscurrent values for fault detection is also described andevaluated. Since the exact state of a power system never is known dueto variations in power production and load, a model of thepower system or of the signal can never be perfect, i. e., theestimated parameter can never be truly correct. Furthermore,errors from the data acquisition system contribute to the totalerror of the estimated parameter. Two case studies are used to study the performance of the(modified) algorithms. For those studies it has been shown thatthe algorithms can detect a fault within approximately 1 msafter fault inception and that one of the algorithms candiscriminate between a fault and two types of common powersystem transients (capacitor and <b>transformer</b> <b>energization).</b> The second case study introduced a system with two sourceswhich required a directional algorithm to discriminate betweenfaults inside or outside the protection zone. It is concluded that under certain assumptions it ispossible to detect power system faults within approximately 1 msand that it is possible to discriminate a power system faultfrom power system transient that regularly occurs within powersystems but which not are faults.

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Energization of large power transformers {{are subject to}} many transients that may complicate the successful completion of this process and ultimately reduce the expected life of these critical components. The first-time energization (commissioning), subsequent energizations (operational), methods of energization (abrupt or controlled energizations from the high voltage or low voltage winding) and the possibility/improbability of these transformers being preloaded all affect the transformer’s longevity. The consequences of such energizations during the conditions are inrush currents and voltage stresses on the affected components {{that may not be}} foremost on the designer’s mind. The designer may be more concerned with proper parameter application and not the effects of commissioning and operation on these massive components. These behemoths are a bit akin to elephants whose longevity is dependent on the sum of their life experiences and the scars they endure during this period. The reliability of electric system is directly affected by these series connected behemoths. The construction of power transformers has been optimized by the advent of computers (especially finite analyses) to the point that stray flux, eddy current, hysteresis loss and harmonic loss (embodied and represented within the non-linear Rₚ element and known as “core Watt losses”) have all attained significant improvements witnessed by their 99. 8 + percent efficiency. The difficulties that remain are magnetizing inrush and remanence embodied within Xₚ which occur dependent on three parameters. The parameters are primary resistance Rₛ (dependent on the location of same for the equivalent circuit used), the time dependent voltage at the point on the voltage wave when the transformer is energized (referred to as “Point of Wave”) and the remanent (or residual flux) and its polarity all at the instant of energization. The magnetizing inrush problem has been thoroughly researched and commercial products exist to mitigate such difficulties by control system add-ons. This research recognizes that knowledge of Point on Wave has effectively mitigated the problems with <b>transformer</b> <b>energization</b> at zero voltage. The results obtained after hundreds of runs confirms a direct relationship between the point of the wave where current is extinguished for a fast acting air switch and minimal to zero remanence flux in a single-phase shell form transformer. This minimal to zero residual flux appears {{at the peak of the}} equivalent sinusoidal current wave (increasing or decreasing) without the effects of saturation. The conclusion of the experimental runs was that the use of multiple Hall-Effect transducers (multiple installations suggested for manufacturing errors or wiring failures) within the laminations of a transformer which would be used to confirm the near zero remanent flux once the current was extinguished as described above. These findings and recommendations are still subject to testing at nameplate loads of varying power factors upon three phase transformers of shell and core constructions.
