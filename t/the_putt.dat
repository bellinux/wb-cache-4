5|$|The 1967 match {{continued}} {{the trend of}} American victories, as the United States won 23½–8½ at Champions Golf Club. Unlike in previous years, the 1969 match was much closer. The match {{came down to the}} last hole of the final singles match between American Jack Nicklaus and British golfer Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded <b>the</b> <b>putt,</b> picking up Jacklin's ball marker. As a result their match was tied, as was the contest at 16–16. The United States won again in 1971, beating Great Britain 18½–13½. The 1973 match was the first held in Scotland at Muirfield. The outcome remained the same as Great Britain lost 19–13. The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two days now consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.|$|E

He is the eighth most successful European golfer on points scored, with the second highest scoring rate.|$|E

2500|$|... 2004 {{was another}} {{successful}} year as Els won 6 times on both tours, including big wins at Memorial, WGC-American Express Championship and his sixth World Match Play Championship, a new record. His success {{did not stop}} there. Els showed remarkable consistency in the Majors but lost to Phil Mickelson in the Masters when Mickelson birdied the 18th for the title, finished ninth in the U.S. Open after playing in the final group with friend and fellow countryman Retief Goosen and surprisingly lost in a playoff in the Open to the then unknown Todd Hamilton. Els had a [...] putt for birdie on the final hole of regulation for the Open at Royal Troon, but he missed <b>the</b> <b>putt</b> and lost in the playoff. Els ended the major season with a fourth-place finish in the PGA Championship, where a three-putt on the 72nd hole would cost him {{a place in the}} playoff. In total, Els had 16 top-10 finishes, a second European Order of Merit title in succession and a second-place finish on the United States money list.|$|E
