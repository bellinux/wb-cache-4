25|$|Proponents of the RMA {{argue that}} it ensures the {{sustainable}} use of resources for the foreseeable needs of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> generation, and also recognises the importance of indigenous rights in the mitigation process. In this respect, the RMA is a pioneering act {{in the area of}} sustainable development. Other advantages cited are the umbrella function, which (at least in theory) allows all consent decisions about a project to be considered in one process, freeing applicants from the need to research and apply for all the various permits they would otherwise have to apply for their development. It is also noted that the RMA is 'effects-based'. In other words, instead of a proposal needing to be on a list of approved or permitted developments or activities, if the applicant can prove that the 'effects' of the development on the environment are unproblematic, then he or she is allowed to go ahead. In practice however, this proof is often elusive, especially with new or contested activities or developments.|$|E

25|$|One notable {{criticism}} of penal substitution {{raised by the}} moral influence perspective concerns God's forgiveness. The moral influence framework depicts God as concerned about only <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> states of people's moral character, and not their past states. God desires people to become more loving. When people truly change, God is no longer concerned with their previous character and thus is willing to freely forgive their previous actions. The moral influence framework thus teaches that God's forgiveness is free and conditional only on repentance (i.e. moral change). This link between repentance and forgiveness is well-attested to in the New Testament. By contrast, moral influence advocates argue that the penal substitutionary theory portrays God as {{unable or unwilling to}} forgive wrong actions and requiring that there be full and complete punishment for all past wrongs, regardless of repentance. They often critique this idea on biblical grounds, pointing to numerous biblical instances of forgiveness and verses that appear to teach that forgiveness depends on repentance. Many also argue that penal substitution's depiction of God as demanding full punishment for every crime regardless of repentance is morally reprehensible and does not reflect a loving, forgiving God.|$|E

The review added that while he [...] "takes {{a long time to get}} there, and arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E
40|$|Equal {{treatment}} for <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> was required in two axioms {{for sustainable development}} introduced by the author.

The "weight" 'lambda' given to the long run future is identified with the marginal utility of the nvironmental asset along a path that narrowly avoids extinction. An existence theorem is provided for optimizing according to the welfare criterion that treats equally <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> We show that no prior welfare criteria satisfy the axioms for sustainable development introduced in [12].
