5|$|Miller <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> Laker {{for another}} six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted {{for his ability}} to break {{partnerships}} with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by striking a four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg stump, challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg stump and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball off the back of his bat onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at short fine leg.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E

5|$|The McCanns began a libel {{action against}} Amaral and his {{publisher}} in 2009. Madeleine's Fund covered the legal fees. In 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages; Amaral's appeal against that decision succeeded in 2016. A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or {{sales of the}} book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral's freedom of expression. The ban was reinstated in 2015 {{as part of the}} libel ruling, <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> when Amaral's appeal succeeded in 2016. The McCanns' appealed the 2016 decision to Portugal's Supreme Court, but the court ruled against them in February 2017; in their 76-page ruling, the judges wrote that the McCanns had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008. In March 2017 the Supreme Court rejected the McCanns' final appeal.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian troops {{raised their}} {{national}} flag {{on the eastern}} bank of the canal at 14:35. By that time company and battalion-size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line, but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes. Those tanks that broke through came under fire {{from the west bank}} ramparts. At 14:45, a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank. Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen-minute intervals. However, after the fourth wave, fatigue and technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals. The Egyptians abandoned their schedules, giving priority to anti-tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle. Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment. The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats, where they were initially lifted {{to the top of the}} sand wall with their loads. However, this method proved clumsy, and the carts were first emptied <b>then</b> <b>lifted,</b> after which they were re-loaded and dragged to troops on the front line. The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matériel on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|The Exeter Township snow emergency, {{which was}} {{declared}} on the 14th, was extended through 4 PM on the 15th.

Across the Lehigh Valley: In Lehigh County, The city of Allentown declared a snow emergency early on the 14th, which was <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> at 8 PM on the 14th. The weight of snow and ice, on the 14th, brought down the dome over the swimming pool at the West End Racquet and Fitness Club in South Whitehall Township. The dome itself was destroyed. Also, the Brookside Country Club in Wescosville also reported dome damage {{as a result of}} the snow and ice. In Northampton County, an 83-year-old woman was found dead on the rear porch of her home from hypothermia. Also in Bethlehem, a pedestrian was hospitalized after a private snowplow operator backed over him while clearing the Sheetz gas station parking lot at 3201 Schoenersville Road on the 14th. County Emergency Dispatch officials reported about a dozen or so minor vehicle accidents due to the slippery conditions. The snow and ice was too much on the 15th for a dome covering a soccer field at the Iron Lakes Sports Club on Shankweiler Road in North Whitehall that it collapsed.|$|E

5|$|The Leafs {{finished}} {{in first place}} {{at the end of}} the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy faked once, moved in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck to go down, <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> the puck over him. In the finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.|$|E

25|$|A close, rain-damaged {{match at}} County Cricket Ground, Hove {{eventually}} ended in Surrey Lions snaring a last-ball victory over Sussex Sharks.

A 28-ball fifty from Ali Brown <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> Surrey to 74 for 1, but two run outs saw them lose their next four wickets for eight runs.

25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} {{interior layout}} was {{a compromise between}} the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new ro-ro car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was already out of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged {{the match}} between Somerset and Lancashire {{allowing}} little {{play on the}} first three days. Between the showers, Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, but the little play that was possible after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked more than likely, even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was {{a full day of}} cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe <b>then</b> <b>lifted</b> Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.|$|E
