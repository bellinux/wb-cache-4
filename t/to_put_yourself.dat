It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> on display all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>yourself</b> in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

5000|$|In one of {{the many}} {{wonderful}} moments in Think Like a Freak, Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner ask the question: Who is easier to fool—kids or adults? The obvious answer, of course, is kids. The cliché is about taking candy from a baby, not a grown man. But instead of accepting conventional wisdom as fact, the two sit down with the magician Alex Stone—someone in the business of fooling people—and ask him what he thinks. And his answer? Adults.Think Like a Freak is not a book about how to understand magic tricks. That’s what Dubner and Levitt’s first two books—Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics—were about. It’s about the attitude we need to take towards the tricks and the problems that the world throws at us. Dubner and Levitt have a set of prescriptions about what that attitude comes down to, but at its root it comes down <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> <b>yourself</b> {{in the mind of the}} child, gazing upwards at the double lift: free yourself from expectations, be prepared for a really really simple explanation, and let your attention wander from time to time. —Malcolm Gladwell reviewing Think Like a Freak on Amazon.com ...|$|R
