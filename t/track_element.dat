40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in the design, construction and utilization of rubber tracks for agriculture and earth moving machinery has increased considerably. The development of such types of tracks was initiated by the efforts to invent a more environmentally friendly vehicle-terrain system. These tracks are also {{the result of the}} continuous effort to develop more cost-effective traction systems. A rubber-surfaced and friction-based prototype track was developed and mounted on the patented modification of a new Allis Chalmers four wheel drive tractor. The track is propelled by smooth pneumatic tyres by means of rubber-rubber friction and the tractive effort of the track is mainly generated by soil-rubber friction between the rubber surface of the track elements and terrain. The experimental track layer tractor, based on an Allis Chalmers 8070 tractor (141 kW) was tested on concrete and on cultivated sandy loam soil at 7. 8 %; 13 % and 21 % soil water content. The contact pressure and the tangential force on an instrumented <b>track</b> <b>element,</b> as well as the total torque input to one track, was simultaneously recorded during the drawbar pull-slip tests. Soil characteristics for pressure-sinkage and friction-displacement were obtained from the field tests by using an instrumented linear shear and soil sinkage device. By applying the approach based on the classical bevameter technique, analytical methods were implemented for modelling the traction performance of the prototype track system. Different possible pressure distribution profiles under the tracks were considered and compared to the recorded data. Two possible traction models were proposed, one constant pressure model, for minimal inward track deflection and the other a flexible track model with inward deflection and a higher contact pressure at both the front free-wheeling and rear driving tyres. For both models, the traction force was mainly generated by rubber-soil friction and adhesion with limited influence by soil shear. For individual track elements, close agreement between the measured and predicted contact pressure and traction force was observed based on the flexible track model. The recorded and calculated values of the coefficient of traction based on the summation of the traction force for the series of track elements were comparable to the values predicted from modelling. However, the measured values of drawbar pull coefficient were considerably lower than the predicted values, largely caused by internal track friction in addition to energy dissipated by soil compaction. The tractive efficiency for soft surface was also unacceptably low, probably due to the high internal track friction and the low travel speeds applied for the tests. The research undertaken identified and confirmed a model to be used to predict contact pressure and tangential stresses for a single <b>track</b> <b>element.</b> It was capable of predicting the tractive performance for different possible contact pressure values.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate one of major causes of damages, which {{is attributed to}} the resonant behaviours, in a railway track and its components. Basically, when a railway track is excited to generalised dynamic loading, the railway track deforms and then vibrates for certain duration. Dynamic responses of the railway track and its components {{are the key to}} evaluate the structural capacity of railway track and its components. If a dynamic loading resonates the railway track’s dynamic responses, its components tend to have the significant damage from excessive dynamic stresses. For example, a rail vibration could lead to defects in rails or wheels. The track vibrations can cause the crack damage in railway sleepers or fasteners, or even the breakage of ballast support. Therefore, the identification of dynamic properties of railway track and its components is imperative, in order to avoid any train operation that might trigger such resonances. This chapter deals with the vibration measurement techniques and the dynamic behaviours of ballasted railway tracks, and in particular their major components. It describes the concept of vibration measurements and the understanding into the dynamic behaviour of ballasted railtrack sleepers. It discusses briefly on the track structures and track components in order to provide the foundation of understanding ballasted railway tracks.

40|$|Some {{cyanobacteria}} {{are capable}} of differentiating a variety of cell types in response to environmental factors. For instance, in low nitrogen conditions, some cyanobacteria form heterocysts, which are specialized for N 2 fixation. Many heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria have DNA elements interrupting key N 2 fixation genes, elements that are excised during heterocyst differentiation. While the mechanism for the excision of the element has been well-studied, many questions remain regarding {{the introduction of the}} elements into the cyanobacterial lineage and whether they have been retained ever since or have been lost and reintroduced. To examine the evolutionary relationships and possible function of DNA sequences that interrupt genes of heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, we identified and compared 101 interruption element sequences within genes from 38 heterocyst-forming cyanobacterial genomes. The interruption element lengths ranged from about 1 kb (the minimum able to encode the recombinase responsible for element excision), up to nearly 1 Mb. The recombinase gene sequences served as genetic markers that were common across the interruption elements and were used to <b>track</b> <b>element</b> evolution. Elements were found that interrupted 22 different orthologs, only five of which had been previously observed to be interrupted by an element. Most of the newly identified interrupted orthologs encode proteins that have been shown to have heterocyst-specific activity. However, the presence of interruption elements within genes with no known role in N 2 fixation, as well as in three non-heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, indicates that the processes that trigger the excision of elements may not be limited to heterocyst development or that the elements move randomly within genomes. This comprehensive analysis provides the framework to study the history and behavior of these unique sequences, and offers new insight regarding the frequency and persistence of interruption elements in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria...|$|E

In t roduct ion The "progressive'method of track fitting [1, 2] which {{is used in the}} data analysis program of the DELPHI collaboration has some substantial advantages as com-pared with other methods, in particular the "global" method [2]:- It is suitable for combined track finding and track fitting. No large matrices have to be inverted and the num-ber of computations increases linearly with the num-ber of measurements in the track. Therefore it is fast even in the presence of multiple scattering and many measurements. - The estimated track parameters follow closely the physical track. - The linear approximation of the track model needs to be valid only over a short range. The progressive method has, however, one funda-mental drawback: The track parameters are known with optimal precision only after the last step of the fit, i. e. usually at the inner end point of the track or track segment. In the presence of multiple scattering this has several consequences:- Predictions into detectors further outwards are not optimal. - The power of discrimination between measurements which may all belong to the track is rather poor at the begin of the track fit. - Since the aim of the track fit is the optimal knowl-edge of the track parameters as close to the vertex as possible, the fit has to proceed towards the interac-tion region. This effectively prohibits the use of the progressive method in the forward region of the DELPHI detector [3], where is it natural to proceed from the TPC with its good <b>track</b> <b>element</b> towards the forward drift chambers [3]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The geochemical {{characteristics}} of continental crust {{are present in}} nearly all arc magmas. These characteristics may reflect a specific source process, such as fluid fluxing, common to both arc magmas and the continental crust, and/or may reflect the incorporation of continental crust into arc magmas either at source via subducted sediment, or via contamination during differentiation. Resolving the relative mass contributions of juvenile, mantle-derived material, versus that derived from pre-existing crust of the upper plate, and providing these estimates on an element-by-element basis, is important because: (1) we want to constrain crustal growth rates; (2) we want to quantitatively <b>track</b> <b>element</b> cycling at convergent margins; and (3) we want to determine the origin of economically important elements and compounds. Traditional geochemical approaches for determining the contributions of various components to arc magmas are particularly successful when applied on a comparative basis. Studies of suites from multiple magmatic systems along arcs, for which differentiation effects can be individually constrained, {{can be used to}} extrapolate to potential source compositions. In the Lesser Antilles Arc, for example, differentiation trends from individual volcanoes are consistent with open-system evolution. However, such trends do not project back to a common primitive magma composition, suggesting that differentiation modifies magmas that were derived from distinct mantle sources. We propose that such approaches should now be complemented by petrographically constrained mineral-scale isotope and trace element analysis to unravel the contributing components to arc magmas. This innovative approach can: (1) better constrain true end-member compositions by returning wider ranges in geochemical compositions among constituent minerals than is found in whole rocks; (2) better determine magmatic evolution processes from core–rim isotopic or trace element profiles from the phases contained in magmas; and (3) constrain rates of differentiation by applying diffusion-controlled timescales to element profiles. An example from Nguaruhoe Volcano, New Zealand, underscores the importance of such a microsampling approach, showing that mineral isotopic compositions encompass wide ranges, that whole-rock isotopic compositions are consequently simply element-weighted averages of the heterogeneous crystal cargo, and that open-system evolution is proved by core–rim variations in Sr isotope ratios. Nguaruhoe {{is just one of many}} systems examined through microanalytical approaches. The overwhelming conclusion of these studies is that crystal cargoes are not truly phenocrystic, but are inherited from various sources. The implication of this realization is that the interpretation of whole-rock isotopic data, including the currently popular U-series, needs careful evaluation in the context of petrographic observations...|$|E
