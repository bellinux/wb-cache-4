5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} September 6, 2004 at Camperdown Studios in Miramar, New Zealand. Camperdown housed the native village and the Great Wall, while {{the streets of}} New York City were constructed on its backlot and at Gracefield in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. The majority of the SS Venture scenes were shot aboard a full-scale deck constructed in <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> Camperdown Studio and then were backed with a green screen, with the ocean digitally added in post. Scenes set in the Broadway theater from which King Kong makes his escape were filmed in Wellington's Opera House and at the Auckland Civic Theatre. Filming also took place at Stone Street Studios, where a new sound stage was constructed to accommodate one of the sets. Over the course of filming the budget went from $175 million to $207 million over additional visual effects work needed, and Jackson extending the film's running time by thirty minutes. Jackson covered the $32 million surplus himself and finished filming in March 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Throckmorton came to San Francisco in 1850 as {{an agent}} for an eastern mining {{business}} before working for Richardson. [...] As payment of a debt, Throckmorton acquired {{a large portion of}} Rancho Saucelito in 1853-4 and built his own rancho [...] "The Homestead" [...] on what is now Linden Lane and Montford Avenue. [...] The descendants of ranch superintendent Jacob Gardner continue to be active in Marin. [...] Some of the rest of his land was leased out for dairy farming to Portuguese settlers. A majority of the immigrants came from the Azores. Those who were unsuccessful at gold mining came north to the Marin Headlands and later brought their families. [...] In Mill Valley, Ranch [...] "B" [...] {{is one of the few}} remaining dairy farm buildings and is located near <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> the Tennessee Valley trailhead. Throckmorton also suffered devastating financial problems before his death in 1887. [...] His surname would later be applied to one of the major thoroughfares in Mill Valley. Richardson and Reed had never formalized the boundary lines separating their ranchos. Richardson's heirs successfully sued Reed's heirs in 1860 claiming the mill was built on their property. The border was officially marked as running along the Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio along present-day Miller Avenue. Everything to the east of the creek was Reed property, and everything to the west was Richardson land. It was Richardson's territory that would soon become part of Mill Valley when Throckmorton's daughter Suzanna was forced to relinquish several thousand acres to the San Francisco Savings & Union Bank to satisfy a debt of $100,000 against the estate in 1889.|$|E
2500|$|Plans for {{construction}} of an office building on the Federal Triangle parking lot site found support in 1986. The Federal City Council, a private civic organization which had been promoting {{the construction of a}} $200 million international trade center in the District of Columbia, advocated construction of its proposed building at Federal Triangle. Reagan administration officials favored the plan, and in October 1986 the proposal received the backing of the General Services Administration. The idea received support from Democrats in Congress as well, especially from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former Kennedy administration aide who had long championed completion of the Federal Triangle. There was some opposition to the idea from planning officials and others, who were dismayed at the loss of parking in the downtown area and who feared that the trade center's proposed 1,300 to 2,600 underground parking slots would not be built due to poor soil conditions. A bill was passed (almost unanimously) by Congress on August 7, 1987, to provide $362 million for the construction of an [...] "International Cultural and Trade Center" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> Federal Triangle. The plan was to provide office space for both the Justice and State departments. The legislation also provided that although the U.S. government would finance the building, a private developer would construct it. The federal government would lease space from the private developer for 30 years, after which ownership of the building would revert to the government. The bill also required the building to be financially self-supporting within two years of its completion. The rental prices throughout the lease's term would remain stable. It was only the fifth time the government had signed a [...] "lease-to-own" [...] agreement. With 1.4 million square feet (130,200 square metres) of office space and 500,000 square feet (46,500 square metres) of space for trade center activities, the planned trade center would be larger than any other federally owned building except for The Pentagon. The bill also required that the trade center be [...] "designed in harmony with historical and government buildings in the vicinity, ... reflect the symbolic importance and historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Nation's Capital, and ... represent the dignity and stability of the Federal Government." [...] A nine-member panel was established to approve any plans, and included the Secretaries of State, Agriculture, and Commerce; the Mayor of the District of Columbia; and five members of the public. The building was expected to be completed in 1992. President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Triangle Development Act into law on August 22, 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Residents {{did become}} angry, however, when D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray {{announced}} {{a plan in}} June 2012 to build a temporary parking lot on the ground of the Crummell School to accommodate 65 intercity passenger buses while a bus terminal near Union Station was being rebuilt. Area activists claimed {{they had not been}} consulted before the plan was announced, and they objected to the noise, exhaust fumes, and traffic that they said would plague their neighborhood. When Michael Durso, a staff member {{in the office of the}} Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, met with residents in September 2012, he was verbally assaulted by Ivy City residents. When Mayor Gray declined to reconsider the plan, the citizens sued in D.C. Superior Court. The Washington Post columnist Courtland Milloy argued that Gray's action occurred because Ward 5 council member Harry Thomas, Jr. had recently gone to prison and his successor, Kenyan McDuffie, had only been in office a few months. At trial, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Victor L. Hoskins admitted that the city did not know what environmental or health laws or regulations it had to meet to relocate the bus parking, and that the cost of the temporary parking lot had never been estimated. Durso testified that at least six sites were considered for the bus parking lot, but only the Ivy City site had the proper zoning, access, and space. D.C. Superior Court Judge Judith N. Macaluso, however, ruled on December 10 that the city had [...] "deliberately disregarded" [...] its own laws requiring local neighborhood consultation and that the city had [...] "evaded environmental screening by mischaracterizing the project" [...] on zoning and business occupancy documents. The injunction was temporary, however, and a series of court hearings occurred over the next two years as the city fought to build <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> the Crummell School. In an attempt to stop the parking lot relocation, Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh and Ward 5's Kenyan Duffie worked to secure $1.925 million ($ in [...] dollars) in the city's 2015 budget to fund a community center at the Crummell School. [...] The budget deal also included $7 million ($ in [...] dollars) to renovate the structure in 2016. The court lifted its injunction in March 2014, after it found that the city was able to justify construction of the bus parking lot at the Crummell School under city and federal health and environmental laws. On April 1, 2014, Gray was defeated in the Democratic primary by D.C. City Council member Muriel Bowser, who went on to win the general election on November 5, 2014. On July 30, 2015, Mayor Bowser announced an end to the city's attempt to put a bus parking lot at the Crummell School. Instead, the city would disperse the buses to parking lots at Buzzard Point, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and at curbside spaces around town.|$|E
