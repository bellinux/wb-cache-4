40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{volatilization}} {{decreases the}} N-nutrient value of livestock manure slurries {{and can lead}} to soil acidification and eutrophication problems. In this study the effect of three manure additives (Euro Mest-mix® (Mx), Effective Micro-organisms® (EM), and Agri-mest® (Am)) on NH 3 volatilization at three temperatures (4, 20, and 35 °C) was investigated. The manufacturers claim that Mx contains absorbing clay minerals and that applying Am and EM <b>to</b> <b>slurry</b> will reduce nitrogen losses, most likely by enhancing the biodegradation of manure slurry. Furthermore, the effect of mixing slurry on NH 3 volatilization has been investigated. Ammonia volatilization increased with increasing temperature and mixing of the slurries. However, at 35 °C mixing of manure reduced NH 3 emissions compared to non-mixing, which is related to a reduced crust resistance to gaseous transport at higher temperatures for non-mixing. Moreover, mixing introduces oxygen into the anaerobic slurry environment which will slow down microbial activity. The use of additives did not change manure characteristics (pH, dry matter, Ntotal, Nmineral, C/N, and C/Norganic) and did not result in a significant (p < 0. 05) decrease in NH 3 emissions, except that at 4 °C and no mixing a significant decrease of 34 % in NH 3 volatilization was observed, when Am and EM together, were applied <b>to</b> <b>slurry...</b>|$|E

We also investigated effects of the addition of EM-A <b>to</b> <b>slurry</b> manure on nitrogen losses from the manure and grass biomass production after application of the manure as organic fertilizer. EM® and Agri-mest® were tested in a factorial set-up so that the factors could be distinguished. Effective Organisms (EM) {{is a mixture of}} several effective, disease-depressing micro-organisms. Agri-mest contains energized minerals, which will influence biochemical processes occurring in the manure. Different EM-stocks, and EM-Active suspensions prepared by different users showed large variation in bacterial community structure and, thus, low reproducibility. Through the addition of Agri-mest to the slurry manure, loss of inorganic nitrogen from the slurry manure appeared to be reduced. Moreover, after application of such Agri-mest slurry as an organic fertilizer, nitrogen uptake by grass was reduced. Addition of EM-A had no measurable effects on the bacterial diversity and the chemical composition of the slurry manure. In a pot experiment, also no effects of EM on nitrogen uptake and grass biomass production were recorded...|$|E
