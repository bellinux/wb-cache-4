5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles.

Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical <b>texts</b> are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical <b>texts</b> of the Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical <b>texts</b> exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical <b>texts</b> include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E

The early <b>texts</b> assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.

5|$|The Book of the Dead {{developed}} from {{a tradition of}} funerary manuscripts {{dating back to the}} Egyptian Old Kingdom. The first funerary <b>texts</b> were the Pyramid <b>Texts,</b> first used in the Pyramid of King Unas of the 5th dynasty, around 2400 BCE. These <b>texts</b> were written {{on the walls of the}} burial chambers within pyramids, and were exclusively for the use of the Pharaoh (and, from the 6th dynasty, the Queen). The Pyramid <b>Texts</b> were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated, most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh. The purpose of the Pyramid <b>Texts</b> was to help the dead King take his place amongst the gods, in particular to reunite him with his divine father Ra; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky, rather than the underworld described in the Book of the Dead. Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid <b>Texts</b> ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege, and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials.|$|E
