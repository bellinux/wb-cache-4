30|$|Closely {{related to}} fixed point theory is {{coincidence}} theory. A point x ∈ M 1 is a coincidence {{of a pair}} of continuous maps f, g : M 1 → M 2 when f(x) = g(x). In the case where M 1 and M 2 are both oriented and of equal dimension, <b>the</b> Reidemeister <b>coincidence</b> number R(f, g), <b>the</b> Lefschetz <b>coincidence</b> number L(f, g) and <b>the</b> Nielsen <b>coincidence</b> number N(f, g) are defined. <b>The</b> Nielsen <b>coincidence</b> number is particularly interesting since it is, just as in the fixed point case, a strong lower bound for <b>the</b> number of <b>coincidences.</b> Unfortunately, <b>the</b> Nielsen <b>coincidence</b> number is usually at least as hard to compute as the Nielsen number in fixed point theory.|$|R
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt has argued that <b>the</b> <b>coincidence</b> of the names and Shakespeare's grief {{for the loss of}} his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and <b>the</b> <b>coincidence</b> with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) of 30 closed-eye awake subjects with a technique of analysis recently proposed to detect punctual events signaling rapid transitions between different metastable states.

25|$|When using RFLP, the {{theoretical}} {{risk of a}} coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures {{do not reflect the}} theory under which <b>the</b> <b>coincidence</b> probabilities were computed. For example, <b>the</b> <b>coincidence</b> probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in precisely the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases <b>the</b> <b>coincidence</b> risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones. Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.|$|E
