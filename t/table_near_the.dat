2500|$|The short ends as {{two police}} {{officers}} (Jason Sudeikis and Fred Armisen) are observing the crime scene. One finds the letter, left on the <b>table</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> brother's body, and begins to read. The letter is revealed to be a prediction of each shooting, in detail, and ends claiming that {{two police officers}} will come across the letter and then shoot each other after reading it. While the reading officer laughs it off, his partner turns and shoots him as the reading officer shoots him as well to overlapping [...] "Hide & Seek" [...] cues.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a variant}} of the English auction in which bids are written on a sheet of paper. At the {{predetermined}} end of the auction, the highest listed bidder wins the item. This auction is often used in charity events, with many items auctioned simultaneously and [...] "closed" [...] at a common finish time. The auction is [...] "silent" [...] in that there is no auctioneer selling individual items, the bidders writing their bids on a bidding sheet often left on a <b>table</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> item. At charity auctions, bid sheets usually have a fixed starting amount, predetermined bid increments, and a [...] "guaranteed bid" [...] amount which works the same as a [...] "buy now" [...] amount. Other variations of this type of auction may include sealed bids. The highest bidder pays the price he or she submitted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} sketches feature two men {{inside the}} brothel; a sailor and {{a medical student}} (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a memento mori, a reminder of death). A trace of their presence {{at a table in}} the center remains: the jutting edge of a <b>table</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg argues, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the [...] "trauma of the gaze" [...] (to use a phrase of Rosalind Krauss's invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.|$|E

50|$|When {{the players}} are unsure whether a {{touchdown}} has been scored, a flat object can be slid across the edge of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> ball. If the object moves the ball, a touchdown is ruled.|$|R

60|$|REGINALD [sardonically] The {{man that}} would raise {{his hand to}} a woman, save {{in the way of}} a kindness, is unworthy the name of Bridgenorth. [He sits down at the end of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> hearth].|$|R

50|$|After the match, Ciampa {{attacked}} Gargano {{and performed}} two Running Knee Smashes on Gargano, turning heel. Ciampa performed an Air Raid Crash through two <b>tables</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> announce <b>table</b> on Gargano. Medical personnel checked on Gargano as the event ended.|$|R
6000|$|Hargraves {{took his}} {{departure}} without another word.

60|$|Francis {{plunged into}} {{his work and}} forgot all about the matter.

He went over to him at once.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CLANDON (as {{they all}} {{assemble}} about the table). I {{think you have}} all met one another already to-day. Oh, no, excuse me. (Introducing) Mr. Valentine: Mr. McComas.

60|$|Everybody becomes silent, solemn, concerned, sympathetic. Broadbent enters, roiled and disordered {{as to his}} {{motoring}} coat: immensely {{important and}} serious as to himself.
