5|$|The use of {{scientific}} themes mark the play's position {{at a major}} turning-point in Verne's ideology. In Verne's earlier works, knowledgeable heroes aim to use their skills <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for the better; in his later novels, by contrast, scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects. The play, by exploring science in {{both positive and negative}} lights, shows Verne in transition between the two points of view.|$|E
5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an Ark {{in preparation for a}} flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will have <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the ark with his sons, who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them.|$|E
5|$|Arhys informs Daryus that Gabriel {{will be at}} Heaven's Cove {{that night}} ("Moment of Betrayal"). While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E

25|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, and the fates of non-player {{characters}} Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or allow her to die, {{depending on whether the}} player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the Little Sisters he will breathe his last breath in Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the Little Sisters <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for the better, dropping the doll that one of the little sisters give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the Little Sisters then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the little sisters gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death and make her own way in life.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the issues of <b>the</b> influence of <b>world</b> economy on <b>the</b> development of regional processes. The nature of the dependence of the modern domestic economy on the trends of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> raw material markets is considered. The heterogeneity of the regional processes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> environment indicators is revealed. The channels {{of the influence of}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> market trends <b>changes</b> on <b>the</b> regional processes are investigated. The analysis of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> economy indicators has allowed to create a system of basic indicators whose <b>change</b> reflects <b>the</b> tendencies of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> economy. <b>The</b> offered methodological approach to the assessment of the reaction of the regional processes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> market trends is based on the economic cycle concept. The methodological tools include the maps of the time shifts allowing to define the time lag of the retardation of the reaction of certain regional processes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in <b>world</b> economy; <b>the</b> model of the evaluation of the influence of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> economy indicators on the regional process, based on the correlation analysis; the differential matrix of the reactions of regional processes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in <b>world</b> market trends, which enables to group them according to the reaction speed and its value.

When God reappears once again during the hike, Evan is initially disappointed as he realizes he should never have needed to build the ark since the flood had only happened due to the ill-fated dam. However, God reassures Evan that he now has a perfect life as well as everything that he had originally prayed for and that this would not have happened otherwise in the future.
