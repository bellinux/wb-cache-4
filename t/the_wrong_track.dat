He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E

2500|$|The ATC {{system was}} plagued by {{numerous}} glitches when first implemented, initially causing significantly more harm than good. Common occurrences included sending trains down <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>tracks,</b> and, more often, inappropriately applying emergency braking. Eventually {{the result was a}} spectacular service crisis, widely referred to as the [...] "Muni meltdown", in the summer of 1998. During this period, two reporters for the San Francisco Chronicle—one riding in the Muni Metro tunnel and one on foot on the surface—held a race through downtown, with the walking reporter emerging the winner.|$|R
50|$|Zachs {{discovers that}} they are on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>tracks</b> and on a {{collision}} course with a Southern Pacific freight train hauling gasoline tank cars. Since the trains are in dark territory, it was impossible for the train dispatchers to communicate with the trains' engineers to stop the trains to avoid collision. Casey kills the mercenaries one by one and releases the hostages, but Dane uses his computer skills to locate the stealth bombers and re-targets Grazer to knock them out before they can complete their mission. Meanwhile, Penn had previously captured Sarah and uses her as bait for Casey. Casey confronts Penn and breaks his neck after a fight that spills into the kitchen.|$|R
25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b> They lost because they had to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.|$|E

Wolfe and George L. Usher intended {{to pick up the}} El Paso and Southwestern Railroad west of Douglas, Arizona, and follow it to Nogales. Visibility was poor and the compass did not work properly. Sighting a railroad, Wolfe and Usher followed it for some time until it ended. Lost and having engine trouble, they landed and were taken into custody by Mexican officials. The tracks they had steered by ran due south instead of west, and had led them to Nacozari, Sonora, seventy-five or eighty miles below the border. Though treated well, Wolfe and Usher were not set free until 2 February. They waited three more days for release of their airplane, shipping it to Douglas by train.|$|R

40|$|The article {{looks into}} the {{emergence}} and the developments of a new approach in research that {{is interested in the}} sequences, continuities and discontinuities in the landscapes of attentiveness in public communication. This interest in research stems from the old problem of explanations for the discontinuing social changes in modern society, marked by disaster and upheaval. At the University of Zurich this has fallen within the responsibility of the research department Public and Society since 1997 (FÖG – Forschungsbereich Öffentlichkeit und Gesellschaft). The realization of the beginnings and conclusions sheds a light on the contingencies, as well as on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>tracks</b> and self-convincing mechanisms inherent in any research. In addition, this retrospective serves to recall the benefit of the capture of ever changing landscapes of attentiveness in and after 2008. Finally, there is also a benefit in the sociology of knowledge: research depends on context in which the fragile tissue of ideas and attempts is woven. This is ignored by academic culture, which focuses on the creative author. Initially, we see that new approaches in research start irritation. Irritation is the mother of all knowledge and has the remarkable quality of stimulating exchange between researchers of different disciplines. Naturally, this at first increases irritation. Then, irritation enforces rereading of the classics and leads to a meandering path from which – in time – the contours of a new approach in research become visible on the horizon. Only then does work with the methodical tools of the trade on these contours begin and, maybe, constitute an approach in research that proves valid. In any case, it will give birth to new problems and irritations. Accordingly, this realization leads to the issue of the adequacy of the new approach in research with regard to the old and newly found questions concerning the causes and consequences of the latest dramatic structural change of the public and of the changes in quality in media-based communication...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the COMPASS {{experiment}} at CERN is {{the determination of the}} gluon polarisation in the nucleon, ∆G/G. It is determined from spin asymmetries in the scattering of 160 GeV/c polarised muons on a polarised LiD target. The gluon polarisation is accessed by the selection of photon-gluon fusion (PGF) events. The PGF-process can be tagged through hadrons with high transverse momenta or through charmed hadrons in the final state. The advantage of the open charm channel is that, in leading order, the PGF-process is the only process for charm production, thus no physical background contributes to the selected data sample. This thesis presents a measurement of the gluon polarisation 〈∆g/g 〉 from the COMPASS data taken in the years 2002 - 2004. In the analysis, charm production is tagged through a reconstructed D 0 -meson decaying in D 0 → K − π + (and charge conjugates). The reconstruction is done on a combinatorial basis. <b>The</b> background of <b>wrong</b> <b>track</b> pairs is reduced using kinematic cuts to the reconstructed D 0 -candidate and the information on particle identification from the Ring Imaging Cerenkov counter.

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of complex events {{shows that the}} performance of crew members and/or air traffic controllers, {{as well as the}} aircraft and its systems, may vary within different time frames. Thus, the understanding of the current situation can differ significantly within the crew and between the cockpit and the ground, as well as be at odds with the aircraft's real position and attitude over time. Further, these components interact throughout the flight. This paper presents a proposal for how better to model these complex interdependencies, using the principles of the Functional Resonance Accident Model (FRAM). The outcomes of this modelling can conveniently be shown by means of open source software, the FRAM Visualizer. Using an incident initiated where the Captain selected <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> HSI <b>track,</b> we explore the many factors that influenced the situation when the crew put the aircraft into descent but failed to intercept the localizer. This led to a crisis that they had to manage, departing significantly from Standard Procedures, and without being fully aware of their proximity to the ground when they initiated a go-around. Our aim is to develop new analytical tools in order to better characterize and understand how the flight evolved beyond acceptable safety margins, and how the crew recovered from a critical situation. Some of the factors and their comparative interactions identified in this manner may reveal inherent risks that are still present but also preventable...|$|R
