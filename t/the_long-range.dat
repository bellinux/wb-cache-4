5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of both the TSR-2 and P.1154 programmes, the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the Canberra and Hunter in <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> strike, close air support and reconnaissance roles. This resulted in the procurement of two aircraft, the General Dynamics F-111K, intended for <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> interdiction roles {{carried out by the}} Canberra, and the F-4M Phantom, which would be used in the close air support role undertaken by the Hunter. The F-111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered, but the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy; the final 32 units of the RAF order were eventually cancelled. The RAF Phantom, given the designation FGR.2, was broadly similar to the naval version, with some minor variations in terms of engines, avionics and structure, which related to its use as a land-based, rather than carrier-based aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The {{correlations}} in dusty plasmas in {{the gaseous}} state is considered. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>long-ranged</b> correlations of dust particles, contrary to usual matter, start {{to form in}} a weakly correlated state, leading finally {{to the formation of}} dust crystals and dust liquids with not strong but intermediate strength correlations. The physical mechanism leading to <b>long-ranged</b> correlations is <b>the</b> dust attraction due to shadow effects of the plasma particle fluxes. An analytic theory for <b>the</b> <b>long-ranged</b> dust density correlation function is developed and the numerical results for a broad range of dust densities and plasma temperatures are presented. <b>The</b> <b>long-ranged</b> correlations induced by dust for electron densities, ion densities, and dust charges are also investigated, and the results for electron density correlations are presented in a way that permits measurement of <b>the</b> <b>long-ranged</b> correlation function in laser and radio-wave scattering experiments...|$|R

5|$|The loss of <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> {{radar station}} at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working {{and could see}} almost as far out to sea. Along the {{surrounding}} coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, {{so there was no}} hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|E

5|$|As American fighters {{took over}} <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> escorting of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) {{daylight}} bombing raids, the Griffon-engined Spitfires progressively {{took up the}} tactical air superiority role, and {{played a major role}} in intercepting V-1 flying bombs, while the Merlin-engined variants (mainly the Mk IX and the Packard-engined Mk XVI) were adapted to the fighter-bomber role. Although the later Griffon-engined marks lost some of the favourable handling characteristics of their Merlin-powered predecessors, they could still outmanoeuvre their main German foes and other, later American and British-designed fighters.|$|E
5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> {{reconnaissance}} role, the SASR typically {{operates in}} small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators {{with the task of}} infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E

5|$|North Vietnam {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in South Vietnam. With the threat of U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved anti-aircraft units into South Vietnam, and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam, forced Republic of Vietnam Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E
5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed with <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, {{which was}} {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.|$|E
5|$|Strategic Air Command {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E
40|$|Optoelectrofluidic field {{separation}} (OEFS) {{of particles}} under light -intensity gradient (LIG) is reported, where the LIG illumination on the photoconductive layer converts the short-ranged dielectrophoresis (DEP) force to <b>the</b> <b>long-ranged</b> one. <b>The</b> <b>long-ranged</b> DEP force {{can compete with}} the hydrodynamic force by alternating current electro-osmosis (ACEO) over the entire illumination area for realizing effective field separation of particles. In the OEFS system, the codirectional illumination and observation induce the levitation effect, compensating the attenuation of the DEP force under LIG illumination by slightly floating particles from the surface. Results of the field separation and concentration of diverse particle pairs (0. 82 – 16 μm) are well demonstrated, and conditions determining the critical radius and effective particle manipulation are discussed. The OEFS with codirectional LIG strategy could be a promising particle manipulation method in many applications where a rapid manipulation of biological cells and particles over the entire working area are of interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrostatic}} interaction in ionic fluids is well-known to {{give rise to}} a characteristic phase behavior and structure. Sometimes its long range is proposed to single out the electrostatic potential over other interactions with shorter ranges. Here the importance of the range for the phase behavior and the structure of ionic fluids is investigated by means of grandcanonical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice restricted primitive model (LRPM). <b>The</b> <b>long-ranged</b> {{electrostatic interaction}} is compared to various types of short-ranged potentials obtained by sharp and/or smooth cut-off schemes. Sharply cut off electrostatic potentials are found to lead to a strong dependence of the phase behavior and the structure on the cut-off radius. However, when combined with a suitable additional smooth cut-off, the short-ranged LRPM is found to exhibit quantitatively the same phase behavior and structure as <b>the</b> conventional <b>long-ranged</b> LRPM. Moreover, <b>the</b> Stillinger-Lovett perfect screening property, which is well-known to be generated by <b>the</b> <b>long-ranged</b> electrostatic potential, is also fulfilled by short-ranged LRPMs with smooth cut-offs. By showing that the characteristic phase behavior and structure of ionic fluids can also be found in systems with short-ranged potentials, one can conclude that the decisive property of the electrostatic potential in ionic fluids is not the long range but rather the valency dependence...|$|R

5|$|The Z-3 {{was to be}} a {{reconnaissance}} {{version and}} would have had additional fuel tanks, increasing its range to 6,000km (3,730mi). Production was due to take place in 1944, just as bomber production was being abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>long-range</b> variants failed to come to fruition. The He 111Z was to have been used in an invasion of Malta in 1942 and as part of an airborne assault on the Soviet cities of Astrakhan and Baku in the Caucasus in the same year. During the Battle of Stalingrad their use was cancelled due to insufficient airfield capacity. Later in 1943, He111Zs helped evacuate German equipment and personnel from the Caucasus region, and during the Allied invasion of Sicily, attempted to deliver reinforcements to the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} mild, temperate marine climate, {{allows for}} outdoor recreation year round, including walking, hiking, cycling and outdoor team sports. Mountain biking is usually restricted to marked routes.

Recreational and transportational pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, radiate from the city centre to the countryside, providing safety from motorised vehicles and a more tranquil experience. This includes the 30 kilometre long pathway of Brabrandstien, encircling the Brabrand Lake. <b>The</b> <b>long-range</b> hiking route Aarhus-Silkeborg, starts off from Brabrandstien.|$|E
5|$|When Airbus {{designed}} the Airbus A300 {{during the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B {{in support of this}} long-term goal. Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into <b>the</b> <b>long-range</b> Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E

5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. <b>The</b> <b>long-range</b> Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they could keep tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{satellite}} communications had started to take an increasing share of the station's business, and a programme of severe rationalisation began, leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar. In the radio station's penultimate year to March 1999, there were on average, per month, 571 radio telegrams, 533 radio telephone calls and 4,001 radio telex calls. In 1998, British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio. <b>The</b> <b>long-range</b> services (HF bands 3–30MHz) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999.

The station closed in April 2000. The Highbridge station has been demolished. Sedgemoor District Council adopted a local development plan in September 2004 that included the site of the receiving station for future housing development.
