40|$|In {{the process}} {{laboratory}} of Metso minerals (Sala) AB, continuous tests {{have been made}} with a laboratory unit High-Rate <b>thickener.</b> The tests are made in order to compare three methods of thickening techniques of suspended solids. The three techniques are High-Rate thickening, conventional thickening and lamella thickening. The High-Rate and the conventional trials {{are based on a}} continuous method, while the lamella <b>thickener</b> is based on batch trials. Because the lamella <b>thickener</b> is based on batch trials and there were some optimization problems with the adding point of the flocculant at the continuous trials, it was not feasible to compare the lamella <b>thickener</b> with the other two <b>thickener</b> types. On the other hand, since the optimization problems were the same for the other two methods there was no problem comparing them. The result of the comparison between the High-Rate <b>thickener</b> and the conventional <b>thickener,</b> was, that the High-Rate <b>thickener</b> manages to work at a higher rise rate with a lower consumption of flocculant than the conventional <b>thickener.</b> Seeing to the unit area that is needed by each <b>thickener</b> it is apparent that the conventional <b>thickener</b> demands a higher unit area than the High-Rate <b>thickener</b> to achieve the same amount of solids in the underflow. It has also been showed that the High-Rate <b>thickener</b> demands a lesser quantity of flocculant at the same amount of suspended solids in the feed than the conventional <b>thickener...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the parameters influencing the grease film thickness in a rolling elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact under fully flooded conditions at medium speeds. Film thickness measurements were taken under pure rolling for six commercial greases and their bled oils. The grease film thickness was found to be higher than corresponding bled oil, suggesting the presence of <b>thickener</b> in the contact. No rheological properties (characterized by steady and dynamic shear) showed any direct relation to the film thickness of the studied greases. AFM measurements of the <b>thickener</b> microstructure, from which the dimensional properties of the <b>thickener</b> particles (fibers/platelets/spheres) were estimated, showed that the relative increase in the film thickness due to entrainment of the <b>thickener</b> was proportional to the ratio of <b>thickener</b> volume fraction {{to the size of the}} fibers/platelets/spheres. Hence, with the same concentration, smaller <b>thickener</b> particles lead to the generation of thicker films than larger <b>thickener</b> particles. Next, this relation was used to establish the percentage of the <b>thickener</b> particles passing through the contact. Depending on the grease type, between about 1 and 70 % of the <b>thickener</b> particles were found to travel through the contact...|$|R
40|$|Associative {{polyurethane}} (PU) <b>thickener</b> {{has been}} synthesized by preparing the prepolymer with {{the reaction of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), which then end-capping with long-chain alkanol. The synthesis process, as well as hydrophilic chain length, theoretical molecular weight, solvent ratio, and <b>thickener</b> percentages, has been researched. The results shows that it reaches the upmost thickening effect when the theoretical molecular weight is under 20000, soft-segment length is under 4000, solvent ratio is 1 [*]:[*] 1, and <b>thickener</b> percentages are controlled at 10 %. Furthermore, thickening mechanism of PU <b>thickener</b> has been analyzed detailedly through the measurement of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PU <b>thickener</b> {{and analysis of the}} influence of PU <b>thickener</b> on the particle size and morphology of PU dispersions. It has been observed from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that the PU aqueous dispersions produce a certain degree of flocculation when the PU <b>thickener</b> was added, and this flocculation structure has been proved to be a thixotropic structure through the characterization of the change of particle size before and after the <b>thickener</b> is introduced into the PU aqueous dispersions. The CMC measurement results present that the thickening effect will be apparent when the concentration is controlled in a low range...|$|R

40|$|A one {{dimensional}} dewatering {{model for a}} <b>thickener</b> consistent with time-dependent densification of aggregates within a sludge suspension has been developed in this paper. The effects of different densification rate parameters and different underflow solids fluxes on the predictions of the sludge rheological properties and <b>thickener</b> performance have been explored. Pre-shearing of aggregates (which leads to the aggregates densifying to some extent before entering the <b>thickener</b> consolidating bed) must occur if a large underflow solids flux is required in a densified <b>thickener.</b> This increases the suspension gel point, and hence the solids volume fraction {{at the top of}} the bed. The solids volume fraction {{at the top of the}} bed will however be the initial undensified gel point in the case of a small underflow solids flux, where no pre-shearing of aggregates needs to occur. The effects of densification and/or pre-shearing on the sludge rheological properties and <b>thickener</b> performance have been predicted. For a densified <b>thickener,</b> an algorithm has been developed to determine the maximum permitted underflow solids flux, qmax, assuming any possible solids volume fraction at the top of the bed and the maximum underflow solids flux, qmu, constraining to the initial undensified gel point at the top of the bed. Regarding the aggregate densification rate parameter, as this parameter was increased, the sludge rheological properties evolved significantly during thickening and <b>thickener</b> performance was substantially enhanced. Moreover, the total solids residence time required to achieve the desired underflow solids volume fraction was significantly reduced both for a higher densification rate parameter and in the presence of pre-shearing in a densified <b>thickener...</b>|$|R
40|$|Quality of {{skim coat}} was {{examined}} by using both {{qualitative and quantitative}} methodologies. The industrial problems of skim coats are of two major types; mixing related and application related. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank these problems according to their relative importance. Difficult to trim, poor workability and poor mixing were having the highest ranking based on the comments given by the manufacturers, retailers and users. The effect of <b>thickener</b> percentage in the skim coat {{was found to be}} significant for difficulties in mixing. Mixing was easy up to 0. 5 % of <b>thickener</b> and the flowability was found to be the best in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of <b>thickener.</b> Increase of <b>thickener</b> percentage has increased the tendency for forming agglomerates and lumps of paste during mixing. Good workability and optimum setting could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 5 % of <b>thickener.</b> Optimum performance for trimming could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of <b>thickener.</b> The above qualitative results were verified quantitatively with the physical testing; ram extrusion, set to touch drying time test, pencil hardness test and dust weight on trimming.

2500|$|The Iberian Peninsula has {{a highly}} varied {{geography}} {{with a central}} Meseta, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and {{cut off from the}} rest of Europe by the Pyrenees. This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines. Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several Mediterranean cultures. The Phoenicians introduced the cultivation of olives and the Greeks brought the Malvasia grape, founding a wine industry that would become renowned in the Middle Ages. But it was the Roman Empire, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine. After the collapse of Roman rule, Visigothic invaders conquered most of the modern day Spain and Portugal in the 5th century. The Visigoths took on many Roman customs, like the focus on vegetables, and used Latin for official purposes. But it was the invasions of North African Muslims and the establishment of Al-Andalus that gave Iberian cuisine its unique nature. The Muslims brought with them the highly refined cuisine influenced by Arab courts in the Middle East. The center of this Arab civilization was Baghdad, at the time one of the largest cities in the world. The new rulers introduced many new customs and foodstuffs; goblets made of glass rather than metal, savory meat dishes cooked with fruit, spices and herbs like cinnamon, mastic, caraway, sesame and mint and the use of ground almonds or rice as <b>thickeners</b> and a fondness for adding tangy liquids like verjuice, tamarind and the juice of bitter oranges to produce a distinctly sweet-sour taste. The impact can clearly be seen in the multitude of Arab loanwords in Spanish; naranja [...] "orange", azúcar ("sugar"), alcachofa ("artichoke"), azafrán ("saffron") and espinaca ("spinach"), many of which eventually spread to other languages in Europe. The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which is still forms the basis for many modern European meals; soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets. It also believed that escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, could very well be of Arab-Persian origin, though this has been contested.|$|E
