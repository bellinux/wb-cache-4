5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates {{starting}} at the O2 Academy Glasgow, before ending at the Brixton Academy in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, those Dunlendings who {{surrendered}} {{were given}} amnesty by Erkenbrand {{and allowed to}} return home (much to their surprise, since Saruman had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> men of Rohan would burn all survivors alive). The Rohirrim required that all hostilities cease, and that the Dunlendings retreat behind the River Isen again and never recross while bearing arms. Before they were freed, though, the Dunlending captives were put to work in repairing the fortress.|$|E

25|$|Narbona {{held back}} his forces, who were hidden {{on both sides}} of <b>the</b> defile. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> time was right, and not before, they would cut the long file of men into small pieces, like cutting a long tree trunk into firewood.|$|R

His young brother and sister were home, and Satish <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girl was the {{daughter}} of a contractor. Next morning he brought the girl to a vacant factory, tried to strangle her and ran away (this was Somani, who survived and led the police to him).|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} had {{been aware of}} the coup planning, but Cable 243 from the United States Department of State to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., stated that it was US policy not to try to stop it. Lucien Conein, the Central Intelligence Agency’s liaison between the US embassy and the coup planners, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US would not intervene to stop it. Conein also provided funds to the coup leaders.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, {{when the}} truce {{deadline}} had ended, another band of Comanches appeared again to bargain for a captive exchange. They had only threecaptives with them, including Webster's son Booker, a five-year-old girl, and a Mexican boy. Booker <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other captives had been tortured and killed when the Comanche woman {{had returned to}} camp with news of the Council House Fight. These three captives were returned after their adoptive families agreed to give them up.|$|E

He {{said one of the}} men resembled Dave very much, and smiled broadly when told the man was the lad's father. When Granbury Lapham added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two had not met since Dave was a little fellow, the sheep raiser opened his eyes wide in astonishment.|$|R
25|$|A folktale from Tlaxcala {{tells how}} some hunters saw an {{enormous}} black dog {{one night and}} decided to capture and keep it. It fled at their approach, so one hunter shot at it, wounding it in one leg. Following the blood trail {{they came to a}} richly furnished peasant hut, whose owner was tending a wound in his leg. They gave up the chase and headed for the nearest village, where the locals <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peasant had been a nahual who could transform into a dog to steal riches.|$|E
25|$|At the 20th Royal Canadian Legion Convention in Winnipeg on May 17, 1964, Pearson {{faced an}} unsympathetic {{audience}} of Canadian Legionnaires and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{time had come}} to replace the red ensign with a distinctive maple leaf flag. The Royal Canadian Legion and the Canadian Corps Association {{wanted to make sure that}} the new flag would include the Union Flag as a sign of Canadian ties to the United Kingdom and to other Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, that use the Union Flag in the quarter of their national flag.|$|E
25|$|In March she {{attended}} meetings in Elberfeld, Barmen, Wiesbaden, and then Darmstadt, where a large mixed meeting including {{women and girls}} was organized in the gymnasium. The audience had been told of the subject in advance, and listened quietly other than a few male hecklers at the front. She <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> morality police were a source of difficulty for a young fallen woman who wanted to return to an honest life. At this, the police commissioner and his agents went {{up to her and}} demanded that she stop her speech, since it was immoral.|$|E

Once it came into my head I would ax her to marry me--for she was a widow by that time--an' so make the deception true.

25|$|During the retreat, Haussegger was {{captured}} {{along with a}} number of his soldiers near the lower fords. According to a second account, on 1 January he insisted on marching his battalion into Princeton. Major Weltner argued strongly against this, and when the colonel and 10 men continued into the town, they were made prisoners. While he was in New York City, other prisoners including Ethan Allen and Alexander Graydon reported that Haussegger <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American cause was finished. He suggested to the others that they ought to ask forgiveness and make peace with the British. Haussegger bragged that he dined with Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2016, Obama {{ordered the}} U.S. Intelligence Community to {{investigate}} Russian {{interference in the}} election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017. U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that an unnamed senior administration official <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> White House was confident Russia interfered in the election. The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia.|$|E
25|$|Local {{fishermen}} {{complained to}} municipal authorities that Hotelito Desconocido's construction was illegal and that Murzilli's plans were not legally approved. However, municipal officials reportedly <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investment {{brought by the}} construction was big for Tomatlán. The group decided to establish a working relationship with Hotelito Desconocido; they allowed the construction to continue because they believed that Hotelito Desconocido would bring new jobs to Tomatlán. The hotel ownership was eventually passed down to another Italian national, Giuliano Gasparotto. The group of fishermen stated that once Gasparotto {{was in charge of}} Hotelito Desconocido, he ignored the previous concessions and stopped compensating fishermen MXN$10,000 for every day they could not fish in the sea.|$|E

25|$|On 17 August Bouchard {{arrived at}} Kealakekua Bay {{on the western}} coast of the island of Hawaii. A group of natives came close to the ship in a canoe and {{informed}} <b>them,</b> in English, <b>that</b> a corvette, {{which used to be}} Spanish but had been sold to King Kamehameha I, was also at anchor in the harbor. They also <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that,</b> on <b>the</b> previous night, a frigate had departed.|$|R
25|$|In {{outlining}} {{the case for}} colleagues hours after {{the discovery of the}} body, Perugia Reparto volanti (Flying Squad) Detective Superintendent Monica Napoleoni <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> murderer was definitely not a burglar and that apparent signs of a break-in were staged as a deliberate deception. Knox was the only occupant of the house who had been nearby {{on the night of the}} murder; she said she had spent the night of 1November with Sollecito at his flat. Over the next four days, Knox was repeatedly interviewed without being given access to a lawyer. She later testified that she was subjected to pressure tactics and struck by police to make her incriminate herself. She was arrested and charged with murder at noon on 6November 2007.|$|E
25|$|From {{the moment}} the Crusaders entered Asia Minor, things began to go badly. The king and queen were still optimistic—the Byzantine Emperor had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German King Conrad had won a great victory against a Turkish army when in fact the German army had been massacred. However, while camping near Nicea, the {{remnants}} of the German army, including a dazed and sick King Conrad, staggered past the French camp, bringing news of their disaster. The French, with what remained of the Germans, then began to march in increasingly disorganized fashion towards Antioch. They were in high spirits on Christmas Eve, when they chose to camp in a lush valley near Ephesus. Here they were ambushed by a Turkish detachment, but the French proceeded to slaughter this detachment and appropriate their camp.|$|E
25|$|During the 1964 Hama riot, Assad {{voted to}} {{suppress}} the uprising violently if needed. The decision {{to suppress the}} Hama riot led to a schism in the Military Committee between Umran and Jadid. Umran opposed force, instead wanting the Ba'ath Party to create a coalition with other pan-Arab forces. Jadid desired a strong one-party state, {{similar to those in}} the communist countries of Europe. Assad, as junior partner, kept quiet at first but eventually allied himself with Jadid. Why Assad chose to side with him has been widely discussed; he probably shared Jadid's radical ideological outlook. Having lost his footing on the Military Committee, Umran aligned himself with Aflaq and the National Command; he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Military Committee was planning to seize power in the party by ousting them. Because of Umran's defection, Rifaat al-Assad (Assad's brother) succeeded Umran as commander of a secret military force tasked with protecting Military Committee loyalists.|$|E

60|$|The {{queen and}} the princess entered as he spoke, and each gave Roger their hand; which, bowing deeply, he raised to his lips, having before <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> this was <b>the</b> salutation, among his own people, to ladies of high rank.|$|R
5000|$|The Escuela de Cristo {{was one of}} {{the best}} {{preserved}} churches and the most picturesque at <b>the</b> time, given <b>that</b> it was united with a convent that was still standing. <b>The</b> Father <b>that</b> received <b>the</b> Prince and his three companions <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.|$|R
25|$|Having {{seen the}} armed blacks, {{some of the}} more than 1,000 whites at the {{courthouse}} went home for their own guns. Others headed for the National Guard armory at Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to arm up. The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition. Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry had already learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he took appropriate measures to prevent this. He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to put on their uniforms and report quickly to the armory. When a group of whites arrived and began pulling at the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300–400 men. Bell <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter. After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{sent out}} Captain Hog with 75 men to pursue French troops who had {{threatened}} to destroy his house and property. However, shortly after Hog left, Washington called together some young Indians and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French had come to kill Tanacharison, and the Indians also left to pursue the French. That evening, Washington received a message from Tanacharison, {{who said he had}} found the French encampment. Washington decided to attack himself and brought 40 soldiers with him towards Tanacharison's camp. That morning, they met with Tanacharison's 12 Indian warriors, and Washington and Tanacharison agreed to attack the encampment. Washington ambushed the French, killing 10 to 12, wounding 2 and capturing 21. Among the dead was Jumonville; the exact manner of his death is uncertain, but by several accounts Tanacharison executed Jumonville in cold blood, crushing his head with a tomahawk and washing his hands in Jumonville's brains. One account, reported by an Indian to Contrecœur, claimed that Jumonville was killed by Half King while the summons was being read.|$|E
25|$|Hitler, however, had no {{intention}} of staying on the defensive in the west over the winter. As early as mid-September he was planning a counter-offensive. By October, with the front stabilising, he had decided on an attack in the Ardennes, designed to split the British and American fronts at a weakly held point, cross the Meuse and recapture Antwerp. On 27 October Rundstedt and Model met with General Alfred Jodl, chief of operations at OKW, and told him flatly that they considered this impossible with the available forces. Instead they suggested a more modest operation to destroy the Allied concentrations around Liège and Aachen. Jodl took their views back to Hitler, but on 3 November he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Führer's mind was made up, and that he wanted the attack to begin before the end of November. The spearhead was to be the 6th Panzer Army, commanded by Sepp Dietrich and largely made up of Waffen-SS units such as the Leibstandarte, Das Reich and Hitlerjugend, and the 5th Panzer Army, commanded by General Hasso von Manteuffel.|$|E
