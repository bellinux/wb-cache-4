The authors have created classification of the <b>trade</b> <b>services</b> technological process risks and have carried out {{a survey of the}} most important risk factors in the stages of the <b>trade</b> <b>services</b> technological process.

Risks have been arranged by their size of possible losses. The experts’ method for economic risks assessment has been used and a model of enterprises’ risks identification, classification and assessment for the <b>trade</b> <b>services</b> sector of Latvia has been made. The authors have used their own created model of enterprises’ risks identification, classification and assessment to research economic and financial risks by their effect on Latvian <b>trade</b> <b>services</b> sector enterprises’ development.

40|$|In Wide Area Networks, {{tools for}} {{discovering}} objects {{that provide a}} given service, and for choosing one out of many are essential. The CORBA <b>trading</b> <b>service</b> {{is one of these}} tools. A trader federation extends the limit of a discovery, thanks to the cooperation of several trading servers. However, in a federation, cooperation links are manually and statically established. In this article, we propose an Extended <b>Trading</b> <b>Service,</b> which manages a trader federation dynamically. With Extended <b>Trading</b> <b>Service,</b> optimized links between traders are automatically set up thanks to the use of a minimum-weight spanning tree. Cycles in discovery propagation are eliminated. Links evolve dynamically in order to adapt to the modification of the underlying topology and the failure of an intermediate trader or link. The Extended <b>Trading</b> <b>Service</b> is able to organize discovered objects from the nearest to the furthest according to a distance function chosen for the federation. Such management is provided by specialized trading servers conforming to OMG <b>Trading</b> <b>Service</b> Specification. 1...|$|R

A computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} {{used to compare the}} economic impact of subsidies between professional and technical ser-vices, high-technology manufacturing and <b>traded</b> <b>services.</b> The results suggest that the largest increase in aggregate real income is a factor tax deduction on capital to high-technology manufacturing. A factor tax deduction for the purchase of labor within professional and technical services industries increases aggregate real income in comparison to the same subsidy awarded to high-technology manufacturing or traded ser-vices. However, subsidies to either high-technology manufacturing or <b>traded</b> <b>services</b> result in increased income inequality. Only a subsidy to <b>traded</b> <b>services</b> decreases income inequality...|$|R
