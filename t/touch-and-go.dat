5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the <b>touch-and-go</b> on Runway 23 {{at the end of}} the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed to go around because a KC-135 aircraft had just landed and was on the runway. Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) above ground level (AGL), Holland radioed the control tower and asked for permission to execute a 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a <b>touch-and-go,</b> the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits of laughter.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' <b>touch-and-go</b> landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
50|$|Some flight {{instructors}} believe <b>touch-and-gos</b> {{should not}} be heavily used, if at all, with student pilots. They argue that this procedure results in less attention to learning to land properly, and thus creates safety problems. They note that neither the Federal Aviation Administration's Practical Test Standards nor its Airplane Flying Handbook discusses <b>touch-and-gos.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instructors {{who favor}} {{the use of}} <b>touch-and-gos</b> contend that it makes it {{possible}} to practice more landings per hour of instruction. Students doing <b>touch-and-gos</b> find it easier to master landing, particularly the final stage known as landing flare, which is often difficult to learn. Preparing to take off while landing is a necessary safety skill, they add, because any pilot must {{be able to do it}} in order to reject a landing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Touch-and-go's</b> are {{not allowed}} (strictly enforced) due to noise {{abatement}} restrictions to protect the birds nesting in the wildlife preserve next to the airport.|$|R
25|$|Operational Limitations – <b>Touch-and-go,</b> stop-and-go, and low {{approaches}} are prohibited on weekends, holidays, and weekdays from one half-hour after sunset until 7am the following day.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May 2002, Douglas DC-3A XB-JBR of Aero JBR ditched in Lake Casa Blanca, Texas after {{a double}} engine failure while {{performing}} a <b>touch-and-go</b> at Laredo International Airport.

25|$|Denver {{was killed}} on October 12, 1997 when his {{experimental}} Long-EZ plane, aircraft registration number N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of <b>touch-and-go</b> landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) accident ID is LAX98FA008. Denver was the only occupant of the aircraft. Identification was not possible using dental records; only his fingerprints confirmed that the pilot was Denver.|$|E

40|$|Aviation is {{the theme}} of this newsletter. My {{interest}} in aviation began with my late father who was a private pilot. He took me for rides in Mooneys and Cessnas over the deserts of Arizona. I also remember going with him to watch T- 38 s do <b>touch-and-goes</b> at the former Williams Air Force Base in Mesa, Arizona. In a bygone era, we watched skywriters using smoke particles to advertise for a local car dealership.

50|$|After the MOL program cancellation, Taylor {{continued}} his USAF {{career as an}} instructor at the Test Pilot School and served as deputy commandant. On September 4, 1970, he and French air force exchange test pilot trainee, Pierre J. du Bucq, were killed when their T-38 aircraft crashed during a training mission at Palmdale Regional Airport. The crash was caused by severe wake turbulence from a C-141 that was performing <b>touch-and-goes</b> on an intersecting runway. In memory of Taylor, the Test Pilot School presented the James M. Taylor Award to the outstanding graduate of the Experimental Test Pilot Course (Phase 1). The award was discontinued after class 71B when the school's curriculum was revised to eliminate the Phase I and II designation.|$|R
25|$|During its inter-fleet transfer, {{the carrier}} Reagan and its {{embarked}} CVW-11 aircraft participated on several bilateral and multilateral naval exercises. On 17 June 2004, two Super Étendard jet fighters and three S-2T Turbo Trackers antisubmarine aircraft from the Argentine Navy carried out <b>touch-and-go</b> landings on the Reagans flight deck during Gringo-Gaucho exercises (pictured). The Reagan Carrier Strike Group {{also participated in}} a SIFOREX (Silent Forces) exercise with the Peruvian Navy prior to its port visit to Callao, Peru, on 9 July 2004.|$|E
25|$|In July 1983, C-5A 68-0216 landed gear up at Travis Air Force Base, California. There were no injuries. The {{accident}} occurred {{while the}} crew was performing <b>touch-and-go</b> landings, and did not lower the landing gear during the final approach of the day. The aircraft received significant damage to the lower fuselage and main landing gear pods. The C-5A was later flown to Marietta for repairs. While there, the aircraft was selected {{to be the first}} C-5A converted to the C-5C configuration.|$|E
25|$|Minas Gerais {{underwent}} a modernisation refit from July 1991 to October 1993. This included the {{overhaul of the}} boilers and engines, integration of a SICONTA command system, two new navigation radars and Scanter-MIL landing radar were installed, and preparation for the installation of Simbad launchers for Mistral surface-to-air missiles. The launchers themselves were installed in 1994, with the ten Bofors removed at the same time. The Bofors could be reinstalled to complement the ship's armament if needed. In November 1993, the carrier conducted a joint exercise with the Argentine Navy, where Argentine pilots flying Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard aircraft performed 177 <b>touch-and-go</b> landings, {{in order to maintain}} their carrier landing qualifications while Veinticinco de Mayo was out of service.|$|E
5000|$|Slope {{aerobatics}} involves flying aerobatic {{figures and}} sequences {{on the slope}} with gliders that have been optimized for aerobatic flight. These gliders typically using airfoils that allow identical upright and inverted performance, as well as unique fuselage shapes that permit some amount of sustained knife edge flight. Most gliders feature three axes of control (aileron, elevator, and rudder), and often use flaperons to extend {{the capabilities of the}} airfoils for maximum aerobatic performance. Some of the most advanced slope aerobatics gliders feature all-moving elevators and rudders capable of 180* rotation, allowing them to perform [...] "flips" [...] around the pitch or yaw axis, respectively. Airframes are constructed of any material, with wood, fiberglass and/or carbon fiber being preferred for gliders intended for precision aerobatics, and EPP (expanded polypropylene) being popular for low altitude aerobatics where interactions with the ground - like wingtip and/or inverted fin drags, or <b>touch-and-goes</b> off of obstacles - are commonly performed and desired.|$|R
50|$|Solo {{military}} jet demos, {{also known}} as tactical demo, feature one aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern aircraft used in combat operations. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft's very short (and often very loud) rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, {{as well as their}} ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include aileron rolls, barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and <b>touch-and-gos.</b> Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with Thrust vectoring may be used to perform Pugachev's Cobra or the Kulbit, among other difficult manoeuvers that cannot be performed by other aircraft. Similarly, an F-22 pilot may hover his jet in the air with the nose pointed straight up, a Harrier or Osprey pilot may perform a vertical landing or vertical takeoff, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Wasp {{served as}} carrier {{qualification}} duty ship for the Naval Air Training Command from 24 January to 26 February 1967 and conducted {{operations in the}} Gulf of Mexico and off {{the east coast of}} Florida. Noteworthy during this period was the celebration of her 58,000th carrier landing on 10 February 1967 as Ensign Donald Koch carrier qualified with 2 <b>touch-and-go's</b> and 6 arrested landings in a T-28C. She called at New Orleans for Mardi Gras 4-8 February, at Pensacola on 11 and 12 February, and at Mayport, Florida, on 19 and 20 February. Returning to Boston a week later, she remained in port until 19 March when she sailed for [...] "Springboard" [...] operations in the Caribbean. On 24 March, Wasp joined [...] for an underway replenishment but suffered damage during a collision with the oiler. After making repairs at Roosevelt Roads, she returned to operations on 29 March and visited Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, and participated in the celebration from 30 March to 2 April which marked the 50th anniversary of the purchase of the Virgin Islands by the United States from Denmark. Wasp returned to Boston on 7 April, remained in port four days, then sailed to Earle, New Jersey, to off-load ammunition prior to overhaul. She visited New York for three days then returned to the Boston Naval Shipyard and began an overhaul on 21 April 1967 which was not completed until early 1968.|$|R
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test flying his Sikorsky S-43 {{amphibian}} aircraft, practicing <b>touch-and-go</b> landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules. The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night. On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash {{on the top of}} his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board. Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it.|$|E
500|$|The mission {{plan for}} the flight called for a {{demanding}} series of low-altitude passes, 60° banked turns, a steep climb, and a <b>touch-and-go</b> landing on Fairchild's runway 23. The flight was also Wolff's [...] "fini flight"a common tradition in which a retiring USAF aircrew member is met shortly after landing {{on his or her}} final flight at the airfield by relatives, friends and coworkers, and doused with water. Thus, Wolff's wife and many of his close friends were at the airfield to watch the flight and participate in the post-flight ceremony. McGeehan's wife and two youngest sons watched the flight from the backyard of McGeehan's living quarters, located nearby.|$|E

500|$|On February 20, 1970, the 4,000-foot (1,200 m) runway at NALF Ford Island {{was opened}} to {{civilian}} flight training operations, primarily local Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps flying clubs. Itinerant military helicopter training activities also continued at NALF Ford Island during this period. [...] Hawaii (which achieved statehood in 1959) contracted with the US Navy to allow <b>touch-and-go</b> landings until 1972, when the airfield was opened to students making their first solo flights. The island's {{use as a}} training center helped relieve congestion at nearby Honolulu International Airport. After its active-duty commission on February 1, 1973 the Third Fleet moved its headquarters to Ford Island, where it remained until its 1991 move to San Diego. The island remained home to Navy officers and several naval headquarters.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, the Royal Navy {{withdrew from}} the P.1154 project, and moved to procure a new fleet air defence interceptor. It {{eventually}} selected the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, then in service with the US Navy as its primary air defence aircraft, intended to be operated from both existing and planned aircraft carriers. This better suited the Royal Navy, as the Phantom had two engines (providing redundancy {{in the event of}} an engine failure), was cheaper than the P.1154, and was immediately available. The P.1154 was thus left as a wholly RAF project. Later the same year, a general election brought the Labour Party back into power. The new government undertook a defence review, which led to the 1966 Defence White Paper that cancelled several projects, including both the P.1154 and TSR-2. As a consequence, the government was forced to order new aircraft to replace the Canberra and Hunter for the RAF, and eventually chose two types. To replace the Canberra in the long-range role (which was intended for TSR-2), the F-111 was selected, with plans for a redesigned variant, while the roles undertaken by the Hunter (for which P.1154 was to be procured) would be undertaken by a further purchase of F-4 Phantoms. As the Phantom had been developed primarily for fleet air defence, the Royal Navy was happy with the choice of the aircraft as its Sea Vixen replacement, given that the type had been operational in that role with the US Navy since 1961, whilst US aircraft had successfully undertaken <b>touch-and-go</b> landings on both [...] and [...] The RAF was less enthusiastic, as the Phantom was primarily designed to operate in the air defence rather than the close air support role, and had been selected as its Hunter replacement more as a way of decreasing the per-unit cost of the overall UK order.|$|E
