However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E

In 1789 Dorset planned {{what might have}} become the first international cricket tour.

But the French Revolution meant that <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to France, thereby making his tour the first international cricket tour to be cancelled for political reasons. Just as the American Civil War 80 or so years later destroyed the prospect of cricket becoming popular there, so the French Revolution destroyed any footholds the game had in France.|$|E
25|$|Niikuni {{rejected}} {{the mix of}} poetry and other fields of expression, and insisted on expressing himself only through words. However, in the 1970s, the concrete poetry movement started adding elements of visual arts, moving away from purely word-based concretism and becoming closer to visual poetry. After the sudden passing away of Niikuni, the visual and concrete poetry movements in Japan would {{come to an end}} and Niikuni's works were soon forgotten. Niikuni's works gathered some interest in the fields of design and arts, but <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> recognition as works of poetry. However, 31 years after Niikuni's death, in 2008, a retrospective exhibition was held at the National Museum of Art in Osaka, along with the publishing of a compilation of Niikuni's works, garnering the larger public's attention once again. The aesthetic of using characters as material was noted to be related to ASCII art in a fundamental way.|$|E

Mead, Brown, Kennedy and Newman were in the prime during this period, and they had the services of Lord Tennyson who captained the side from 1919–1932 as well as captaining the England team in three Tests, and the occasional aid of many other amateurs including the great C. B. Fry, who averaged an amazing 102 in seven games during 1912. In 1922, Hampshire won one of the most remarkable victories in County Championship history when, they defeated Warwickshire by 155 runs after having followed on when dismissed for just 15. They scored 521 after being invited to bat again, set Warwickshire 314 to win and bowled them out for 158. Brown, with 172, and Livsey who scored 110* at number 10, were the heroes.|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} and final arc of the manga, the story took a darker tone {{as most of the}} {{characters}} believed Kaoru was killed by Yukishiro Enishi which made Kenshin question his own way of living and escape to a village of wanderers. Watsuki did not enjoy angst in Kenshin so his friend Myōjin Yahiko took the place as the series' protagonist until Kenshin recovered. In order to make Kenshin recover, Watsuki introduced Tomoe's father, who is simply referred as [...] "Geezer", who assists him in finding an answer to atone for his sins. Once Kenshin recovered, he runs back to the city in order to save Yahiko from Enishi's former comrade, Kujiranami Hyōgo. The fight was originally planned to last longer than the one-chapter shot but due to difficulties in drawing explosions Kujinarami made with his weapons, the fight ended with Kenshin cutting Kujinarami's weapon. In this arc's climax, Watsuki kept listening to the song [...] "Hurry Go Round" [...] by late musician hide which felt it suited the relationship between Enishi as well as Kenshin but in his darker persona. The author also commented he would like to have given both Kenshin and Enishi's characters a bigger contrast. A reader also asked Watsuki whether Kenshin could defeat his rival Saitō Hajime since <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> a final duel. Watsuki responded, saying the two are equally matched but the result might depend whether or not Kenshin had something to protect. At the end of the series, Kenshin appears with short hair. Initially, Watsuki had planned to make his hair shorter before the end; however, he found this to be similar to the character Multi in To Heart. Additionally, Himura Kenji was introduced in the finale as the son of Kenshin and Kaoru; even though the character was [...] "cliché" [...] Watsuki felt that Kenji had to appear.|$|E
