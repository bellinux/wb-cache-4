She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs. She tells him {{that she did not}} need <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything,</b> because she already knew what her father would have said.|$|E
500|$|On {{the boat}} deck, as the crew began {{preparing}} the lifeboats, {{it was difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. Lawrence Beesley described the sound as [...] "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give {{some idea of the}} unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck." [...] The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Gala Gala" [...] {{was shot}} in the {{province}} of Phuket in Thailand, and the city of Bangkok. Prior to the filming of the song [...] "Jagadame", Shyam K. Naidu was busy on the set of Munna (2007) and was unable to shoot it so cinematographer K. V. Guhan, who had worked on Mahesh's Athadu (2005), was recruited instead. The film's climax sequences were shot in March 2006 at the defunct Binny Mills located in Chennai under the supervision of FEFSI Vijayan. He suggested that Jagannadh include a scene where Prakash Raj fails <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> for a while after he is hit by Mahesh during the climax sequence.|$|E

'I can, I suppose,' says Twemlow, nervously, 'offer no {{reasonable}} objection <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>anything</b> {{that you}} do me the honour to wish {{to say to me}} under those heads. But if I may, with all possible delicacy and politeness, entreat you not to range beyond them, I--I beg to do so.' ...|$|R

500|$|August Brown of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole {{gets in the}} song". Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that [...] " [...] quirky bass line and warm-keys motif are so recognizable that it's a brow-furrowing challenge <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> other than Q-Tip and Phife's original vocals {{in the space between}} the beat and the new raps." [...] Mlynar further stated that [...] "Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely — he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there." [...] Contrarily, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: [...] " [...] didn't like try to do what was already done. [...] brought other parts to the sample that you caught that I was like, 'Oh, nice!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} noted {{there were}} a history of [...] "sexy, pneumatic, hydraulic women" [...] in science fiction, and wanted to [...] "tap into that." [...] To make the cyberwoman costume, the props department {{wanted to make it}} as [...] "sexy" [...] as they can. Director James Strong wanted to make the costume look [...] "amazing," [...] but threatening and scary as well. There were discussions about which parts of Lisa would be human, and which parts would be cyborg. Made out of rubber, it was custom made to fit Chikezie as much as possible. It took an entire day for the actress to get her body cast. After the costume was completed, it would take an hour to apply each morning, and an hour to remove by lunch break. Chikezie found it difficult <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> from the helmet while shooting scenes. It was also uncomfortable for her, but the producers noted she remained stoic throughout filming.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Acton laughed. [...] "Evidently," [...] she said. [...] "I {{think we}} were both a trifle startled when we saw you. I should be sorry <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>anything</b> had gone seriously wrong, but you remind one {{of the man who}} brought the news of Flodden." ...|$|R
500|$|Ike {{indicates}} he will [...] "vomit my balls {{out through}} my mouth" [...] {{if he has}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> more about Susan Boyle, the Scottish amateur singer who gained worldwide attention {{around the time of}} the episode's airing for her performance of the song [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] from Les Misérables on the show Britain's Got Talent. The Boyle reference in particular received a great deal of media attention the week [...] "Fatbeard" [...] first aired. Cartman says that Jewish people, Mexicans, and ginger-haired people are not allowed to be pirates. The French schooner crew members are portrayed as pretentious cowards, a stereotype of the French based on the government's surrender during World War II. The schooner itself strongly resembles the French luxury yacht Le Ponant, which was seized by Somali pirates in April 2008. Cartman refers to Blackbeard, the famous English pirate from the 17th and 18th centuries, from whom the episode derives its name. Much of the décor and music in the episode is influenced by the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride and associated film franchise. Kevin wields a toy lightsaber, the Jedi weapon from the Star Wars films; this is also a reference to the sixth season episode [...] "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers", in which he dresses as an Imperial stormtrooper while the rest of the boys are in Lord of the Rings attire.|$|E
500|$|The 13th season also {{featured}} or spoofed real-life songs and bands. The episode [...] "Fishsticks", which prominently featured rapper Kanye West, includes a two-and-a-half minute song, [...] "Gay Fish", that parodies West's [...] "Heartless". [...] "Gay Fish" [...] satirizes the rapper's tendency {{to rely on}} audio processing to correct his mistakes in pitch. After [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, the full song was made available for download on South Park Studios. Several fake Jonas Brothers songs, with lyrics about the band members' physical attractiveness, were written for [...] "The Ring". Some songs also emphasize the band's belief in sexual abstinence, with lyrics like, [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and sit around and watch Netflix?" [...] The strongly erotic reactions of the young girls at their concert parody the frenzied female fan reactions the Jonas Brothers tend to elicit, even though their image projects wholesomeness and chastity. In the episode [...] "Whale Wars", Cartman plays the video game Rock Band and performs a rendition, praised by critics, of the Lady Gaga song [...] "Poker Face". [...] On March 16, 2010, Rock Band developer Harmonix released {{this version of the}} song (along with the original version) as downloadable content for the game. In [...] "W.T.F.", during an audition for the boys' professional wrestling league, one of the participants sings a Broadway-style number—parodying the song [...] "Nothing" [...] from A Chorus Line—about why {{he wants to be a}} wrestler. The episode [...] "Fatbeard" [...] received considerable press attention after Ike stated in a letter he would [...] "vomit his balls out through his mouth" [...] if he had <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> more about Susan Boyle, the Scottish amateur singer who had recently gained worldwide attention for her performance of [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] on Britain's Got Talent.|$|E
2500|$|Skeptic Michael Shermer {{claims that}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of [...] "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to false positives. Stanford University psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "implausible." [...] Rumors of backmasking in popular music have been described as auditory pareidolia. James Walker, president of Christian research group Watchman Fellowship, states that [...] "You could take a Christian hymn, and if you played it backwards long enough at different speeds, you could make that hymn say anything you want to"; Led Zeppelin publicist BP Fallon concurs, saying [...] "Play anything backwards, and you'll find something." [...] Eric Borgos of audio reversal website talkbackwards.com states that [...] "Mathematically, if you listen long enough, eventually you'll find a pattern", while Jeff Milner recounts, [...] "Most people, when I show them the site, say that they're not able <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>anything,</b> until, of course, I show them the reverse lyrics." ...|$|E
60|$|CHARLES. Now I propose, Mr. Premium, if it's {{agreeable}} to you, a post-obit on Sir Oliver's life: {{though at}} the same time the old fellow has been so liberal to me, that I give you my word, I should be very sorry <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>anything</b> had happened to him.|$|R
6000|$|Haney smiled. [...] "Did ye order him around? I niver chanced <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> ye do <b>anything</b> but ask him questions. 'Lucius, will ye do this?' 'Lucius, won't ye do that?'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to warn you {{to be more than}} ever careful." [...] It was, I confess, a pang to me, who thought only of love, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>anything</b> else should have been the {{initiative}} power of her coming, even though it had been her concern for my own safety. I could not but notice the bitter note of chagrin in my voice as I answered: ...|$|R

By the way"--his eyes darted again from my face <b>to</b> Holmes's--"did you <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> else besides a cry?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... (Arabic: إدراك - cognition) With {{continuous}} {{practice of}} meditation, the sleepiness from meditation decreases. When the conscious mind is not suppressed by sleep {{and is able}} to focus, the person can receive the spiritual knowledge from his subconscious mind. At this stage, the person is unable <b>to</b> see or <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> but is able to experience or perceive it.|$|R

5000|$|He {{attended}} Knox College {{and established}} a mediocre academic record, unable <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> almost <b>anything</b> in his classes. He did well at writing however, and in his senior year was elected editor-in-chief of the college newspaper, Coup d'État. He was then made editor of the college news published in the local paper every Thursday. He learned to master lip reading, although he said he got more from reading than from the classes. [...] He barely graduated in 1891, after the faculty failed him in Geology, but the Trustees overruled them and allowed him to graduate.|$|R
5000|$|In Sudden Walks {{was praised}} by critics worldwide. The album was also {{nominated}} for best foreign record of 2009 in the Italian Prog Awards, and the band was invited to open that year's edition of Crescendo Prog Rock Festival in Saint-Palais-sur-Mer (France). César Inca of Progarchives stated,““In Sudden Walks” {{may have been one}} of the 5 most accomplished neo-prog albums of 2009. It is a lovely collection of inventive compositions and bold arrangements” while W.A. Fisher said: [...] ""In Sudden Walks," [...] is brilliant! It is symphonic, melodic, ethnic, emotional, well performed, well-engineered and recorded, beautifully sung, and very fresh and new feeling”. Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock also gave the album a positive review stating,.“If I had to sum up In Sudden Walks in a single word, it would have to be [...] "beautiful". its perfect, pristine and inventive production that sometimes makes me think I'm listening to an Alan Parsons Project album. I hope for Aisles' sake it's just accessible enough that they can continue to make albums of this quality. I'll be looking forward <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>anything</b> these gents come up with. Truly exceptional music. Very highly recommended!”.|$|R
