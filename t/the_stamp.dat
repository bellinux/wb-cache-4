5|$|In 1765, Parliament passed <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt {{the economy of the}} British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Jeita {{became a}} {{national}} symbol when Lebanese authorities issued a stamp featuring the lower cavern to promote national tourism.

5|$|In September 1765, Adams {{was once}} again {{appointed}} by the Boston Town Meeting to write the instructions for Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author {{of a series of}} House resolutions against <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act, which were more radical than those passed by <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act Congress. Adams {{was one of the first}} colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate.|$|E

50|$|In 1962, J. D. Sumner {{became the}} manager of <b>the</b> <b>Stamps</b> Quartet, and three years later, he left the Blackwood Brothers to sing with them. Sumner was most noted {{as the leader of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stamps</b> Quartet, which became known as J.D. Sumner & <b>The</b> <b>Stamps.</b> Elvis Presley, while as a teenager, idolized Sumner's singing after seeing him perform with the Sunshine Boys. Presley hired Sumner & <b>The</b> <b>Stamps</b> as his back-up singers in 1971. The group toured and {{recorded}} with Presley from November 1971 until Presley's death in 1977. He not only sang at Elvis' funeral but had previously sung at the funeral of Elvis' mother, Gladys, in 1958.

5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. <b>The</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E

5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stamps</b> appear only in {{specialist}} catalogues. Many {{are thought}} to have been forged and some may have been produced purely for philatelic purposes and to have never seen genuine use. For these reasons, collectors prefer to collect <b>the</b> <b>stamps</b> on cover, however, such covers are rare. <b>The</b> <b>stamps</b> are classed as cinderellas or stamps for a local post.|$|R

5|$|The Colony of Western Australia {{produced}} {{its first}} postage stamps in 1854, and {{in contrast to}} the usual practice within the British Empire, they featured, not a portrait of Queen Victoria, but an image of the black swan. The design of <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> underwent several modifications over the next 48 years, until 1902, when the last design was produced, although the swan stamps continued in use until 1913, when Australian stamps superseded the colonial/state issues. The most famous of the series was the four-penny Blue Inverted Swan produced in 1855, in which the central image was printed upside down. <b>The</b> <b>stamp</b> is now an acknowledged philatelic rarity, with only fifteen known to have survived. Stamp issues in all of the other British colonies in Australasia, such as New South Wales, featured royal portraits rather than local symbols, apart from some one-off commemorative issues.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} {{postage stamps}} used in Ireland between 1840 and 1922, {{it is necessary}} to identify the postmark cancelling <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> as being from an Irish town. Stamps used during this period are referred to as Great Britain used in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{emerged as}} a leading {{political}} figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, {{he thought that the}} colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.|$|E

5|$|In the 1760s, the British Parliament's {{passage of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act and the Townshend Acts, {{combined}} with other frustrations, increased political tension and anger against England in the colonies. Philadelphia residents joined boycotts of British goods. After the Tea Act in 1773, there were threats against anyone who would store tea and any ships that brought tea up the Delaware. After the Boston Tea Party, a shipment of tea had arrived in December, on the ship the Polly. A committee told the captain to depart without unloading his cargo.|$|E
5|$|On the 150th {{anniversary of}} the Declaration of Independence in 1926 the U.S. Post Office issued a {{commemorative}} stamp depicting the Liberty Bell for the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1926, though this stamp actually depicts the replica bell erected {{at the entrance to}} the exposition grounds. The Liberty Bell was chosen for <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> design theme because the symbol was most representative of the nation's independence. Since then the Liberty Bell has also appeared on several other U.S. postage stamps, including the first forever stamp, issued since 2007.|$|E
