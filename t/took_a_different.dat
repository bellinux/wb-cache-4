5|$|Route X53 <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> route between Burnley and Rawtenstall, via Water and Waterfoot in {{the upper}} Irwell Valley. In the early 1960s these {{journeys}} were 4-hourly and started/ended at Burnley. By the 1970s frequency had declined to a southbound morning and northbound evening peak working, but it survived to be renumbered 753 when X43 became 743. It was withdrawn along with the 743.|$|E
5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders. Jack Brabham, owner and lead driver of BRO, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{approach to the}} problem of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{approach}} to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{approach}} to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{approach}} {{to the situation in}} Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E

5|$|Shaw's first box-office {{success was}} Arms and the Man (1894), a mock-Ruritanian comedy satirising {{conventions}} of love, military honour and class. The press found the play overlong, and accused Shaw of mediocrity, sneering at heroism and patriotism, heartless cleverness, and copying W.S.Gilbert's style. The public <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> view, {{and the management}} of the theatre staged extra matinée performances to meet the demand. The play ran from April to July, toured the provinces and was staged in New York. Among the cast of the London production was Florence Farr, with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894, much resented by Jenny Patterson.|$|E
5|$|True Blue is {{the third}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna, released on June 30, 1986, by Sire Records. She co-wrote and co-produced the entire album with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard. True Blue deals with her visions of love, work, dreams as well as disappointments, and was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn, to whom Madonna dedicated the album. Musically, the songs on the album <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> direction from her previous endeavours, incorporating classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.|$|E

In each episode, Veronica solves a different stand-alone case while working to solve a more complex mystery. The first two seasons of the series each had a season-long mystery arc, introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the season finale. The third season <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that would last the course of several episodes.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach to that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research {{on the structure of}} the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX was {{developed}} alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach {{by returning to}} the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. It is often cited by critics and fans {{as one of the}} best entries in the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling over five million copies worldwide by March 2003 and five and a half million copies by February 2016. In 2016 ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.|$|E

5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year. The album's production <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach to how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then {{took them to the}} studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the {{succession}} marked Louis' reign. Elizabeth was long considered barren, and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king's death. Her brother-in-law Stephen was heir presumptive {{until his death in}} 1354, when his son John replaced him. However, John also died in 1360. A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365, but the child died the next year. For a few years, John's sister, Elizabeth, was treated as heir presumptive and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated. Things suddenly <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> course after Elizabeth had three daughters in quick succession; Catherine was born in July 1370, Mary in 1371, and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374. Elizabeth is known to have written a book for the education of her daughters, a copy of which was sent to France in 1374. However, all copies have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
