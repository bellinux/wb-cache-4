5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E

Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> to the horizontal branch.|$|E

5|$|PETA {{took on the}} Pokémon {{series with}} Pokémon Black and Blue, a parody of Pokémon Black and White that focuses on animal {{fighting}} and experimentation. In role-playing-style battles, the player controls a Pikachu who escapes its Trainers, Cheren. Pikachu first fights Cheren and <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> on to other Trainers in order to rescue their Pokémon from ownership. Pikachu recruits these Pokémon to its cause, {{as well as the}} sympathetic Nurse Joy. A sequel, Pokémon Red, White, and Blue, followed in 2013. The game suggests that Nintendo's continual releases of Pokémon games reduce humans' empathy for animals. Also a role-playing game, it stars Pikachu and Miltank, who battle McDonald's characters like the Hamburglar in a crusade against the rare but ongoing practice of meat production in the Unova region.|$|E
5|$|S {{is about}} {{voyeurism}} {{as it relates}} to underground films. Interviews with horror film directors and Carol J.

In the beginning of the film, clips show the directors and Clover commenting on a horror film that is not shown onscreen and with the title not mentioned. The film <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> on to Petty's meetings with Eric Rost (Erik Marcisak), Bill Zebub, and Fred Vogel. He interviews these men and actress Debbie D., while clips from horror films and facts and opinions provided by Clover about the genre are interspersed.|$|E

Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her theory that the problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, the Serbian Parliament {{enacted a}} law {{establishing}} Vojvodina's borders. It {{referred to the}} boundary proposed by the Đilas commission explicitly noting that it was temporary. The law noted that the border follows the Danube from the Hungarian border to Ilok, crosses the Danube leaving Ilok, Šarengrad and Mohovo in Croatia <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> south and leaves the cadastral municipalities of Opatovac, Lovas, Tovarnik, Podgrađe, Apševci, Lipovac, Strošinci and Jamena in Croatia, and everything east of the line in Vojvodina. The awarding of Ilok to Croatia was {{a departure from the}} findings of Đilas commission and it was based on a referendum held in the town on the matter in 1945 or 1946, when its population voted to be added to Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

5|$|The initial six-part {{series was}} {{published}} between February and July 1993. The story follows former reporter Eddie Brock, first introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988), as a villain and {{enemy of the}} superhero Spider-Man. In his appearances in The Amazing Spider-Man, Brock blames Spider-Man for ending his career by debunking one of his stories. He bonds with the Venom symbiote, a sentient alien that had previously bonded with (and been rejected by) Spider-Man. Together, Brock and the symbiote become Venom. In The Amazing Spider-Man #375, Brock makes peace with Spider-Man after he saves Brock's wife (Ann Weying) from death. Brock <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> {{back to his home}} city of San Francisco for a fresh start, starting the events of Venom: Lethal Protector.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex <b>then</b> <b>moves</b> across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
