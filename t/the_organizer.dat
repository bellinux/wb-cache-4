5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of {{the event}} {{announced}} a match-up between Washington's Skyline High School and Oregon's Jesuit High School in 2009, {{he said that he}} proposed the possibility of televising games to Fox Sports, but Fox did not televise the game. Skyline went on to shut out Jesuit 17–0 during that year's Emerald City Classic.|$|E
5|$|Official scorers in {{the minor}} leagues are {{generally}} hired by the teams to score games at their stadium. Some minor league scorers have a history or connection with the team, including former players, former coaches, and local writers. Official scorers for international baseball competitions are generally selected by <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Puk, <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of {{the first}} massacre, was {{captured}} by British forces while attempting to flee to Austria in May 1945 and was extradited to Yugoslavia several months later, where he committed suicide by slitting his wrists with a razor blade. Luburić, <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of the second massacre, escaped Yugoslavia {{after the war and}} moved to fascist Spain, where he was assassinated by a person generally assumed to have been an agent of the Yugoslav State Security Service (UDBA). Pavelić survived the war and died in Spain in 1959. Stepinac, who failed to publicly condemn the atrocities in Glina, was accused of collaborating with the Ustaše by Yugoslavia's new Communist government and was tried in 1946, where Jednak testified against him. He was subsequently sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment and died while under house arrest in 1960. In 1986, Jednak testified against the Ustaše government's Minister of the Interior, Andrija Artuković, at his trial in Croatia.|$|E
50|$|He {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> of <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Chautauqua (1892); one of <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> of <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Dutch Society (1891); and one of <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> of <b>the</b> Lebanon County Historical Society (1898). Dr. Schmauk was President of the Board of Directors of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, (1908-20) and {{in charge}} of the Department of Ethics, Apologetics and Pedagogy, (1911-20).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>organizers</b> {{were granted}} by the City of Oakland all needed permits to host the events. It was the goal of <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> to provide a fun and safe {{atmosphere}} for its patrons.|$|R
50|$|Khristianovich {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> of <b>the</b> Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, one of <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and {{a co-founder}} of Novosibirsk State University.|$|R
5|$|Also in 2003, The Rolling Stones {{performed}} in Singapore {{as part of}} their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by <b>the</b> <b>organizer.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{exhibitions}} and performances were also permitted {{to be held}} at Speakers' Corner. The conditions that organizers and participants had to adhere to were broadly similar to those applying to speeches. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> or an authorized agent had to be present at all times during the exhibition or performance, the event could not contain violent, lewd or obscene messages, no banners or placards could be carried by participants, and the event could not be an assembly or procession for which a permit was required under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{consolidated}} {{power by}} gradually whittling away {{the rights of}} their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party – Mikołajczyk's PSL. In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were being sentenced to death on trumped up charges — among them Witold Pilecki, <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of the Auschwitz resistance, and numerous leaders of Armia Krajowa and the Council of National Unity. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially, or forced to exile. The opposition members were also persecuted by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and right-wing organizations by state security kept some partisans in the forests, {{the actions of the}} Ministry of Public Security of Poland (UB, Polish secret police), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The right-wing insurgency radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945 and faded after the amnesty of February 1947.|$|E
50|$|A week later, <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> {{issued a}} refund plan {{for people who}} were not let in. In 2013, <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> {{announced}} that to prevent a similar event from taking place, no onsite sales would take place.|$|R
50|$|Złombol is {{an extreme}} rally. Teams have no support or help from <b>the</b> <b>organizers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>organizers</b> only suggest places on camping spots for a night's rest. Each team is taking part on their own expense and risk.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the circuit}} will pass {{residential}} areas, residents {{will not be}} cut off from their homes; <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> plan {{to provide access to}} the seven affected residences. <b>The</b> <b>organizers</b> further plan to fund the race without any public money.|$|R
5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of the resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it means that he was likely imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|This fourth IARC {{mission was}} {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war threat was perceived {{to come through the}} Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.|$|E
5|$|Boyce was {{recognized}} with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, {{the first year}} it was awarded, for his efforts in starting the BSA. He was the third recipient, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. During the BSA's 50th anniversary in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and several of Boyce's descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois governor William Stratton delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, about 2,500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa, attended by his last surviving child, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member. Boyce {{had been a member}} from 1891 until he died. On December 6, 1997, a Scouting museum opened in Ottawa. The W. D. Boyce Council of the BSA is named in his honor. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, recognizes his achievements to Scouting. Not far from the marker is a county park, Boyce Park, that was named for him. A medallion of Boyce is near the White House as part of The Extra Mile– Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. In 2005, the BSA introduced the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award, presented to <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> of any new Scouting unit.|$|E

50|$|After {{the success}} of the event in 2004, <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> did not conduct an event in either 2005 or 2006.
