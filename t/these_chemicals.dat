50|$|Redox {{reactions}} in batteries with faradaic charge-transfer between an electrolyte {{and the surface}} of an electrode were characterized decades ago. <b>These</b> <b>chemical</b> processes are associated with chemical reactions of the electrode materials usually with attendant phase changes. Although <b>these</b> <b>chemical</b> processes are relatively reversible, battery charge/discharge cycles often irreversibly produce unreversed chemical reaction products of the reagents. Accordingly, the cycle-life of rechargeable batteries is usually limited. Further, the reaction products lower power density. Additionally, the chemical processes are relatively slow, extending charge/discharge times.|$|R
5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. <b>These</b> <b>chemicals</b> have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well.

50|$|Before 2000, Xiangshui is an {{agricultural}} land with uncontaminated environment {{and it still}} owns a well shaped ecosystem. However,due to the strict restriction in prosperous Southern Jiangsu province recently, many chemical plants moved to the relatively poor northern Jiangsu Province. <b>These</b> <b>chemical</b> factories usually enjoyed the preferential treatment from the local Xiangshui government.

5|$|The tansy plant {{naturally}} {{contains a}} number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The tansy beetle is resistant to <b>these</b> <b>chemicals.</b> However, tansy is a repellent to other Chrysomelid beetles. For example, the steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly repellent to the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Two novel sesquiterpenes, dictyophorine A and B, {{have been}} {{identified}} from the fruit bodies of the fungus. These compounds, based on the eudesmane skeleton (a common structure found in plant-derived flavours and fragrances), are the first eudesmane derivatives isolated from fungi and were found to promote the synthesis of nerve growth factor in astroglial cells. Related compounds isolated and identified from the fungus include three quinazoline derivatives (a class of compounds rare in nature), dictyoquinazol A, B, and C. <b>These</b> <b>chemicals</b> were shown in laboratory tests to have a protective effect on cultured mouse neurons that {{had been exposed to}} neurotoxins.

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. <b>These</b> <b>chemicals,</b> termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E

5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. <b>These</b> <b>chemicals</b> mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to <b>these</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as it gets in touch with ancient fossils.
