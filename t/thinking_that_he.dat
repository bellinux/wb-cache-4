When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing, and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.|$|E
5|$|Mullen {{is said to}} have a preternatural {{sense of}} rhythm. Brian Eno recounted that while working with Mullen on a U2 album, Mullen kept insisting that the click track was off and lagging behind the tracks that had already been recorded. Eno {{adjusted}} it, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was just humouring Mullen, but later found that Mullen was right and the click track had indeed been off by six milliseconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{financial}} {{consequences of}} the collapse of their company were mitigated be a series of three benefit performances, in coordination with the local Russian-language theater company. Sonya returned to Odessa to give birth to their daughter Rivka; Adler stayed on six weeks in Zhytomyr and had sort of a belated apprenticeship with two Russian character actors of national fame, Borisov and Philipovsky. However, he returned to Odessa <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would most likely leave theater behind.|$|E
5|$|He also attacks Wei {{in campaigns}} masterminded by Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang gains Jiang Wei {{as a general}} after {{isolating}} him and tricking Wei general Ma Zun into <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was betraying him, in a clever ploy at the Battle of Tianshui ("Tales"). He proceeds to defeat the Wei after a failed prisoner exchange at the Battle of Mt. Dingjun and saves Ma Su from defeat at the Battle of Jieting. His final battle with Wei is at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, where he fakes his death, only to ambush the Wei forces and defeat Sima Yi. If Wu has fallen before Wei, Shu will attack Xuchang, the co-capital of Wei, and take it, with Wei's officers fighting to the death.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E

5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|Histiaeus now {{gathered}} a large force of Ionians and Aeolians {{and went to}} besiege Thasos. However, he then received {{the news that the}} Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos. In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be able to talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.|$|E

5000|$|Kidman sees a {{news story}} about Stanley Kubrick on {{television}} and realizes he didn't meet with the real man. He confronts Jonny, who confesses his scheme. Seeing an opportunity to establish himself as a success, Jonny promises that a friend of his, a director named Renatus, can film a fake moon landing. Jonny takes Kidman to meet Renatus at the director's mansion, which he {{has turned into a}} commune. <b>Thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> being hired for an art project, Renatus accepts. Meanwhile, a hippie girl named Ella takes an interest in Kidman.|$|R
5|$|Homer buys {{a matter}} {{transporter}} from Professor Frink. That night, Bart, after experimentations involving the family pets, {{steps into the}} teleporter with a fly on his arm, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will become a mutant superhero. He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by the fly and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees {{this as an opportunity}} to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E
5|$|Khan's first {{starring}} role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays {{led to the}} 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1991). Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90), and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style {{with those of the}} film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E
60|$|The on'y person {{outside the}} Jolly Pilots when Ginger got {{there was a}} man; a strong-built chap with a thick neck, very large 'ands, and a nose which 'ad seen its best days some time afore. He looked 'ard at Ginger as 'e came up, and then stuck his 'ands in 'is trouser pockets and spat on the pavement. Ginger walked a little way past and then back agin, and just as <b>he</b> was <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> might venture to go off, as Miss Tucker 'adn't come, {{the door opened and}} out she came.|$|R

5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies {{and set them}} on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E
5|$|The International Commission on Atomic Weights, {{which was}} then {{responsible}} for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact}} that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German-speaking chemists called lutetium by Welsbach's name, cassiopeium; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. The reason for this was that Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium. This later misled Urbain into <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. The later discrediting of Urbain's work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of Welsbach's work on element 71, so that the element was renamed to cassiopeium in German-speaking countries for some time. Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time. Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Oku had {{absolutely}} no interest in politics, and lived in virtual seclusion after the war. When he died in 1930, many people were astonished, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had died years previously.|$|E
60|$|Now {{one evening}} {{the king of}} that country was hunting near the charcoal-burner's hut. As he passed the door, he heard a sound of sobbing, and being a good-natured man he stopped to listen, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>he</b> {{might be able to}} give some help.|$|R
60|$|With {{these words}} they both {{disappeared}} and left him. He walked on, <b>thinking</b> still <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must be dreaming. Very soon he retired {{to rest in}} a splendid room, far grander than anything he had ever dreamed of.|$|R

25|$|When believing Harry to be {{dead and}} <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has final victory in his grasp, Voldemort proclaims his {{intention}} to abolish the other three houses and force all Hogwarts students into Slytherin.

25|$|Tim Cain, the producer, lead {{programmer}} {{and one of}} {{the main}} designers of the 1997 computer game Fallout, said: This book was how individual will handle <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the last survivor on Earth. This is why in Fallout before you leave the Vault we really wanted that sense of isolationism. That sense: You are the only personality here on the Wasteland who is called a normal person and what do you feel like special in that way.|$|E
5000|$|Montesquieu, in The Spirit of Laws, was {{possibly}} {{the first to}} suggest a universal explanation for history.

6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] said Oak, in the modest tone good manners demanded, <b>thinking,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would never let}} Bathsheba see him playing the flute; in this resolve showing a {{discretion}} equal to that related to its sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva herself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't call it anything,' said Annette, {{with her}} head drooping. 'I would not have told even you, but to console you about this.
