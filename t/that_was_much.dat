5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E

On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E

5|$|The Han dynasty {{inherited}} the ban liang coin type from the Qin. In {{the beginning of}} the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager Lü Zhi (d. 180 BC), who abolished private minting. In 182 BC, Lü Zhi issued a bronze coin <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> lighter in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6g (0.09oz) in weight.|$|E
5|$|Mercyful Fate was {{originally}} formed in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1981, following {{the dissolution of}} the band Brats. Brats had been a punk/metal band, featuring future Mercyful Fate members, vocalist King Diamond, and guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner. After two studio albums and several line-up changes (including the addition of Diamond and the departure of Denner), Diamond and Shermann began writing new material <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> heavier than any of Brats' previous work. The band's record label CBS was not pleased with the material, and demanded they stop singing in English and become more commercial. As a result, Diamond and Shermann quit the group and went on to form Mercyful Fate. After several line-up changes and semi-professional demo tapes, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982. This line-up, consisting of King Diamond, Hank Shermann, bassist Timi Hansen, drummer Kim Ruzz and guitarist Michael Denner, would go on to record the group's first two studio albums.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.|$|E

25|$|Until 2002, Phrymaceae {{was usually}} defined as {{consisting}} {{of only a}} single, anomalous species, Phryma leptostachya. Whenever Phrymaceae was not recognized, Phryma was usually placed in the family Verbenaceae, but sometimes in Lamiaceae. Mimulus and its relatives were usually placed in some version of Scrophulariaceae <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> larger than the currently accepted circumscription of that family.|$|E
25|$|Ferries {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Susquehanna River at Millersburg {{since at least}} the early 19th century. The one mile (1.6km) crossing was first served by a pole ferry <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> like a bateau. The ferry predates the establishment of Millersburg in 1807. The borough's founder Daniel Miller reserved the ferry and shad fishery rights along the Susquehanna for himself.|$|E

Sobieski managed to reform the Polish army completely. The army was reorganised into regiments, the infantry finally dropped pikes, replacing them with battle-axes, and the Polish cavalry adopted hussar and dragoon formations. Sobieski also greatly increased the number of cannon and introduced new artillery tactics.|$|E
25|$|In February 1994, {{an audit}} {{committee}} headed by future political candidate Bruce Lunsford revealed TARC had been mismanaging funds {{and was on}} pace to deplete its once-large trust fund due to skyrocketting expenses such as door-to-door services for the disabled as well as rates of spending on personal services and fringe benefits for administrators <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> higher than in transit companies for similar sized cities. In the fallout of the audit, TARC's executive director resigned and fares were nearly doubled before year's end.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} {{companies}} was the Bendix Corporation, who found the Dashaveyor concept and decided {{it would make the}} basis for a competitive AGT system. Its main advantages in this role were its high speed and its ability to switch among a network of tracks. Most competing AGT systems operated at a fixed speed <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> lower than the Dashaveyor, and normally followed fixed routes. They purchased the company {{and turned it into a}} subsidiary, developing the AGT versions in Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

25|$|In 1933 the Boeing 247 was introduced, {{the first}} truly modern airliner. The 247 was an {{all-metal}} low-wing monoplane <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> faster, safer, {{and easier to}} fly than other passenger aircraft. For example, {{it was the first}} twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine. In an era of unreliable engines, this vastly improved flight safety. Boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own United Airlines subsidiary's operations. This badly hurt competing airlines, and was typical of the anti-competitive corporate behavior that the U.S. government sought to prohibit at the time.|$|E
25|$|More famously, Cruciada Românismului hosted {{articles}} by Panait Istrati. He was a literary celebrity and long-time socialist, whose public denunciation of the Soviet Union had sparked an international controversy. It {{is still unclear}} whether Istrati was ever formally affiliated with the Crusade as a political party. Some authors suggest as much. In April Istrati died from tuberculosis in Bucharest. He {{had been unable to}} support himself during his last months, and relied on government handouts—an appeasement <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> ridiculed from the far left. An independent Trotskyist newspaper, Proletarul, claimed that the Stelists had supervised Istrati's funeral ceremony, driving away his leftist friends.|$|E
25|$|The castles {{that the}} clan {{received}} in Upper Hungary were {{of great importance}} as they controlled the borders, Vah river and important roads. They were all built to give good defense against an enemy. Inside the strongholds, the clan had own army unites, their upkeep was paid from the income Ostojas gained from their land that they owned or controlled. They could also afford to hire mercenaries when necessary {{and they were in}} close cooperation with each other, often visiting and helping to maintain the power they have been given. All of them were in possession of land <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> bigger than any of the clan members had in Poland.|$|E

25|$|On October 4, 1970, {{producer}} Paul Rothchild {{became concerned}} when Joplin {{failed to show}} up at Sunset Sound Recorders for a recording session. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager John Cooke drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood where Joplin was staying. He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), he found her dead on the floor beside her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposal}} to relocate the terminal {{from the east}} side {{to the site of}} the Miramar Golf Course was put forward in 1956. Houses were moved and hills were bulldozed to make way for the construction of the new Wellington Airport in 1958, at a total cost of £5 million. The current airport was officially reopened on 25 October 1959, after lobbying by the local Chamber of Commerce for a location <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> closer to the city centre. Paraparaumu Airport was deemed unsuitable for large planes due to adverse terrain. The original length of the runway was 1630m (5350ft), and was extended to the length of 1936 m in the early 1970s, to handle DC-8s.|$|E
25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E
