5|$|Ayumi is Yuu's and Shunsuke's {{energetic}} {{younger sister}} {{in junior high}} school. She has an innocent personality and deeply cares for Yuu, providing moral support to him. Ayumi often cooks for Yuu and {{has a tendency to}} add pizza sauce to every food she makes, unaware that Yuu's modern tastes cannot handle <b>the</b> <b>sweetness.</b> She is a fan of the band How-Low-Hello and an avid admirer of Yusa. She eventually awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, but this is stolen by Yuu to prevent her death.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> of the wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having {{a higher level of}} ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sweetness</b> {{of carrots}} allows the {{vegetable}} {{to be used}} in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary reason}} that {{fructose}} is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative <b>sweetness.</b> It is <b>the</b> sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. <b>The</b> relative <b>sweetness</b> of fructose {{has been reported}} in the range of 1.2-1.8 times that of sucrose. However, it is the 6-membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar. Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form. Therefore, <b>the</b> relative <b>sweetness</b> decreases with increasing temperature. However it has been observed that <b>the</b> absolute <b>sweetness</b> of fructose is identical at 5 °C as 50 °C and thus <b>the</b> relative <b>sweetness</b> to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in <b>the</b> absolute <b>sweetness</b> of sucrose at lower temperatures.|$|R

5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> of the ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, {{in a similar manner}} to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> of the wine.|$|E
25|$|The {{scent of}} {{liquorice}} root {{comes from a}} complex and variable combination of compounds, of which anethole is up to 3% of total volatiles. Much of <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30–50 times <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> of sugar. <b>The</b> <b>sweetness</b> {{is very different from}} sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer.|$|E

25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> of the dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E

25|$|As Vouvray {{can be made}} in a {{wide range}} of {{sweetness}} styles, the wine labels may indicate <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> level by the terms Sec, Demi-Sec, Moelleux and Doux. While these terms are not strictly defined, they tend to roughly fall into the guidelines below. Note that the residual sugar level may not equate to the level of sweetness that a taster will perceive in the wine due to balance of acidity in the wine. In some cases a producer's Demi-Sec wine may taste drier than their Sec. Sparkling Vouvray may also have <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> level indicated on the label.|$|E

50|$|From these {{beginnings}} in {{the early}} 20th century, <b>the</b> theory of <b>sweetness</b> enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when Robert Shallenberger and Terry Acree proposed the AH-B theory of sweetness. Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a hydrogen bond donor (AH) and a Lewis base (B) separated by about 0.3 nanometres. According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on <b>the</b> biological <b>sweetness</b> receptor to produce <b>the</b> sensation of <b>sweetness.</b>|$|R

25|$|Dried {{sticks of}} the {{liquorice}} root {{are also a}} traditional confectionery {{in their own right}} in the Netherlands, which has quickly waned in popularity in recent decades.
