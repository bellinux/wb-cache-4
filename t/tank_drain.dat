40|$|Wastewater {{management}} {{encompasses a}} broad range of efforts that promote effective and responsible water use, treatment, and disposal and encourage the protection and restoration of our nation's watersheds. Wastewaters generated in areas without access to centralized sewer systems rely on on-site wastewater systems. These typically comprise a septic <b>tank,</b> <b>drain</b> field, and optionally an on-site treatment unit. Widely used terminology refers to three levels of wastewater treatment: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or advanced). Primary (mechanical) treatment is designed to remove gross, suspended and floating solids from raw sewage. Secondary (biological) treatment removes the dissolved organic matter that escapes primary treatment. Tertiary treatment is simply additional treatment beyond secondary. A “decentralized” wastewater treatment program is one that utilizes wastewater management solutions as close to the sources of the wastewater as possible. This is often realized by utilizing a number of on-site or shared systems to treat relatively small volumes of wastewater, generally from individual buildings or groups of buildings, at or near the source. Present paper deals with transformation of living being health by waste water treatment...|$|E
40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) {{addresses}} one {{of three}} leachfield systems associated with Test Cell A, which is located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The NTS is approximately 105 kilometers (km) (65 miles [mi]) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada (see Leachfield Work Plan Figure 1 - 1). Corrective Action Unit 500 is comprised of the Test Cell A Septic System (CAS 25 - 04 - 05) and the associated leachfield system presented in Figure 1 - 1 (FFACO, 1996). The leachfield is located 60 meters (m) (200 feet [ft]) southeast of the Building 3124 gate, and approximately 45 m (150 ft) southwest of Building 3116 at Test Cell A. Test Cell A operated during the 1960 s to support nuclear rocket reactor testing {{as part of the}} Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) (SNPO, 1970). Various operations within Buildings 3113 B (Mechanical Equipment Room), 3115 (Helium Compressor Station), 3116 (Pump House), a water <b>tank</b> <b>drain</b> and overflow, a ''yard and equipment drain system'' outside of Building 3116, and a trailer have resulted in potentially hazardous effluent releases to the leachfield system (DOE, 1988 a). The leachfield system components include discharge lines, manways, a septic tank, an outfall line, a diversion chamber, and a 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) leachfield (see Leachfield Work Plan Figure 3 - 1 for explanation of terminology). In addition, engineering drawings show an outfall system {{that may or may not}} be connected to the CAU 500 leachfield. In general, effluent contributed to the leachfield was sanitary wastewater associated with floor drains, toilet and lavatory facilities in Building 3113 B and floor drains in the remaining source buildings. The surface and subsurface soils in the vicinity of the collection system, outfall, and leachfield may have been impacted by effluent containing contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) generated by support activities associated with Test Cell A reactor testing operations...|$|E

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is an 8 MW reactor {{that was}} {{operated}} at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) from 1965 through 1969. The reactor used a unique liquid salt fuel, {{composed of a}} mixture of LIF, BeF{sub 2 }, ZrF{sub 4 }, and UF{sub 4 }, and operated at temperatures above 600 {degrees}C. The primary fuel salt circulation system consisted of the reactor vessel, a single fuel salt pump, and a single primary heat exchanger. Heat was transferred from the fuel salt to a coolant salt circuit in the primary heat exchanger. The coolant salt {{was similar to the}} fuel salt, except that it contains only LiF (66 %) and BeF, (34 %). The coolant salt passed from the primary heat exchanger to an air-cooled radiator and a coolant salt pump, and then returned to the primary heat exchanger. Each of the salt loops was provided with <b>drain</b> <b>tanks,</b> located such that the salt could be drained out of either circuit by gravity. A single <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> was provided for the non-radioactive coolant salt. Two <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> were provided for the fuel salt. Since the fuel salt contained radioactive fuel, fission products, and activation products, and since the reactor was designed such that the fuel salt could be drained immediately into the <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> {{in the event of a}} problem in the fuel salt loop, the fuel salt <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> were provided with a system to remove the heat generated by radioactive decay. A third <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> connected to the fuel salt loop was provided for a batch of flush salt. This batch of salt, similar in composition to the coolant salt, was used to condition the fuel salt loop after it had been exposed to air and to flush the fuel salt loop of residual fuel salt prior to accessing the reactor circuit for maintenance or experimental activities. This report discusses the disposition of the fluoride fuel and flush salt...|$|R

5000|$|The third lunar landing {{expedition}} Apollo 13 in April 1970, was aborted and {{the lives}} of the crew, James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, were threatened by failure of a cryogenic liquid oxygen tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by fuel cells to the command spacecraft. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the lunar landing craft as a [...] "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The <b>tank's</b> <b>drain</b> fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test, which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation, because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.|$|R
