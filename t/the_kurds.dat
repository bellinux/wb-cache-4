5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got <b>the</b> <b>Kurds,</b> and if <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> spin loose and join with <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

50|$|According to René Dussaud, {{the region}} of Kurd-Dagh and the plain near Antioch were settled by Kurds since antiquity. Stefan Sperl says {{that there is a}} reason to believe that Kurdish {{settlements}} in <b>the</b> <b>Kurd</b> Mountains go back to the Seleucid era, since those regions stood in the path to Antioch; <b>Kurds</b> in <b>the</b> early periods served as mercenaries and mounted archers. In any case, <b>the</b> <b>Kurd</b> Mountains were already Kurdish-inhabited when the Crusades broke {{out at the end of}} the 11th century.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kurds</b> are {{the largest}} non-Turkic ethnicity, around 18–25 percent of the population. Kurds are {{concentrated}} {{in the east and}} southeast of the country, in what is also known as Turkish Kurdistan, making up a majority in the provinces of Tunceli, Bingöl, Muş, Ağrı, Iğdır, Elâzığ, Diyarbakır, Batman, Şırnak, Bitlis, Van, Mardin, Siirt and Hakkari, a near majority in Şanlıurfa province (47%), and a large minority in Kars province (20%). In addition, due to internal migration, Kurdish communities exist in all major cities in central and western Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, where there are an estimated 3 million Kurds, making Istanbul the city with the largest Kurdish population in the world. The minorities besides <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> are thought to make up an estimated 7–12 percent of the population.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam {{opened a}} {{campaign}} against al-Baridi in early spring 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and {{decided to return to}} Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of Kurdish brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> stabbed him in the back with his lance.|$|E
5|$|The Kurdish {{geographical}} name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish {{geographical name}} changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980.|$|E

5|$|From the nationalists' {{point of}} view, the Assyrian Levies were British proxies {{to be used}} by their 'masters' to destroy the new Iraqi state whose {{independence}} the British had consistently opposed. The British allowed their Assyrian auxiliary troops to retain their arms and granted them special duty and privileges: guarding military air installations and receiving higher pay than the Iraqi Arab recruits. Under British protection, the Assyrian Levies did not become Iraqi citizens after until 1924. The nationalists believed the British were hoping for the Assyrians to destroy Iraq's internal cohesion by becoming independent and by inciting others such as <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> to follow their example.|$|E
5|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{was born}} al-Hasan ibn Abdallah, {{the eldest son}} of Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah ibn Hamdan (died 929), son of Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith, who gave his name to the Hamdanid dynasty. The Hamdanids were {{a branch of the}} Banu Taghlib, an Arab tribe {{resident}} {{in the area of the}} Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) since pre-Islamic times. The Taghlibs had traditionally controlled Mosul and its region until the late 9th century, when the Abbasid government tried to impose firmer control over the province. Hamdan ibn Hamdun was one of the most determined Taghlibi leaders in opposing this move. Notably, in his effort to fend off the Abbasids, he secured the alliance of <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> living in the mountains north of Mosul, a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family's later fortunes. Family members intermarried with Kurds, who were also prominent in the Hamdanid military.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the Horns of Hattin, {{near the}} village of Hattin. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against <b>the</b> <b>Kurds.</b> As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor {{dissertation}} {{will focus}} on America’s policy regarding <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> and their quest for autonomy between 1958 and 1975, {{in the context of}} Washington’s seventeen year-long Cold War competition during these years with the Soviet Union for influence in Iraq. Was foreign policy of the United States towards <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> contradictory or consistent between 1958 and 1975 ? What factors determined Washington’s policy towards <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> between 1958 and 1975 ? And what factors caused it to change? These are the main research questions which should provide sufficient insight in Washington’s motives and goals which determined its policy on <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds,</b> and should explain how that policy finally took shape. First of all, Washington’s main policy interests in relation to <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> during General Qasim’s regime from 1958 till 1963 will be examined. Second, the main U. S. policy interests regarding <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> during <b>the</b> Ba’athist regime of 1963 and during the presidencies of the brothers Arif will be investigated. And finally, these same U. S. policy interests will be examined during the Ba’athist regime of President al-Bakr from July 1968, until the 1975 Algiers Agreement between Iran and Iraq. During these three separate periods, this dissertation will also focus on how these U. S. interests were eventually pursued...|$|R
5|$|Theophilos {{found himself}} {{isolated}} with his tagmata and <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> {{on the hill}} of Anzen. The Arabs proceeded to surround the hill, but the Byzantines were saved by a sudden rain, which loosened the strings of the Turkish bows, rendering them useless. Afshin then sent for catapults to be brought up to batter the Byzantine position. At the same time, Theophilos's officers, afraid of treachery by the Kurdish troops, persuaded him to withdraw. Breaking through the Arab lines and suffering many wounds in the process (the sources variously credit Manuel, who was severely wounded and possibly died soon after, and Theophobos for saving the Emperor), Theophilos and his small escort managed to reach safety at Chiliokomon, where he gradually re-assembled the remnants of his army.|$|E
5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as <b>the</b> <b>Kurds.</b> Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E
25|$|Genetic testing amongst {{randomly}} chosen Kurdish populations {{has begun}} to shed light into the disparate origins of <b>the</b> <b>Kurds.</b> The results reveal a variety of connections amongst <b>the</b> <b>Kurds,</b> when assessing paternal and maternal lineages.

25|$|<b>The</b> ethnonym <b>Kurd</b> may {{ultimately}} derive from an ancient toponym {{in the upper}} Tigris basin.

25|$|In their {{literature}} and writings, the Assyrians of Baghdida remember vividly the raids of the Persians and Kurds on their village and churches. In 1171, while {{the governors of}} Mosul and Damascus were fighting each other, <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> used the opportunity to attack the Mar Mattai monastery. According to the 13th century writer Bar Hebraeus, in 1261 <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> came down to Mosul, killing many Christians who refused to follow Islam and looting their homes and churches. <b>The</b> <b>Kurds</b> then occupied the nunnery of Naqortaya and killed many of the nuns and others who had sought refuge there. In 1288 a battle took place between <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> and Tatars near Baghdida. In 1324 Baghdida was attacked by <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> again and many homes and four churches were burned. In 1742 the Afsharids led by Nadir Shah plundered and looted the whole region of Mosul Vilayet, including many Christian villages.|$|E
