The effect {{is based on the}} hysteretic behavior of a photothermal <b>tuning</b> <b>cycle</b> caused by the whispering gallery mode (WGM) absorption resonances that are observed when scanning the power of an infrared laser focused at the rim of a microdroplet. When locked, the microdroplet size and WGM spectrum are resilient to environmental perturbations and can be maintained for hours as the mechanism does not rely on a photobleachable dye. The bistable nature of the system is also demonstrated, enabling reversible switching between two sizes. A rate equation-based thermodynamical model of the hysteretic behavior is provided, giving good agreement with the experimental results. Our results may be used to establish stable experimental conditions for ultrahigh resolution spectroscopy of microdroplets. Other optical and biological applications that require exactly size-matched microdroplets can also benefit from the demonstrated self-stabilization mechanism. I...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCovalent {{modification}} cycles (e. g., phosphorylation-dephosphorylation) underlie most cellular signaling {{and control}} processes. Low molecular copy number, arising from compartmental segregation and slow diffusion between compartments, potentially renders these cycles vulnerable to intrinsic chemical fluctuations. How can a cell operate reliably {{in the presence}} of this inherent stochasticity? How do changes in extrinsic parameters lead to variability of response? Can cells exploit these parameters to <b>tune</b> <b>cycles</b> to different ranges of stimuli? We study the dynamics of an isolated phosphorylation cycle. Our model shows that the cycle transmits information reliably if it is tuned to an optimal parameter range, despite intrinsic fluctuations and even for small input signal amplitudes. At the same time, the cycle is sensitive to changes in the concentration and activity of kinases and phosphatases. This sensitivity can lead to significant cell-to-cell response variability. It also provides a mechanism to <b>tune</b> the <b>cycle</b> to transmit signals in various amplitude ranges. Our results show that signaling cycles possess a surprising combination of robustness and tunability. This combination makes them ubiquitous in eukaryotic signaling, optimizing signaling {{in the presence of}} fluctuations using their inherent flexibility. On the other hand, <b>cycles</b> <b>tuned</b> to suppress intrinsic fluctuations can be vulnerable to changes in the number and activity of kinases and phosphatases. Such trade-offs in robustness to intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations can influence the evolution of signaling cascades, making them the weakest links in cellular circuits...|$|R

40|$|A {{low cost}} ion beam {{measurement}} {{system has been}} developed for use at ATLAS. The system provides nondestructive phase and intensity measurement of passing ion beam bunches by sensing their electric fields. Bunches traverse a short tubular electrode thereby inducing displacement currents. These currents are brought outside the vacuum jacket where a lumped inductance resonates electrode capacitance {{at one of the}} bunching harmonic frequencies. This configuration yields a basic sensitivity of a few hundred millivolts signal per microampere of beam current. Beam induced radiofrequency signals are summed against an offset frequency generated by the master oscillator. The resulting difference frequency conveys beam intensity and bunch phase information which is sent to separate processing channels. One channel utilizes a phase locked loop to stabilize phase readings during microsecond beam drop outs. The other channel uses a linear full-wave active rectifier circuit which converts sine wave signal amplitude to a DC voltage representing beam current. Plans are in progress to install this new diagnostic at several locations in ATLAS which should help shorten the <b>tuning</b> <b>cycle</b> of new ion species...|$|E

While performance measurement is well covered by existing tools, analysis of results to understand the main sources of inefficiency and to identify opportunities for optimization is generally left to the user. Today’s {{state of the art}} performance analysis tools use instrumentation or hardware counter sampling to measure the performance of interactions between code and the target architecture during execution. Such measurements are useful to identify hotspots in applications, places where execution time is spent or where cache misses are incurred.

Due to manufacturing and material variabilities, no two identical fluid mount designs act the same. So, fluid mounts are tuned one by one before it is shipped out to customers.

40|$|The {{structural}} defects that inevitably exist in real-world carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are generally considered undesirable because they break the structural perfection and {{may result in}} drastically degraded CNT properties. On the other hand, the deliberate defect introduction can provide a possibility to tailor the tube mechanical properties.

Parallel high-resolution visualizing of {{structural defects}} suggests that the property <b>tuning</b> <b>cycles</b> are primarily attributed to the reversible conversion of defects at the atomic scale: the defects are created {{in the form of}} vacancies and interstitials under electron irradiation, and they vanish through the recombination via current-induced annealing.

40|$|Algorithmic {{choice is}} {{essential}} in any problem domain to realizing optimal computational performance. Multigrid is a prime example: {{not only is it}} possible to make choices at the highest grid resolution, but a program can switch techniques as the problem is recursively attacked on coarser grid levels to take advantage of algorithms with different scaling behaviors. Additionally, users with different convergence criteria must experiment with parameters to yield a tuned algorithm that meets their accuracy requirements. Even after a tuned algorithm has been found, users often have to start all over when migrating from one machine to another. We present an algorithm and autotuning methodology that address these issues in a near-optimal and efficient manner. The freedom of independently tuning both the algorithm and the number of iterations at each recursion level results in an exponential search space of tuned algorithms that have different accuracies and performances. To search this space efficiently, our autotuner utilizes a novel dynamic programming method to build efficient tuned algorithms from the bottom up. The results are customized multigrid algorithms that invest targeted computational power to yield the accuracy required by the user. The techniques we describe allow the user to automatically generate <b>tuned</b> multigrid <b>cycles</b> of different shapes targeted to the user’s specific combination of problem, hardware, and accuracy requirements. These cycle shapes dictate the order in which grid coarsening and grid refinement are interleaved with both iterative methods, such as Jacobi or Successive Over-Relaxation, as well as direct methods, which tend to have superior performance for small problem sizes. The need to make choices between all of these methods brings the issue of variable accuracy to the forefront. Not only must the autotuning framework compare different possible multigrid cycle shapes against each other, but it also needs the ability to compare <b>tuned</b> <b>cycles</b> against both direct and (non-multigrid) iterative methods.

40|$|Abstract: Passive fluid mounts {{have been}} in use {{for the purpose of}} cabin noise and {{vibration}} reduction in the automotive and the aerospace industry for many years. Cabin noise and vibration isolation are provided at a frequency coined “notch frequency”. The design location of the notch frequency depends on the application, but in most applications, it is designed to coincide with the longest period of constant speed. To obtain the greatest reduction in cabin noise and vibration at any desired frequency, the notch frequency needs to be as close to that desired frequency as possible. Unfortunately, the conventional passive fluid mounts have some limitations. Firstly, due to tolerances on all the fluid mount dimensions, elastomer material property variations, and variation in elastomer molding processes, the notch frequency never ends up at the right location on the first manufacturing pass. To reduce the fluid mount notch frequency <b>tuning</b> <b>cycle</b> time, a new fluid mount design is proposed. This new design consists of a conventional single-pumper fluid mount and a 3 -layer piezoelectric cantilever beam as a component that provides us a variable bottom chamber volumetric stiffness and in consequence a fluid mount with a tunable notch frequency.

40|$|The legend that Terpander {{rejected}} "four-voiced song" (τετράγηρυν ἀοιδάν) {{in favor}} of new songs on the seven-stringed lyre (ἐπτατονος φὸρμιγξ) epitomizes the Greek exposure, {{at the height of}} Assyrian power (c. 750 - 650 B. C.), to the Mesopotamian tradition of classical music. Terpander's `invention' answers clearly to the heptatony which was widely practiced in the ancient Near East, as known from the diatonic tuning system documented in the cuneiform musical tablets. "Four-voiced song" describes the traditional melodic practice of the Greek epic singer, and must be understood in terms of its inheritance from the Indo-European poetic art. The syncretism of these two music-streams may be deduced from the evidence of the later Greek theorists and musicographers. Though diatonic scales were also known in Greece, even the late theorists remembered that pride of place had been given in the Classical period to other forms of heptatony-the chromatic and enharmonic genera, tone-structures which cannot be established solely through the resonant intervals of the diatonic method. Nevertheless, these tunings were consistently seen as modifications of the diatonic-which Aristoxenus believed to be the `oldest and most natural' of the genera-and were required to conform to minimum conditions of diatony. Thus the Greek structures represent the overlay of native musical inflections on a borrowed diatonic substrate, {{and the creation of a}} distinctly Hellenized form of heptatonic music. More specific points of contact are found in the string nomenclatures, which in both traditions were arranged to emphasize a central string. There is extensive Greek evidence relating this `epicentric' structure to musical function, with the middle string acting as a type of tonal center of constant pitch, while the other strings could change from tuning to tuning. So too in the Mesopotamian system the central string remained constant throughout the diatonic <b>tuning</b> <b>cycle.</b> Hence the melic revolution of the Archaic period represents the fruit of an Assyrianizing, diatonicizing musical movement...|$|E

Here, we provide functional evidence from the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that glucose can mediate TOR activity via {{the product of a}} novel carbon- responsive gene, ABL 1, in order to <b>tune</b> cell <b>cycle</b> progression during infection-related development. Under nutrient-free conditions, wild type (WT) M. oryzae strains form terminal plant-infecting cells (appressoria) at the tips of germ tubes emerging from three-celled spores (conidia). WT appressorial development is accompanied by one round of mitosis followed by autophagic cell death of the conidium. In contrast, Δabl 1 mutant strains undergo multiple rounds of accelerated mitosis in elongated germ tubes, produce few appressoria, and are abolished for autophagy. Treating WT spores with glucose or 2 -deoxyglucose phenocopied Δabl 1. Inactivating TOR in Δabl 1 mutants or glucose-treated WT strains restored appressorium formation by promoting mitotic arrest at G 1 /G 0 via an appressorium- and autophagy-inducing cell cycle delay at G 2 /M. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel glucose- ABL 1 -TOR signaling axis and shows it engages two metabolic checkpoints in order to modulate cell <b>cycle</b> <b>tuning</b> and mediate terminal appressorial cell differentiation.
