The events of <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Light takes place during {{the latter half of}} the toyline's 2002–2003 narrative.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Kini Nui, a great temple at the island's centre, Jaller and Takua {{are confronted}} by all six Rahkshi. The six Toa mount a united {{offensive}} and defeat five of them, but a surviving Rahkshi attacks Takua. Jaller sacrifices himself to protect Takua, and Jaller's final words prompt Takua to don <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Light: the Mask transforms him into Takanuva, the Toa of Light. Defeating the final Rakhshi, he constructs a craft {{powered by the}} worm-like creatures inside the Rahkshi to guide him to Makuta. Traveling to his lair beneath Mata Nui, the two hold a Kohlii contest for the island's fate. At Takanuva's bidding, the Toa, Turaga and Matoran gather together in the chamber, and witness Takanuva merging with Makuta to form a single powerful being. With Takanuva's willpower dominant, the being raises a gate leading deeper beneath the island, through which the gathered people flee. The being also revives Jaller before the gate collapses on top of it. The Turaga proceed to awaken Mata Nui using <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Light, which in turn revives Takanuva. The film ends with Takanuva discovering , the Matoran's original home.|$|E
5|$|Director Martin Campbell had {{developed}} a reputation for handling action thrillers with credits including The Professionals (1977–1983), Minder (1979–1994) and Shoestring (1979–1980).

Suddenly, a group of Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members arrive on horseback, seeking one of the players: Josh Exley (Jesse L. Martin), a talented black baseball player.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro {{caught the}} {{attention}} of European Royalty with the film's foreign premieres. Spain's King Juan Carlos I, Queen Sophia, and Princess Elena attended the first Royal premiere in Madrid in seven years. On December 10, 1998, a Royal Command Performance for Zorro was toplined by Prince Charles and his sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} photography for {{the film}} began in Mexico on January 27, 1997 on a $60 million budget. <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro was mostly shot at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. Production stalled for four days in February when the director, Martin Campbell, was hospitalized for bronchitis. Filming resumed in Tlaxcala, three hours east of Mexico City, where the production crew constructed the Montero hacienda and town set pieces. Sony sent David Foster to join the project as a producer to help fill the void left by Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, who were busy running DreamWorks. Foster and David S. Ward, who went uncredited, re-wrote some scenes; the troubled production caused <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro to go $10 million over its budget. In December, the producers were frustrated by customs agents when some props and other items, including Zorro's plastic sword, were held for nine days. During the post-production phase, Spielberg and Campbell decided that Diego de la Vega's death {{in the arms of}} his daughter was too depressing. The ending, where Alejandro and Eléna are happily married with their infant son, was added three months after filming had ended.|$|E

5|$|Producer Steven Spielberg had {{initially}} developed the film for TriStar Pictures with directors Mikael Salomon and Robert Rodriguez, before Campbell signed on in 1996. Salomon cast Sean Connery as Don Diego de la Vega, while Rodriguez brought Banderas {{in the lead}} role. Connery dropped out and was replaced with Hopkins, and <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro began filming in January 1997 at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, Mexico. The film was released in the United States on July 17, 1998 to critical and commercial success. The Legend of Zorro, a sequel also starring Banderas and Zeta-Jones and directed by Campbell, was released in 2005, but did not fare {{as well as its}} predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zorro (2005), {{a sequel}} to <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro, saw Zeta-Jones reprise her role of Eléna {{opposite}} Banderas. Set 10 {{years after the first}} film, the sequel follows Eléna struggling with married life. Unlike the original, the film was disliked by critics and was a commercial disappointment. She did not have any film releases in 2006. A biopic of Harry Houdini, entitled Death Defying Acts (2007), starring Guy Pearce as the escapologist Houdini, featured Zeta-Jones as a Scottish con artist who claims psychic powers. The unsuccessful production was given only a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date {{was changed to}} March 1998. There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her acting career, Zeta-Jones supports various charities and causes. She is a patron of Swansea's Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has made sizeable donations to the centre. In 2001, she auctioned an outfit she wore in <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Zorro (1998) {{to raise funds for}} AIDS patients in Africa. In 2005, she became the ambassador of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children charity, and launched the Full Stop appeal in Wales to raise awareness on child abuse. She has also given her support to other charitable organisations for children such as the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children and the Noah's Ark Appeal, among others. Zeta-Jones is also the founding host for A Fine Romance, an annual charitable program that helps raise funds for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, {{and is one of the}} members of the Cinema for Peace Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom I, the 18th Military Police Brigade crossed into Iraq on 22 March 2003. During its year of deployment, the brigade {{established}} Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 Iraqi prisoners and conducted main supply route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing the new Iraqi Police Service and rebuilding Iraqi police stations. From {{the beginning of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 Iraqi police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> <b>of</b> Warka, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.|$|E
5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E
