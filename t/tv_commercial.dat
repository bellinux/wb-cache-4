5|$|A {{television}} {{advertisement for}} Late Registration was directed and animated by Maggie Rogers, Abby Johnson and Paul Tuersley of Mr & Mrs Smith Design Ltd. It featured a gigantic version of West's teddy bear mascot Dropout Bear roaming {{through the streets}} of London. The advert received an award from British music magazine Music Week for Best Music <b>TV</b> <b>Commercial.</b> On the day of the album's release, West made an in-store appearance at New York's Lincoln Center Tower Records to autograph copies for fans. That same day, Late Registration was released in its entirety for online streaming on AOL Music.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{investigate}} {{what kinds of}} feelings consumers have while watching <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> {{in the presence of}} words (lines, a jingle, a sound logo, and on-screen words) that were later remembered, by using an electroencephalogram (EEG) and questionnaires. Every day, a great number of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> are broadcasting. Since <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> have become indispensable advertising media, it is essential for advertising agencies to create attractive and memorable <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> for consumers. This leads to many evaluations of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials.</b> Yet, few studies focused on consumers’ feelings during <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> along with words that remained in their minds afterward. In order to reveal this point, we carry out an experiment with Japanese award-winning and non-award-winning <b>TV</b> <b>commercials.</b> We also examine effects of words on consumers’ memories with time: soon after watching, a day later, a week later, and a month later. As the results of our EEG analysis, different consumers’ feelings were obtained in different cases. There was a strong correlation between concentration and stress while watching the award-winning <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> along with words, which consumers remembered not only soon after watching but also a month later. However, this tendency was not applicable to the non-award-winning <b>TV</b> <b>commercials.</b> Thus, we consider that the effects of memorable <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> along with words on consumers’ feelings could vary depending on winning an award or not...|$|R

The author of this work finds out by questionnaire survey if women watch the <b>TV</b> <b>commercials,</b> how do commercials effect them, what kind of commercial do women remember most often and if women let the commercials to influence them. The important question also is if recent <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> support the healthy lifestyle. The results of the questionnaire survey confirmed most women do not watch the <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> and they do not let the commercials to influence them. Those commercials which were remembered by most women didnt lead to healthy lifestyles motivation. Most women also think <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> do not support healhy lifestyle at all...|$|R

The objective is to offer a general guideline in the postproduction of tourism <b>TV</b> <b>commercials.</b> It is found that tourism <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> tend to be produced in a faster tempo with beats per minute close to 120, which is rare {{to be found in}} general <b>TV</b> <b>commercials.</b> To compensate for the faster tempo (increased aural information load), less scenes (longer duration per scene) were edited into the footage.

5|$|Claire {{appeared}} in George A.

Several action figures of Claire were released by various manufacturers, including one by Toy Biz in 1998, {{as well as two}} by Moby Dick Toys, two by Palisades Toys, and one by Volks in 2001. A Claire block-style figure was also released by Dragon in the Kubrick's Resident Evil line, while Vanilla Chop produced a resin kit. One of costumes for the character C. Viper in the fighting game Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was inspired by Claire's iconic look in Resident Evil 2.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{disturbed}} by the box of Mr. Sparkle, contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaidō, Japan for information. He is sent a promotional video for Mr. Sparkle, which consists of a <b>TV</b> <b>commercial.</b> At {{the end of the}} video, the mascot is shown to be a result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates, Matsumura Fishworks and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern. Their mascots, a smiling anime fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle. Thus, Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{brain activity}} during {{the observation of}} <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> by tracking the cortical activity and the functional connectivity changes in normal subjects. The aim was to elucidate if the <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that were remembered by the subjects several days after their first observation elicited particular brain activity and connectivity compared with those generated during the observation of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that were quickly forgotten. High-resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were performed {{in a group of}} healthy subjects and the cortical activity during the observation of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> was evaluated in several regions of interest coincident with the Brodmann areas (BAs). The patterns of cortical connectivity were obtained in the four principal frequency bands, Theta (3 - 7 Hz), Alpha (8 - 12 Hz), Beta (13 [...] 30 Hz), Gamma (3040 Hz) and the directed influences between any given pair of the estimated cortical signals were evaluated by use of a multivariate spectral technique known as partial directed coherence. The topology of the cortical networks has been identified with tools derived from graph theory. Results suggest that the cortical activity and connectivity elicited by the viewing of the <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that were remembered by the experimental subjects are markedly different from the brain activity elicited during the observation of the <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that were forgotten. In particular, during the observation of the <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that were remembered, the amount of cortical spectral activity from the frontal areas (BA 8 and 9) and from the parietal areas (BA 5, 7, and 40) is higher compared with the activity elicited by the observation of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that were forgotten. In addition, network analysis suggests a clear role of the parietal areas as a target of the incoming flow of information from all the other parts of the cortex during the observation of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> that have been remembered. The techniques presented here shed new light on all the cortical networks and their behavior during the memorization of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials.</b> Such techniques could also be relevant in neuroeconomics and neuromarketing for the investigation of the neural substrates subserving other decision-making and recognition tasks...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is}} to elucidate if the remembering of <b>TV</b> <b>commercials</b> elicits particular brain activity and connectivity.
