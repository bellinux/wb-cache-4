5|$|As the {{district}} is on <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabian sea, fishing {{is one of the}} major occupation of many people. The major fishing places are Bunder (Old harbour), Panambur, Surathkal, Kotekar and Sasihitlu.|$|E
5|$|A 16th-century water gate in {{the eastern}} wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is {{the base of a}} doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.|$|E
50|$|The city's {{location}} on the Rio Paraguay provides a prime location for boating and fishing.

5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill {{is the site of}} Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the highway runs parallel to the former Highway2 along <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saint Lawrence River within the Saint Lawrence Valley.

5|$|After leaving school, Smith studied {{drama and}} {{creative}} {{writing at the}} University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles {{as part of the}} National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon in The Master and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On <b>the</b> <b>Shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade camped to the north of Tiberias, at Medjel on <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Galilee. A squadron of the 9th Light Horse Regiment rode out at 12:30 to investigate reports of a considerable enemy force at Safed. By the time they arrived at 18:00, the force had withdrawn. Meanwhile, the 8th Light Horse Regiment restored order in the town and established guards on stores of grain while the remainder of the brigade rested after their night-time advance.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|In the Fruitland Formation of New Mexico, P. cyrtocristatus shared its habitat {{with other}} ornithischians and theropods. Specifically, its contemporaries were the ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii; the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras novomexicanum; and some {{unidentified}} fossils belonging to Tyrannosauridae, ?Ornithomimus, ?Troodontidae, ?Saurornitholestes langstoni, ?Struthiomimus, Ornithopoda, ?Chasmosaurus, ?Corythosaurus, Hadrosaurinae, Hadrosauridae, and Ceratopsidae. When Parasaurolophus existed, the Fruitland Formation was swampy, positioned in the lowlands, {{and close to}} <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The lowermost part of the Fruitland Formation is just younger than 75.56 ± 0.41mya, with the uppermost boundary dating to 74.55 ± 0.22mya.|$|E
5|$|Liman von Sanders {{was forced}} to {{withdraw}} from Nazareth {{in the early morning}} when the 5th Cavalry Division unsuccessfully attacked the town. During his journey to Deraa, Liman von Sanders ordered the establishment of a rearguard line running from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. If this line, across the two main roads and railway lines to Damascus could be held, time could be gained for the consolidation of the retreating columns into a strong defence of Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{initially}} {{aspired to}} be a professional footballer, but spondylolysis forced him out of the sport. After joining the National Youth Theatre and studying Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia, he became an actor in 2003, performing in plays like Murder in the Cathedral, Fresh Kills, The History Boys, and On <b>the</b> <b>Shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wide World in London theatres. Extending his repertoire into West End theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of Swimming with Sharks with Christian Slater, followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance as Henry in That Face.|$|E
5|$|The North Shore {{branch of}} the SIRT began at Saint George Terminal, using the northernmost {{platform}} and tracks of the terminal. After running through the St. George Freight Yard (near the modern Ballpark Station), the line ran on <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kill Van Kull from New Brighton to West Brighton. The line ran on land between St. George and New Brighton, and on a ballast-filled wood trestle supported by a wood retaining wall through Livingston and West Brighton. Though the right-of-way is distinguishable, little evidence of {{this portion of the}} line exists today, except for abandoned tracks and supports, much of which has eroded into the kull.|$|E
5|$|The Song were {{fortified}} {{along the}} Yangtze front. Wanyan Liang planned {{to cross the}} river at Caishi, south of modern-day Nanjing. He embarked from <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yangtze on November 26, and clashed with Song forces led by Yu Yunwen in a naval engagement. Wanyan Liang lost the battle and retreated to Yangzhou. Wanyan Liang was assassinated in a military camp by his own men shortly after the Caishi battle. A military coup {{had taken place in}} the Jin court while Wanyan Liang was absent, enthroning Emperor Shizong as the new emperor. A peace treaty signed in 1165 ended the conflict between Song and Jin.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} Exit34 and {{progresses}} north towards Lake Huron. This mostly straight {{section of the}} route lies within Lambton County and passes through the town of Forest. Near Kettle Point, the route abruptly curves north west and begins to parallel <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake, providing access {{to the village of}} Port Franks and The Pinery Provincial Park prior to entering Grand Bend. North of that village, the highway crosses into Huron County and intersects former Highway83. Between this point and Goderich, {{the west side of the}} highway is dominated by roads providing access to shoreline cottages.|$|E
5|$|During the {{unsuccessful}} {{attack of}} the 5th Cavalry Division on Nazareth {{in the early morning}} of 20 September, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group commanding three Ottoman armies, Generalleutnant (comparable to a British Major General) Otto Liman von Sanders escaped to Damascus, travelling via Tiberias, Samakh and Deraa. He alerted the garrisons he passed to the advance of the EEF and ordered the establishment of a rearguard line. The line was to run from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. Two main roads and the railway lines to Damascus, would be protected and time gained {{for the development of the}} defence of Damascus, if the garrisons were not defeated. Von Sanders and three senior Yildirim Army Group staff officers reached Tiberias during the afternoon of 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Early European (primarily from England, Ireland and France) {{settlement}} in Newfoundland {{was confined to}} the coast. The rich cod fishery on the Grand Banks and along <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island was {{the primary reason for}} these settlements. The rugged shoreline provided many small, but isolated, harbors (outports) from which to conduct the fishery. The Avalon Peninsula was, and is, the most populous part of the island, and as such had the best developed system of early roads and trails. Transportation between communities on other parts of the coast, especially the south coast between Fortune Bay and Port aux Basques, was exclusively by boat. Almost all communities are now accessible by roads which are part of the provincial road system. The now-defunct Newfoundland Railway, built {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century, and the development of the lead, zinc and copper mine at Buchans and the paper mill in Grand Falls in the early 20th century marked the beginning of the settlement of the interior of the island. Despite these developments the majority of the population is still found along the coast.|$|E
