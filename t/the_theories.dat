40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures {{based on the}} reduction of complex theories to simpler ones. Specifically, we define reduction functions {{as a tool for}} reducing the satisfiability problem of a complex <b>theory</b> to <b>the</b> satisfiability problem of a simpler one. Reduction functions allow us to reduce <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of lists to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of constructors, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of arrays to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of equality, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of sets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of equality, and <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of multisets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce the satisfiability problem of a combination of complex <b>theories</b> to <b>the</b> combination of simpler ones. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into <b>the</b> <b>theories.</b>|$|E

Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
