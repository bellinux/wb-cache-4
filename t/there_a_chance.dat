25|$|Car Free Days are {{official}} {{events with}} the common goal of taking {{a fair number of}} cars off the streets of a city or some target area or neighborhood for all or part of a day, in order to give the people who live and work <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to consider how their city might look and work with significantly fewer cars. The first events were organised in Reykjav√≠k (Iceland), Bath (UK) and La Rochelle (France) in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the four}} {{existing}} state institutions, the Party, the Chamber of Fasci and Corporations, the Senate and the Grand Council, {{only the last}} two were suitable for an action: the Senate because there were still quite a few anti- or pre-Fascist members, and the Grand Council since several members were against the Duce. In the event, a motion by 61 senators on 22 July asking to convene the Senate was blocked by Mussolini, and only the Mussolini {{had the power to}} summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. In those days, the only gerarca (except Roberto Farinacci, who started from opposite premises) with a clear plan to exit from the impasse was Dino Grandi. His idea was to depose Mussolini, let the king make a government without Fascists, {{and at the same time}} attack the German army in Italy. Only thus was <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the declaration of Casablanca could be mitigated in the case of Italy. Later, the new Party Secretary, Carlo Scorza also developed his plan. Like Farinacci, for him the only solution was the political [...] "embalming" [...] of Mussolini and the pursuit of a total war, but while Farinacci acted in close cooperation with the Germans, Scorza thought that the power should be assumed directly by the Party, which had been largely discredited in the previous few years. On 13 and 16 July several Fascists led by Farinacci met in the main seat of the Party in Piazza Colonna, and decided to go to Mussolini in Palazzo Venezia to ask for the convocation of the Grand Council. At the end of the meeting, Mussolini surprisingly consented to convoke the supreme assembly of Fascism.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come on, Silas! If <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for us Minute Boys to have {{a finger}} in any pie that is baking, don't let's linger here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{my cousin}} Ralph is happy and triumphant. I {{ought not to}} pine, but in truth I am so weak that I am always pining. Tell me at once,--is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{scarcely}} addressing her, {{and she said}} nothing. For a moment they stood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing. Then he asked her quickly, [...] "But tell me, how did it seem to you? What did you think, Katharine? Is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that she likes me? Tell me, Katharine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And ain't <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{of hearing}} {{how you are}} getting on, Dick? I shall think {{of you and your}} mother, often and often, when I am on deck keeping my watch at night; and it will seem hard that I mayn't be able to hear, for years, as to what you are doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't keep awake on my account. The sooner {{your eyes}} are closed the sooner you'll forget that <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of bein' sent to jail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make fast there, lads, an' I'll {{take a look}} below. We don't want {{to abandon}} the brig while <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of standin' by her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph's hopeless," [...] said Tom. [...] "He {{was born}} a pirate, you weren't, Hughie. We think <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for his salvation, don't we, Perry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They've {{fired the}} house," [...] Darius {{continued}} to my father, [...] "an' without givin' them {{who may be}} livin' <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to carry anythin' out. Soldiers are stationed to prevent the people from tryin' to fight the flames, an' it wouldn't surprise me if we saw a pretty hot time in this town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, master, I {{care not}} what {{takes us to}} Wales. At any rate, I am glad to journey thither; for it seems, at present, as if there, only, is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of giving and taking hard knocks. How {{is it that you}} do not take a party of men-at-arms, as you did last time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> Peter? Although, {{if there}} is none, I quite {{agree with you that}} I would rather be drowned than shot down. If one were sure of being killed by the first shot that would be the easiest death; but if we were only wounded they would {{probably}} hang us in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wall now, that bein' the kee-westion," [...] said Waller, [...] "whose a-goin' {{to answer}} it? <b>There's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> now, lads; but don't all speak at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kambira {{laid his}} hand on Harold's {{shoulder}} and pointed to it with a smile, {{which might have been}} interpreted, [...] "Now, then, <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, Rinaldo, let us set to {{work without}} <b>a</b> moment's delay. <b>There's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> we aren't going to rot in the dungeons of Genoa, after all." ...|$|R
60|$|Although, therefore, {{it is not}} {{possible}} but that, in the discussion of so many subjects as are necessarily introduced in the following pages, here and <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> should arise of minor mistake or misconception, the reader need not be disturbed by the detection of any such. He will find always that they do not affect the matter mainly in hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But tell me {{what you}} think. Somebody {{tell me what}} he thinks!' cried the wretched object,--so mean, and wretched, and despicable, that even Pity's self might have turned away, at sight of such a being in the {{likeness}} of a man--'isn't <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for me,--isn't there a good chance for me? Isn't it likely they may be doing this to frighten me? Don't you think it is? Oh!' he almost shrieked, as he wrung his hands, 'won't anybody give me comfort!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More nor that! Well, then, {{he ought}} to have come down handsome. Didn't yer run like winking, and didn't yer jump on the chap's back and knock him down, and didn't yer run back again? And warn't <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> ef one of the bobbies had got hold of yer collar and found it in yer hand, of yer being had up for {{stealing}} it? And then yer walks off and don't give him a chance of giving yer nuffin. My eye, but yer are a flat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{talk about}} that later. Jest now <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> others will find out where you are, for Joe and Bill have gone after men to help search for Billings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't you think,' whimpered Dennis, {{creeping}} up to him, {{as he stood}} with his feet rooted to the ground, gazing at the blank walls--'don't you think <b>there's</b> still <b>a</b> <b>chance?</b> It's <b>a</b> dreadful end; it's a terrible end for a man like me. Don't you think <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance?</b> I don't mean for you, I mean for me. Don't let HIM hear us (meaning Hugh); 'he's so desperate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{according}} to your ideas, those who stole the Bonita are ashore somewhere; {{so as long as}} we're obliged to stay here it's safe to say <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of trouble from them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will depend}} on the {{characters}} of individuals; most will, but some will not. You and I would be punished soon enough, were <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> but the mass would escape. Oh! we have had some precious disclosures in our corner of the car! The two or three men who joined Newcome are from anti-rent districts, and seeing me with their friend, little reserve has been practised. One of those men is an anti-rent lecturer; and, being somewhat didactic, he favoured me with some of his arguments, seriatim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It goes not on at all. Oudenarde is {{a strong}} place; it is defended by many broad ditches, and has a {{garrison}} of knights and men-at-arms of the earl, who, as we know, take upon themselves all the defence, knowing that there are men in the town who would fain surrender, and fearing that these would throw open the gates to us, or give us such aid as they could, were <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Still more, the siege goes on but slowly, or rather we may say goes on not at all, {{for want of a}} leader. Van Artevelde himself knows nothing whatever of the business of war, nor do any of those about him.|$|E
60|$|In {{the country}} round London these pests were very numerous, for here, more than {{anywhere}} else, was <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of plunder. The swamps {{on the south}} side of the river had an especially evil reputation. From Southwark to Putney stretches a marshy country over which, at high tides, the river frequently flowed. Here and there were wretched huts, difficult of access and affording good hiding-places for those pursued by justice, since searchers could be seen approaching a long way off, and escape could be made by paths across the swamp known only to the dwellers there, and where heavily-armed men dared not follow. Further south, in the wild country round Westerham, where miles of heath and forest stretched away in all directions, was another noted place where the robber vagrants mustered thickly, and the Sheriff of Kent had much trouble with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just now," [...] {{returned}} the trapper; [...] "he's not yet {{got the better}} of his touch o' starvation, an' <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> o' your friend Stalker, or Buxley, which d'ye call him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may be mistaken. All the Zanes are {{fire and}} {{brimstone}} and this girl is a Zane clear through. Go and fetch her to me, Lewis. I'll {{tell you if}} <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{which makes}} a man ready and glad to live or die for <b>a</b> principle. <b>There's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for heroes now, if there ever was. When do you join your regiment?" [...] she added, abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't spare you, John," [...] Captain Dave said. [...] "I {{have been}} mighty near making {{a mess of}} it, even with you as chief mate, and I might as well shut up shop {{altogether}} {{if you were to}} leave me. I should miss you, too, Cyril," [...] he went on, stretching his arm across the table to shake hands with the lad. [...] "You have proved a real friend and a true; but were <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of your going as an officer, I would not balk you, even if I could do so. It is but natural that a lad of spirit should speak and think as you do; besides, the war may not last for long, and when you come back, and the ships are paid off, you would soon wipe off the arrears of work, and get the books into ship-shape order. But, work or no work, that room of yours will always stand ready for you while I live, and {{there will always be a}} plate for you on this table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Were <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of success, Fergus of Killeen {{would gladly}} draw the sword again; but I will not bring ruin upon {{my family and}} people by {{engaging}} in a hopeless enterprise. Did I raise my standard, all Donegal would take up arms; but Donegal alone is powerless against England. I know my people--they {{are ready for the}} fray, they would rush to battle and perish in thousands to win victory, but one great defeat would crush them. The story of the long fight which your Wallace, with a small following, made against the power of England, will never be told of an Irish leader. We have bravery and reckless courage, but we have none of the stubborn obstinacy of your Scottish folk. Were the flag raised the people would flock to it, and would fight desperately; but if they lost, there would be utter and complete collapse. The fortitude to support repeated defeats, to struggle on when the prospect seems darkest, does not belong to my people.|$|E
5000|$|Question: If Xenosaga Episode III is {{the last}} game of the Xenosaga series no matter what, would that change based on fan {{requests}} and sales? Is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that Bandai Namco will make more games based on the Xenosaga universe (RPG or not)? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had it any {{bearing on}} my painful position? I only ask, because that's what is {{interesting}} me most just now, and, if you're {{going to change the}} subject, <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that my attention may wander." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Oh, good-bye, our dreams!" [...] said Sir Huon. [...] "It's neither sceptre, sword, nor plough! Maybe yet it's a bookful of learning, {{bound with}} iron clasps. <b>There's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for <b>a</b> splendid fortune in that sometimes." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the {{corridor}} of uncertainty {{is an area where}} a cricket ball can pitch during a delivery: a narrow line on and just outside a batsman's off stump. The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> the ball will turn inward and either bowl him or hit him with <b>an</b> increased <b>chance</b> of leg before wicket. If a batsman plays the ball, <b>there's</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> the ball will go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be easily caught.|$|R
