40|$|This thesis {{provides}} the first account of complaint in Older Scots literature. It argues for the coherent {{development of a}} distinctively Scottish complaining voice across the fifteenth century, characterised by {{an interest in the}} relationship between amatory and ethical concerns, between stasis and narrative movement, and between male and female voices. Chapter 1 examines the literary contexts of Older Scots complaint, and identifies three paradigmatic texts for the Scottish complaint tradition: Ovid’s Heroides; Boethius’s De Consolatione Philosophiae; and Alan of Lille’s De Planctu Naturae. Chapter 2 concentrates on the complaints in Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Arch. Selden. B. 24 (c. 1489 -c. 1513). It considers afresh the Scottish reception of Lydgate’s Complaint of the Black Knight and Chaucer’s Anelida and Arcite, and also offers original readings of three Scottish complaints preserved uniquely in this manuscript: the Lay of Sorrow, the Lufaris Complaynt, and the Quare of Jelusy. Chapter 3 focuses on the relationship between complaint and narrative, arguing that the complaints included in the Buik of Alexander (c. 1438), Lancelot of the Laik (c. 1460), Hary’s Wallace (c. 1476 - 8), and The Buik of King Alexander the Conquerour (c. 1460 - 99) act as catalysts for narrative movement and subvert the complaint’s traditional identity as a static form. Chapter 4 is a study of complaint in Robert Henryson’s three major works: the Morall Fabillis (c. 1480 s); the Testament of Cresseid (c. 1480 - 92); and Orpheus and Eurydice (c. 1490 - 2), and argues that Henryson consistently connects <b>the</b> <b>complaint</b> <b>form</b> with the concept of self-knowledge as part of wider discourses on effective governance. Chapter 5 presents the evidence that a text’s identity as a complaint influenced its presentation in both manuscript and print witnesses. The witnesses under discussion date predominantly from the sixteenth century; the chapter thus also uses them to explore the complaints’ later reception history. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the economic significance of state aid {{and the main}} principles of European state aid control. It starts with a definition of state aid in European context and exceptions to the general ban of state aid. Then they are explored the motives for granting state aid, ranging from the correction of market failures over political motives to political economy considerations. They are described some procedures and coordination of granting state aid, then how state aid control fits into the framework of European competition policy before we comment extensively on the more economic approach to state aid control, as implemented by the European Commission, and the state aid action plan. Control of state aid is of increasing importance {{in the context of}} European competition policy in order to maintain a fair level of activity of all enterprises participating in the European markets, regardless of the Member State in which they reside. The theoretical fundamentals of state aid are important to be studied and applied. Were distinguished and described the main approaches in the evolution of economic theories in the field of State aid. Criteria were established to determine the government's actions as state aid and intervention methods analyzed. It is important to think about the implications of state aid at an early stage. Doing so allows assistance to be designed and given more quickly and effectively and avoids potential problems later. A program of assistance that does not follow the rules could be forced to close. Giving state aid illegally could result in the money having to be clawed back with possibly very serious consequences for the recipient. The European Commission monitors and controls state aid in the EU by requiring member states to notify the Commission in advance of proposed state aid in order to ensure compliance. If a European company believes that a competitor is receiving illegal aid then they should complain directly to the Commission on <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> <b>form.</b> <b>The</b> Commission is obliged under the Procedural Regulation to act on any evidence of potential illegal aid and will therefore take complaints seriously, but all these aspects are described in the present research...|$|R
