40|$|Abstract. An {{implicit}} {{assumption of}} many {{machine learning algorithms}} is that all attributes are of the same importance. An algorithm typically selects attributes based solely on their statistical characteristics, without considering their semantic interpretations. In order <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>difficulties</b> associated with this unrealistic assumption, many researchers attempted to introduce user judgements {{of the importance of}} attributes into machine learning. However, there is still a lack of formal framework. Based on decision theory and measurement theory, a model of user-oriented reduct construction is proposed for machine learning by considering the user preference of attributes. It seamlessly combines internal information and external information. User preferences of attributes are extended to user preferences of attribute sets. Accordingly, user preferred reducts can be constructed...|$|E

The predicted flow coefficient, net head coefficient, and overall efficiency showed a good agreement with the experimental data. Based on the validation of the numerical results, the pattern of wet area on the bucket inner surface has been analyzed at different rotational speeds, and an attempt to find the connection between rotational speeds, torque, and efficiency has been made...|$|E

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{thorough}} investigation of three-dimensional flow in a cubical cavity, subject to a constant velocity lid on its roof. In this steady-state analysis, we adopt the mixed formulation on triquadratic elements to preserve mass conservation. <b>To</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>difficulties</b> in the asymmetric and indefinite large-size matrix equations, we apply the BiCGSTAB solution solver. To achieve stability, weighting functions are designed in favor of variables on the upstream side. To achieve accuracy, the weighting functions are properly chosen so that false diffusion errors can be largely suppressed by the equipped streamline operator. Our aim is to gain some physical insight into the vortical flow using a theoretically rigorous topological theory.

In iterative improvement methods for multiple alignment, the socalled group-to-group two-dimensional dynamic programming has been used, and in this respect our proposal is to extend the ordinary two-group dynamic programming to a k- group alignment programming. This extension is conceptually straightforward, and here our contribution is {{to demonstrate that the}} k-group alignment can be implemented so as to run in a reasonable time and space under standard computing environments. This is established by generalizing the A 3 search approach for multiple alignment devised by Ikeda and Imai [8]. The k-group alignment method can [...] ...|$|E
