5|$|Most {{recreation}} {{takes place}} around Lake Inari, although {{a limited number}} of visitors hike into the fells. The reserve is a demanding hiking area and inexperienced hikers are recommended to avoid traversing the wilderness. The freedom to roam grants everyone the right <b>to</b> <b>hike,</b> ski and short-term camping everywhere in the area. The park can be accessed from National Road 971 and 969; public transport is available to Nellim.|$|E
5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5|$|They move {{deeper into}} the woods {{the next day and}} locate what appears to be an old {{cemetery}} with seven small cairns and set up camp nearby. Later that night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{breaches}} in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued to pour into inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses sustained by the pearl industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese pearl costs <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected to persist for two to three years.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the wheelhouse. Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E
5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E

5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had <b>to</b> <b>hike</b> through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, a man {{traveling}} over Bear Camp Road {{died after}} being stranded for nine weeks. The victim, Dewitt Finley, was a camper salesman from Montana. He {{was attempting to}} drive from Gold Beach to Grants Pass and became snowbound. He kept a journal while stranded on the road, and ultimately died of starvation. His body wasn't recovered until May 1995, when it was discovered {{by a group of}} local teenagers.

25|$|After {{his return}} to the United States in 1910, Harold Weston was {{stricken}} by polio. His left leg was paralyzed.

25|$|Camping {{and hiking}} are an {{integral}} part of Israeli culture. National parks and nature reserves across Israel register some 6.5 million visits a year.
