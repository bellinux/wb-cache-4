25|$|In the {{judgment}} of these Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church is in fact teaching {{as a matter of}} Roman Catholic dogma that the Holy Spirit derives his origin and being (equally) from both the Father and the Son, making the Filioque a double procession. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> thing that Maximus the Confessor was stating in his work from the 7th century that would be wrong and that the West was not doing.|$|E

Either Brewster's angle reflections or interference effects in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting polarizers. The substrate for the film can either be a plate, which is inserted into the beam at a particular angle, or a wedge of glass that is cemented to a second wedge to form a cube with the film cutting diagonally across the center (one form of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> common MacNeille cube).|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} Heckscher–Ohlin model {{assumes that}} the production functions are identical for all countries concerned. This means that all countries {{are in the same}} level of production and have the same technology, yet this is highly unrealistic. Technological gap between developed and developing countries is the main concern for the development of poor countries. The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model ignores all these vital factors when one wants to consider development of less developed countries in the international context. Even between developed countries, technology differs from industry to industry and firm to firm base. Indeed, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> basis of the competition between firms, inside the country and across the country. See the New Trade Theory in this article below.|$|E
25|$|Again {{the pure}} being of Hegel {{is a mere}} abstraction,--a {{hypothesis}} illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point to be established {{is the possibility of}} reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> thing assumed as a starting-point. Besides this, of course, objections might be made to the method of development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction, but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as above consciousness, the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction, unvindicated, illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily'developed, are equally useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding by essential knowledge of being, to ground it in an analysis of consciousness,--in psychology.|$|E
25|$|The {{reality is}} not so clear-cut. The most {{advanced}} fusion programs {{in the world are}} inertial confinement fusion (such as National Ignition Facility) and magnetic confinement fusion (such as ITER and other tokamaks). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050. In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> low Coulomb barrier for this reaction; for D+3He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for 3He–3He. The immense cost of reactors like ITER and National Ignition Facility are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D–3He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for helium-3 fusion reactions are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.|$|E

500|$|Avicenna anticipates {{that one}} could reject the {{argument}} {{by saying that the}} collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in mathematics a set of numbers is not a number. Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong. However, Avicenna dismisses this counter-argument as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the very thing Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, [...] "in a certain way, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> thing that is sought".|$|E

2500|$|An {{electric}} field is the force field {{that is the}} property of one electric charge (such as a single electron) that will affect a second charge by repelling or attracting that second charge. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> powerful physical force that tightly holds all matter together. [...] Feynman: This {{electric field}} is a vector field that associates to each point in space the force, called the Coulomb force, that would be experienced per unit of charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point. Electric fields are created by electric charges, and by time-varying magnetic fields. The electric field and the magnetic field together form the electromagnetic field, {{one of the four}} fundamental forces of nature.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Hōnen read a Pure Land Buddhist text {{called the}} Commentaries on the Amitayurdhyana Sutra (...) {{authored}} by the Chinese Pure Land master Shandao (613-681), notably the statement, [...] "Only repeat {{the name of}} Amitabha with all your heart. [...] Whether walking or standing, sitting or lying, never cease the practice of it even for a moment. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> work which unfailingly issues in salvation, for it is {{in accordance with the}} Original Vow of that Buddha." [...] This commentary persuaded Hōnen to believe that nianfo, called nembutsu in Japanese, was all one needed to enter Amitābha's pure land. Previously, nianfo was recited along with other practices, but Shandao was the first to propose that only nianfo was necessary. [...] This new appreciation and understanding prompted Hōnen to leave Mt. Hiei and the Tendai tradition in 1175.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is mainly}} {{due to the}} low value of leakage through the cable insulator, which is even more {{pronounced}} in modern cables which have better insulators than in Heaviside's day. [...] In {{order to meet the}} condition, the choices are therefore to try to increase G or L or to decrease R or C. [...] Decreasing R requires larger conductors. [...] Copper was already in use in telegraph cables and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> best conductor available short of using silver. [...] Decreasing R means using more copper and a more expensive cable. [...] Decreasing C would also mean a larger cable (although not necessarily more copper). [...] Increasing G is highly undesirable; while it would reduce distortion, it would at the same time increase the signal loss. [...] Heaviside considered, but rejected, this possibility which left him with the strategy of increasing L as the way to reduce distortion.|$|E
