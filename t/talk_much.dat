25|$|In September 1916, Christie {{enlisted in}} the army; he was called up in April 1917 to join the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, {{to serve as an}} infantryman. In April 1918, the {{regiment}} was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute {{for three and a half}} years. His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas. That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.|$|E

500|$|Marmarosa {{departed}} for California by car in 1960, but {{problems with the}} vehicle halted him in Chicago. Promoter Joe Segal organized an Argo Records session for him there, but Marmarosa departed suddenly and the recording was delayed until the following year. The resultant trio music from two days in May was released as Dodo's Back! in 1962. Leonard Feather described it as [...] "required listening for anyone with a serious interest {{in the history of}} modern jazz piano", but it failed to gain Marmarosa more than a brief resurgence of interest. He made his final studio recordings in 1962. One album from these, Jug & Dodo, contained trio and quartet tracks, with saxophonist Gene Ammons; it was released on Prestige Records more than a decade later. The other, in a quartet with trumpeter Bill Hardman, was released in 1988. Segal commented that Marmarosa [...] "didn't <b>talk</b> <b>much,</b> was very mild-mannered. He just drank an awful lot, shot and a beer all day long. It would've put nine out of ten people under the table, but he was still walking around." [...] The pianist shuttled between Chicago and Pittsburgh for a time, then settled again in the latter.|$|E

2500|$|Xu Chu {{was known}} to be a {{cautious}} and serious person who did not <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> and was very mindful of rules and regulations. Once, Cao Cao's cousin Cao Ren came from Jing Province to meet Cao Cao – who had recently received the title of a vassal king, King of Wei (魏王), from Emperor Xian – in the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). Cao Cao was still in his personal chambers, with Xu Chu standing guard outside, when Cao Ren arrived. Cao Ren asked Xu Chu to join him in the side room for a chat. However, Xu Chu replied, [...] "The King is coming out soon." [...] He then entered Cao Cao's chambers. Cao Ren was very unhappy with Xu Chu. Later, someone told Xu Chu, [...] "The General (Cao Ren) is a close relative and important subject of the King. He lowered himself when he asked to chat with you. How could you reject him?" [...] Xu Chu responded, [...] "He may be a close relative and important subject of the King, but he's in charge of external defences at the borders. I, Xu Chu, am in charge of internal security. If he wanted to chat with me, we could do so in public. Why did he ask to chat with me in private?" [...] Cao Cao was impressed and he favoured Xu Chu even more after he heard about the incident, so he promoted him to Central Resolute General (中堅將軍).|$|E
2500|$|The European {{roots of}} the {{community}} are predominantly from small German states which are comprised by the Germany of today and from the region known as Montbéliard in eastern France. [...] Waterloo Settlement's first settlers were {{sons and daughters of}} second and third-generation German and Montbéliardian immigrants brought to Nova Scotia as loyal citizens to the British crown in 1750–52. The French-speaking Montbéliardians were considered good candidates to emigrate since they were known to be [...] "very frugal, as well as strong independent laborers" [...] (Withrow, 2002). [...] As for the Germans (and likely the Swiss), Judge Debrisay quotes a number of stereotypes and impressions that developed and existed of the first German immigrants up to 1895, at least 140 years after their arrival. [...] "They are a big, square-shouldered, deep-chested race. [...] They do not <b>talk</b> <b>much,</b> but look as though they thought—easy going, and good tempered... they are hearty eaters, but they are not fussy and finikin over their food... so long as the dish is wholesome, and there is sufficient of it, they are satisfied... in the sensuous arts of painting and sculpture, the Germans are poor. [...] In the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great, and this fact provides a key to their character. [...] They are simple, earnest, homely, genuine people.

2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not <b>talk</b> <b>much,</b> being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction.

2500|$|Said {{argued in}} Culture and Imperalism {{that there were}} {{widespread}} ideas about Britain {{and the rest of}} the world in the 19th century that tended to glorify [...] "our world" [...] by devaluing the world of others. Said maintained that the contradiction between the warm, humanist world of Britain that was best exampled by Austen's idealised, bucolic English countryside vs. the brutal and rapacious exploitation of other people's countries in the British Empire depended upon a certain geographical understanding of morality with one what would be impermissible at home being all too permissible in the colonies of the British Empire. Said stated that this spatial way of understanding the world turns up with [...] "inert regularity" [...] in British literature from the 16th century onward, and formed a [...] "vital part" [...] of British national identity. Said argued that Austen embraced and promoted this spatial understanding of the world in Mansfield Park. Said argued that the play that is about to put on, which Price disapproves of, reflected the opposition between the [...] "indecent" [...] culture of France as represented by the lewd play vs. the [...] "decent" [...] culture of English domesticity as represented by Price. Likewise, Said argued that without the paterfamilias of Sir Thomas to provide the order necessary to underpin English domesticity, his family falls apart with the young people engaging in flirtatious behavior and the indecent play Lover's Vows about to put on. Said maintained that when Sir Thomas returned from his plantation in Antigua, which he tended to as a good master, he likewise restores order to Mansfield Park. Said argued that the reader is left with no doubt that Sir Thomas was also able to restore order at his slave plantation in Antigua just as he did upon his return to Mansfield Park, and that Austen created the character of Sir Thomas as the archetypal good master just as competent at running his estate in the English countryside as was in exploiting his slaves in the West Indies. Said admitted Austen does not <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> in the book about the slave plantation owed by Sir Thomas, but he contended that Austen wrote in such a manner she expected the reader to [...] "assume" [...] that the Bertram family's wealth was due to profits produced by the sugar worked by their African slaves, which he argued reflected Austen's assumption that this was just the natural order of the world. Said wrote that Austen was [...] "not a neutral" [...] writer, but instead a [...] "politically charged" [...] writer who depicted the [...] "world out there" [...] as a both a place of no great significance and a place that provided the wealth that supported the Bertram family, which he argued reflected a thoroughly imperialistic understanding of the world. Said stated that because the Bertrams owned their wealth to a slave plantation in Antigua, that Austen wrote the novel to glorify those families who become so rich in the 18th and early 19th centuries thanks to their investments in the sugar plantations of the West Indies.|$|E
2500|$|The street {{violence}} in Germany had largely ceased {{in the period}} 13 April-15 June 1932 when the SA and SS had been banned, {{and it was only}} after Papen lifted the ban that street violence returned with a vengeance. [...] Riots resulted on the streets of Berlin, as a total of 461 battles between Communists and the SA took place, leading to 82 deaths on both sides. Papen took no responsibility for lifting the ban and blamed the Social Democratic Prussian minister-president Otto Braun for the violence, claiming with no real proof that Braun had ordered the Prussian police to support the Communists against the Nazis. Papen had been looking for a reason to take over Prussia right from the beginning of his Chancellorship, and only held back because he lacked a convincing excuse. On 11 July 1932, {{with the exception of the}} Labour Minister Schäffer, the entire cabinet voted to depose the Braun government provided that Papen could find a believable excuse, and on the next day, the Interior Minister Baron Wilhlem von Gayl found that excuse, reporting he heard a rumor that the Social Democrats and Communists were planning a merger. The fact that Social Democrats and Communists were engaging in street battles, which might suggest that this rumor was just that, was disregarded and Papen promptly visited Hindenburg at his estate at Neudeck to ask for and receive a decree allowing the Reich government to take over the Prussian government. In this meeting with Hindenburg, Papen did not <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> about the alleged plans for a SPD-KPD merger, instead saying that the decree was necessary because the Reich and Prussian governments should be headed by the same man as was the case in Imperial Germany. [...] On 20 July 1932, Papen launched a coup against the centre-left coalition government of Prussia, which was dominated by the Social Democrats (the so-called Preußenschlag). The use of the police apparatus in the Prussian [...] "coup" [...] on 20 July 1932 is described by historians Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle as [...] "the decisive breach on the path towards the Third Reich." [...] Berlin was put on military shutdown and Papen sent men to arrest the Prussian authorities, whom he accused with no evidence of being in league with the Communists. Hereafter, Papen declared himself commissioner of Prussia by way of an emergency decree which he elicited from Hindenburg, further weakening the democracy of the Weimar Republic. In Germany, the Reich government made laws, but the Länder governments were responsible for enforcing them as the Reich government had no police force of its own. When Prussia was ruled by Social Democrats, Paragraph 175, which made homosexuality illegal was not enforced as the SPD had long argued for the legalization of homosexuality. With the Preußenschlag, and with Papen serving as the Commissioner for Prussia, this changed as Papen ordered the Prussian police to start enforcing Paragraph 175 and to crack down on [...] "sexual immorality" [...] by banning nude bathing, pornography, and nude dancing together with a law ordering women not to wear [...] "suggestive" [...] clothing in public, though Papen did not ban soliciting by prostitutes as he had promised to. Despite his very acrimonious split with the Zentrum, Papen still had hopes of having the Zentrum support his government, and cracking on [...] "sexual immorality" [...] in Prussia offered a possible way of winning support from the Catholic church, which supported the Zentrum. But the same time, Papen wished to trade a full scale crackdown in exchange for the Zentrum supporting his government, which explained why Papen's crackdown was not as harsh as many Catholic conservatives would have liked. Papen had hopes in the summer of 1932 of attracting support in the Reichstag of a [...] "black-brown" [...] coalition of the Zentrum and the NSDAP.|$|E
