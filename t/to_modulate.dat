5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order <b>to</b> <b>modulate</b> their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E

5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza – Trio. The {{first part}} of the scherzo proper cadences not in the tonic or dominant, but in the subdominant. The second, B part, {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>modulate</b> by ascending fourths, until it reaches the key of D-flat major. In this key, a new theme is presented, emphasizing the local subdominant (G-flat major, a further fourth upward) – first in the major mode, then in the minor, with an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor. This harmonic excursion eventually leads, through A major and a B diminished triad, back to the tonic and the opening section. The trio is in binary form and in B-flat minor, the first presentation of the tonic minor in the sonata.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—-This paper {{presents}} an optimal feed-back switching concept for the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) based damping controllers for damping low frequency oscillations {{in a power}} system. Detailed investigations {{have been carried out}} considering switching between two optimal damping controllers; one with respect <b>to</b> <b>modulating</b> index of shunt inverter and another with respect <b>to</b> <b>modulating</b> index of series inverter. The proposed UPFC switching model presented here is tested on the modified SMIB linearised Phillips-Heffron model of a power system installed with UPFC using MATLAB/SIMULINK ® platform. The investigations reveal that the proposed optimal feed-back switching control between UPFC damping controllers and provides moderately better performance with respect to settling time for both individual controllers as well as coordinated damping controller...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{model of}} small-amplitude {{traveling}} waves arising in a supercritical Hopfbifurcation, that are coupled to a slowly varying, real field. The field is advected by the waves and, in turn, affects their stability via a coupling to the growth rate. In the absence of dispersion we identify two distinct shortwave instabilities. One instability induces a phase slip of the waves and a corresponding reduction of the winding number, while the other leads <b>to</b> a <b>modulated</b> wave structure. The bifurcation <b>to</b> <b>modulated</b> waves can be either forward or backward, {{in the latter case}} permitting the existence of localized, traveling pulses which are bistable with the basic, conductive state. ...|$|R
