25|$|Worker bees provide {{another example}} of the use of {{marginal}} value theorem in modeling optimal foraging behavior. Bees forage from flower to flower collecting nectar <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> to the hive. While this situation {{is similar to that of}} the starlings, both the constraints and currency are actually different for the bees.|$|E
25|$|A {{success by}} ship of line {{fighting}} alone against {{a squadron of}} well armed frigates was not common during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. For example, in the Action of 8 March 1795, the 74-gun HMS Berwick was captured in just 15 minutes by the French frigate Alceste, supported by the frigates Minerve and Vestale. As a reward for his victory, Captain Alonso de Torres y Guerra was given the encomienda of Corral de Caracuel in the Order of Alcántara, which included, asides of the title of knight, an income of 15.800 reales. On the other hand, Galloway's career wasn't damaged by {{the result of the}} action, and he was chosen by Admiral Jervis <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> to England news of the victory of St Vincent.|$|E

25|$|Problems also arose between Diogo and the Portuguese {{settlers}} at Sao Tome {{known as}} Tomistas. According to a treaty between Kongo and Portugal, the former were only to trade within the latter's realm for slaves. That meant the Portuguese were {{restricted to the}} slaves offered by King Diogo or those he authorized to sell slaves. Every year the Tomistas would come with 12 to 15 ships <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> between 400 and 700 slaves (5,000–10,000 slaves a year). This {{was not enough to}} take advantage of Kongo's ever-growing supply of slaves thanks to wars on its eastern frontier. The captains would try to overload their cargos, resulting in revolts. However, the factor that actually broke the deal was the Tomista habit of sailing upriver to the Malebo Pool to purchase slaves from BaTeke traders who were increasingly taken with European goods over the nzimbu shells the manikongo offered them. Enraged by this breach of contract, King Diogo broke off relations in 1555 and expelled 70 or so Portuguese living in his realm (many of whom had lived {{there for a long time}} with African wives and mixed-race children).|$|E
2500|$|During 1839 {{he served}} with the West Indies Squadron and the {{receiving}} ship in Baltimore, before being assigned to the Pacific Squadron in 1843. [...] He became Fleet Surgeon with the Pacific Squadron in 1844 and, upon completion of his tour in 1846, was about {{to return to the}} United States when relations between that country and Mexico became decidedly strained. The commander of the Navy's Pacific Squadron, Commodore John D. Sloat, consequently entrusted certain dispatches to Wood <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> to the United States with him. Wood volunteered to travel through Mexico and report upon conditions there. Accompanied by the American consul from Mazatlán, Mexico, the former fleet surgeon commenced his journey across Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1944, {{physician}} researcher Claude Barlow ingested over 200 schistosome worms <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> to the United States from Egypt {{to study}} whether domestic snails could become infected and introduce the disease into the United States. Attempts to send infected snails, the intermediate host, by mail had been unsuccessful. He refused treatment, despite being desperately ill by December, {{so as not}} to lose the eggs for further study. He finally passed 4,630 eggs in his semen and 200 eggs in [...] his urine. The U.S. government decided not to use the eggs, so his self-sacrifice was to no avail. It was November 1945 before he finally cleared all the parasites, after treatment with tartar emetic.|$|E

2500|$|Constraints are {{hypotheses}} about the limitations that {{are placed on}} an animal. These limitations can be due to features of the environment or the physiology of the animal and could limit their foraging efficiency. [...] The time that it takes for the forager to travel from the nesting site to the foraging site {{is an example of}} a constraint. [...] The maximum number of food items a forager is able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> to its nesting site is another example of a constraint. [...] There could also be cognitive constraints on animals, such as limits to learning and memory. The more constraints that one is able to identify in a given system, the more predictive power the model will have.|$|E
2500|$|... “Many of the Indians {{would want}} to go out and buy {{trinkets}} and things <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>back</b> home, such as nice blankets and shawls. [...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
