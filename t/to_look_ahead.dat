25|$|At first, the Giants tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> and recover. They {{vowed to}} win their {{remaining}} four games and protect McVay's job. Instead, the collapse continued. The next week, the Giants blew a 10-point lead over the 3–9 Buffalo Bills late in the game, giving up 27 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to lose 41–17. They would win only one more game the rest of the season, finishing with a 6–10 record. The sweep by Philadelphia ensured the Giants would finish last in the division (tied with the Cardinals) for the third straight season, extending their rut and further angering fans.|$|E

He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – it looks to me like he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
2500|$|American existential {{psychologist}} Rollo May {{hypothesized that}} [...] "depression is {{the inability to}} construct a future".

2500|$|One of {{the first}} books with the word [...] "jazz" [...] in the title {{originates}} from Germany. In his book Jazz - Eine Musikalische Zeitfrage (Jazz - A Musical Issue) of 1927, Paul Bernhard relates the term Jazz to a specific dance. When dancer Josephine Baker visited Berlin in 1925, she found it dazzling. [...] "The city had a jewel-like sparkle," [...] she said, [...] "the vast cafés reminded me of ocean liners powered by the rhythms of their orchestras. There was music everywhere." [...] Eager <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> after the crushing defeat of World War I, Weimar Germany embraced the modernism that swept through Europe and was crazy about jazz. In the dancing mania of the post-war period, there were not only modern dances such as the tango and foxtrot, but in 1920 also the Shimmy and in 1922 the Two-step. In 1925 the Charleston dominated the dance halls. Even when under great criticism Bernhard Sekles initiated the first academic jazz studies anywhere at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt in 1928 - the first courses in the United States were started in the mid-1940s. The director of the jazz department was Mátyás Seiber. The jazz studies were closed by The Nazis in 1933.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{endeavours}} at Keelung were {{of great}} interest to another predatory power in the region, the Empire of Japan. [...] In 1874 the Japanese had sent a punitive expedition to southern Taiwan, following the murder of shipwrecked Japanese sailors by Taiwanese aborigines, and Japanese expansionists already had their eye on Taiwan as a future Japanese colony. Following the failure of the Gapsin Coup in Korea in December 1884, Japan began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> to an eventual showdown with China. [...] Although France and Japan never became formal allies during the Sino-French War (despite Chinese fears of such a possibility), Japan's naval and military leaders observed the performance of Admiral Courbet's squadron and Colonel Duchesne's Formosa expeditionary corps with keen professional interest. [...] The Japanese captain Tōgō Heihachirō, the future commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy, [...] visited Keelung during the war aboard the corvette Amagi and was briefed by French officers on the tactics the French were using against the Chinese. Togo's guide was the young French engineering captain Joseph Joffre, who had been sent to Keelung to lay out the new French forts after Duchesne's March victory. [...] Commander-in-chief of the French Army {{at the start of the}} First World War and victor of the crucial Battle of the Marne in 1914, Joffre would end his military career as a Marshal of France.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows how}} moral {{decisions}} {{can be drawn}} computationally by using ACORDA, a working implementation of prospective logic programming. ACORDA is employed to model moral dilemmas, as they are able <b>to</b> prospectively <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> at the consequences of hypothetical moral judgments. With this knowledge of consequences, moral rules are then used to decide the appropriate moral judgments. The whole moral reasoning is achieved via a priori constraints and a posteriori preferences on abductive stable models, two features available in ACORDA. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new regular expression matching method by using Dual Glushkov NFA. Dual Glushkov NFA is the variant of Glushkov NFA, {{and it has}} the strong property that all the outgoing edges to a state of it have the same labels. We propose the new matching method <b>Look</b> <b>Ahead</b> Matching that suited to Dual Glushkov NFA structure. This method executes NFA simulation with reading two input characters at the one time. We use information of next character to narrow down the active states on NFA simulation. It costs additional working memory <b>to</b> apply <b>Look</b> <b>Ahead</b> Matching <b>to</b> ordinal Thompson NFA. However, we can use this method with no additional memory space if use it with Dual Glushkov NFA. Experiments also indicate that the combination of Dual Glushkov NFA with <b>Look</b> <b>Ahead</b> Matching outperforms the other methods on NFAs converted from practical regular expressions. ...|$|R
