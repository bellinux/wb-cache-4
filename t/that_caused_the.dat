5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E

5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|Details about Kentuckians first animal {{transport}} journey are not known, but her second trip began 14 March 1918 when she sailed from Newport News, Virginia, with 848 animals for Saint-Nazaire, where she unloaded {{all but the}} four animals that had died or were destroyed during the voyage. On 24 April, during a convoy crossing in Army service, Naval Armed Guardsmen on Kentuckian sighted a torpedo heading towards the second ship behind her in the column. Opening fire on the torpedo, the gun crew claimed the hit <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> torpedo to explode short of its intended target. Further details of Kentuckians Army service are not available.|$|E

5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{started the}} season with {{consecutive}} wins, rising {{to the top of}} the table by early October. After a home loss in the Clássico, the team's results became poorer, with three draws and two losses <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> team to drop to third place by New Year. Benfica continued to slip in January, losing the Lisbon derby and twice dropping to fifth place. A home win against Sporting CP for the Portuguese Cup had an apparent positive effect on the players; their best period all season came as they regained first place and opened a six-point lead over the team in second place.|$|E
5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form {{a center}} of the provincial administration. The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> desertification of the region.|$|E

Fort Stikine only had a short career, and was destroyed in an explosion at Bombay, India, in April 1944 <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> loss of a further thirteen ships.|$|E

This event, coupled with the October 1990 engine incident, led to a 50+ day grounding of the B-1Bs not on nuclear alert status. The problem was eventually traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, and all B-1Bs were equipped with modified engines.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal.

Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished {{on the ground}} because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered.

5|$|One night, a cargo {{aircraft}} {{from the}} kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal humanoid bioweapons <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and seems poised to attack the villagers, but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides {{it away from the}} village.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting on {{the twentieth}} anniversary of its release in a {{retrospective}} article on Salon.com, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that Batman {{has had on}} the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; {{the primacy of the}} MPAA PG-13 as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.|$|E

5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
5|$|The first {{silkworm}} diseases {{began to}} appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> disease to decline.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Century Falls {{is driven}} by a legend that no {{children}} {{had been born in}} the eponymous village for more than forty years. The lead protagonist, Tess Hunter (Catherine Sanderson), is an overweight teenager who moves to the village with her mother {{at the beginning of the}} serial. She quickly befriends the psychic Ben Naismith (Simon Fenton) and his twin sister Carey (Emma Jane Lavin). The three teenagers examine the waterfall that gave Ben his powers and the disaster <b>that</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> legendary infertility. The serial climaxes in a confrontation between Tess and the deity Century, who is attempting to fuse with Tess's unborn sister.|$|E
