The two Kuwaitis killed {{during the course of}} the hijacking were buried at a ceremony attended by over 2,000 people. On April 25, Time Magazine reported that many Middle East leaders had condemned the hijacking because it had shifted focus away from <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against Israel that had commenced a few months earlier. It also frustrated already tense relations between Iran and the PLO. The Kuwait government believed the hijacking to be the work of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shi'ite group based in Lebanon.|$|E

5000|$|Israel built {{a barrier}} and a 200-300 meter buffer {{zone in the}} Philadelphi route during <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> of <b>the</b> early 2000s. It was made mostly of {{corrugated}} sheet metal, with stretches of concrete topped with barbed wire. The construction of the buffer zone required the demolition of entire blocks of houses at the main entrance to Rafah's central thoroughfare, {{as well as in}} the Al-Brazil block, Tel al Sultan and [...] "Block O".|$|R
25|$|The Israeli {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> was harsh. The IDF killed many Palestinians {{at the beginning}} of the Intifada, the majority killed during demonstrations and riots. Since initially a high proportion of those killed were civilians and youths, Yitzhak Rabin adopted a fallback policy of 'might, power and beatings'. Israel used mass arrests of Palestinians, engaged in collective punishments like closing down West Bank universities for most years of the uprising, and West Bank schools for a total of 12 months. Round-the-clock curfews were imposed over 1600 times in just the first year. Communities were cut off from supplies of water, electricity and fuel. At any one time, 25,000 Palestinians would be confined to their homes. Trees were uprooted on Palestinians farms, and agricultural produce blocked from being sold. In the first year over 1,000 Palestinians had their homes either demolished or blocked up. Settlers also engaged in private attacks on Palestinians. Palestinian refusals to pay taxes were met with confiscations of property and licenses, new car taxes, and heavy fines for any family whose members had been identified as stone-throwers.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Second Intifada, <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against Israeli {{occupation}} that began in 2000, the show became dominated by the conflict, which Qandil generally regarded as a campaign of Israeli aggression. He frequently broadcast the Israeli military's actions during the Intifada and called for viewers to support the uprising and boycott Israeli products. Qandil responded to a query regarding his extensive coverage of the Intifada by saying, [...] "How are news shows expected to react to events such as the Intifada? Are we supposed to keep silent?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Other views {{maintain}} that Lebanese anger against perceived Syrian hegemony had been simmering for decades, and {{the assassination of}} a popular leader was the spark {{that gave birth to}} the movement, independently of foreign and regional developments. Lebanese opposition leader and newspaper columnist Samir Kassir, for example, wrote that [...] "democracy is spreading in the region not because of George Bush but despite him." [...] He gave far more credit to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> as an inspiration to Lebanese activists.|$|E

[...] (...) translates into English as [...] "uprising." [...] Its root is an Arabic word meaning [...] "the shaking off." [...] It {{has been used in}} the meaning of [...] "insurrection" [...] in various Arab countries. The Egyptian riots of 1977 were called the [...] "bread intifada". The term {{refers to a}} revolt against the Israeli occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Territories.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Wieland, two more German soldiers, {{who had been}} formerly raised in Palestinian Templer communities, {{were assigned to the}} unit.

2500|$|As the {{political}} center of Israel's Arab citizens, Nazareth {{is the scene}} of annual rallies held by the community including Land Day since March 1975 and May Day. There are also frequent demonstrations {{in support of the}} Palestinian cause. During the First Intifada (1987–1993), May Day marchers vocally supported <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising.</b> On 22 December 1987, riots broke out during a strike held in solidarity with the Intifada. On 24 January 1988, a mass demonstration attracted between 20,000–50,000 participants from Nazareth and other Arab towns. On 13 May, during a football match in Nahariya, a riot broke out between Arab and Jewish fans, resulting in a Jewish man being stabbed and 54 people, mostly Arabs, being arrested. A rally in Nazareth on 19 May followed, in which thousands of Arabs protested against [...] "racist attacks" [...] against the Arab fans and discriminatory policies against Arabs in general.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his theory}} about the [...] "youth bulge", Heinsohn argues that an excess in {{especially}} young adult male population predictably leads to social unrest, war and terrorism, as the [...] "third and fourth sons" [...] that find no prestigious positions in their existing societies rationalize their impetus to compete by religion or political ideology. Heinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers (such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic {{changes of the}} environment) and most genocides can be readily explained {{as a result of}} a built up youth bulge, including European colonialism, 20th century Fascism, and ongoing conflicts such as that in Darfur, <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> in 1987-1993 and 2000 to present, and terrorism.|$|R
25|$|He rose to {{national}} prominence for {{his pursuit of}} civil rights of Muslim-Americans and raising awareness of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> plight. Al-Arian criticized the peace process led by Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and advocated support for <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> against Israeli occupation during the 1980s and early 1990s. On October 20, 1988, Al-Arian established the Islamic Concern Project, which included a committee devoted to raising charity for Palestine. In 1990–91, his continued involvement in promoting dialogue between the West and Middle East {{led to the creation}} of World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), which served as a think tank that promoted public policy initiatives. WISE and University of South Florida formally agreed to cooperate on March 11, 1992. WISE published journals, supported graduate student education, and held seminars between American and Middle Eastern scholars.|$|R

25|$|Israel's use of {{comprehensive}} closures decreased {{over the next}} few years.
