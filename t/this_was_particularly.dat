5|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, and that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> evident in its use of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who had {{initially}} remained in the ruins of the city after the uprising later made attempts to leave. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> true of Robinsons who had stayed, not of their own choice, but due to unfavorable circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> important for navies which required a long range at cruising speeds—and hence for the US Navy, which was planning {{in the event}} of war to cruise across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E

5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|Like Jarmusch's {{previous}} films, Mystery Train {{enjoyed a}} warm reception from critics. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> evident at Cannes, where {{the film was}} nominated for the Palme d'Or and Jarmusch was commended for the festival's Best Artistic Achievement. It was nominated in six categories at the 1989 Independent Spirit Awards: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Jim Jarmusch), Best Director (Jim Jarmusch), Best Cinematography (Robby Müller), Best Actress (Youki Kudoh), and Best Supporting Actor (Steve Buscemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins).|$|E
5|$|Miller was Australia's top-scorer {{during the}} Victory Tests {{and came to}} the fore with his fast bowling. Miller was {{acclaimed}} for his free-spirited and adventurous batting, which he attributed to the triviality of sport in comparison to war. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> exhibited in his 185 from 165 minutes for Dominions against England. It was through his involvement in wartime cricket that Miller met many of his future international colleagues, such as England's Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Len Hutton.|$|E

5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Division's {{structure}} changed considerably during World War II, with units being detached or {{attached to}} meet operational needs. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> so during early 1942 and late 1943. Below is a divisional {{order of battle}} that is indicative of its generic make up. In addition to those listed, during 1942–1943, the 14th, 21st, 25th and 30th Brigades were also attached, albeit temporarily for varying periods.|$|E
5|$|Another {{institution}} key to unifying the German states, the Zollverein, {{helped to}} create a larger sense of economic unification. Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister Hans, Count von Bülow, as a Prussian customs union in 1818, the Zollverein linked the many Prussian and Hohenzollern territories. Over the ensuing thirty years (and more) other German states joined. The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers among the German states, especially improving the transport of raw materials and finished goods, making it both easier to move goods across territorial borders and less costly to buy, transport, and sell raw materials. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> important for the emerging industrial centers, {{most of which were}} located in the Rhineland, the Saar, and the Ruhr valleys.|$|E

5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} to be working successfully and North Vietnam had not decided to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. The glowing press coverage of the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that undermined the official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on the Buddhist crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under the mistaken {{impression}} that {{the situation in the}} 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. However, the effect of the rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to the situation in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E

5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
