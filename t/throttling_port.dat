5000|$|Net bias, the term, {{was first}} coined by Rob Frieden, a {{professor}} at Penn State University. Similar terms include data discrimination and network management. Net bias occurs when an ISP drops packets or denies access based on artificially induced conditions such as simulating congestion or blocking packets, {{despite the fact that}} ample capacity exists to carry traffic. Examples (models) of net bias include tiered service (specialized service), metering, bandwidth <b>throttling,</b> and <b>port</b> blocking. These forms of net bias are achieved by technical advancements of the Internet Protocol.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} the first {{investigation}} {{on the effect of}} flow control methods on the part load performance in a spark ignition engine. For comparison of the methods, two control devices, <b>port</b> <b>throttling</b> and masking, were applied to a conventional engine without any design change of the intake port. Steady flow evaluation shows that steady flow rates per unit opening area and swirl ratio are very low compared with the <b>port</b> <b>throttling</b> and saturated from mid-stage valve lift, however, swirl increases slightly as the lift is higher in case of 1 / 4 masking control. In the part load performance, the effect of simple <b>port</b> <b>throttling</b> on lean misfire limit expansion is limited and insufficient; on the other hand a masking improves the limit considerably without any port modification for increasing swirl. Also the results show that the intake flow control improves the combustion with following two mechanisms: stratification induced by the combination of the flow pattern and the fuel injection timing attribute to ignition ability and the intensified flow ensure fast burn. In addition fuel consumption reduces under the flow controls and the reduction rate is different according to the operation conditions and control methods. At the Stoichiometric and/or low speed and low load the throttling method is more advantageous; however vice versa at lean and high load condition. Finally, the throttling is more efficient for HC reduction than masking, on the other side the NOx emissions increase under the masking and decreas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To expand lean misfire {{limit and}} improve {{combustion}} stability, {{the effects of}} port masking were estimated to secure basic data for applying the mechanism to SI engine instead of asymmetrical <b>port</b> and <b>port</b> <b>throttling</b> devises. For this purpose, various shapes and ratios of masking plates were mounted between port and manifold. The masking effects were evaluated by mixture response test under various load and speed conditions. The results showed that lean misfire limits were expended and fast combustion was observed for all masking shapes and ratios, especially, the effect of diagonal 1 / 4 masking was remarkable. In conclusion, the port masking method could be easily applied to engine without redesign of port for improving part load performance...|$|R

40|$|Fluid {{compressibility}} has a {{major influence}} on the efficiency of switch-mode hydraulic circuits due to the release of energy stored in fluid compression during each switching cycle and the increased flow rate through the high-speed valve during transition events. Multiple models existing in the literature for fluid bulk modulus, the inverse of the compressibility, are reviewed and compared with regards to their applicability to a switch-mode circuit. In this work, a computational model is constructed of the primary energy losses in a generic switch-mode hydraulic circuit with emphasis on losses created by fluid compressibility. The model is used in a computational experiment where the system pressure, switched volume, and fraction of air entrained in the hydraulic fluid are varied through multiple levels. The computational experiments resulted in switch-mode circuit volumetric efficiencies that ranged from 51 % to 95 %. The dominant energy loss is due to <b>throttling</b> through the <b>ports</b> of the high-speed valve during valve transition events. The throttling losses increase with the fraction of entrained air and the volume of fluid experiencing pressure fluctuations, with a smaller overall influence seen {{as a result of the}} system pressure. The results of the computational experiment indicate that to achieve high efficiency in switch-mode hydraulic circuits, it is critical to minimize both the entrained air in the hydraulic fluid and the fluid volume between the high-speed valve and the pump, motor, or actuator. These computational results are compare...|$|R
40|$|Radical {{combustion}} is {{a critical}} condition behind control. In two stroke engine, a condition of radical combustion could be achieved through control of the trapped exhaust gases at a certain condition, might include, the engine load, speed, concentration of the unburned hydrocarbons, their temperature and other operational parameters. An earlier work was conducted towards {{the achievement of the}} radical combustion. The mechanism was made to throttle the opening of the exhaust port at a range of 1 % to 8 % [1]. However, several difficulties were faced, mainly with the control mechanism of throttling. In addition there is a complexity in identifying the critical conditions at which the radical combustion could be achieved. In this paper, a new strategy was used to control the exhaust <b>port</b> <b>throttling</b> in a way to manage the amount of exhaust gases trapped and avoiding the drawbacks of the throttling mechanism in the earlier work. Three trial plates were used, one-sixth closed, one-third closed and half closed to throttle the exhaust gases leaving the combustion chamber. Results reveal the possibility of achieving radical combustion, when using the one-sixth closed plate under relatively higher load. Therefore, partial trapping of the exhaust gases should be carried, through the restriction of the opening of the exhaust port not to exceed 15 % of the port exit area. However, it is more interesting, that throttling of the exhaust gases of the two stroke engine have clear influence on the quality and stability of the combustion and hence its direct effect on the fuel consumption and the rate of pollutants expelled to the environment...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of fuel injection in spark ignition engines have aroused {{new interest in}} two stroke cycle engines. The performance of such engines is very much affected by the dynamic behaviour of the fresh air introduced and the exhaust leaving the cylinder through ports, receivers and silencers. The present investigation has as its aim the clarification and establishment of trends {{in the performance of}} two stroke engines with particular reference to crank case scavenged engines. The basic relations governing the flow of air and gas through the whole system are investigated one by one and their interdependence is established. The investigation covers: pulsations in the cylinder, accelerations in the ducts, effect of variable port area, effect of <b>throttling</b> in the <b>ports.</b> The basic differential equation for free oscillation of the exhaust gas in the system comprising receiver, exhaust pipe, and silencer is set up and a method is developed which allows calculation of an equivalent length for the system. With this equivalent length, the natural frequency of the system can be calculated. An experimental investigation is presented which was carried out on a single cylinder compression ignition engine with crank case scavenging. The volumetric efficiency of the engine was determined as a function of exhaust system configuration at various brake mean effective pressures and at constant engine speed. The pressure in the exhaust near the port was measured (by means of a quartz and crystal pickup) as a function of crank angle. The results are presented in the form of plots of volumetric efficiencies as function of brake mean effective pressure for various configurations and as photographic records of pressure as a function of crank angle. It is concluded that a simple frequency analysis is insufficient for the determination of the exhaust behaviour. Criteria for good exhaust systems are established. The trends predicted in the theoretical analysis of the report are, in general, well verified. The need for further investigation is indicated and an outline of research is presented...|$|R
5000|$|The Cologne raid of 1/2 February 1943 nearly brought Mahaddie's RAF {{career to}} an end. After {{releasing}} his target marking flares, the cloud cover {{that had been}} providing some protection that night broke up, and his aircraft was hit with flak. At nearly the same time his aircraft was attacked by a Ju 88 night-fighter, which raked its fuselage with cannon fire. Mahaddie initiated a diving turn to starboard, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft slipping into a steep, violent diving turn. Altitude was being lost at an alarming rate, and he realized he had lost lateral control of the aircraft. As they were diving under full power, Mahaddie made a grab for the throttle controls to pull them back. Fortunately, he only reached the two <b>port</b> <b>throttles,</b> and as he brought back power on them the aircraft leveled off. The instrument panel had been wrecked, the rear turret was put out of action and the Stirling's intercom system was knocked out. The mid-upper gunner, wireless operator and bomb aimer were all injured, most of the compasses and navigational equipment were destroyed and the aileron controls were severed. According to gunner Bob Pointer, [...] "the skipper was fighting with the aircraft. Having had the aileron controls badly mangled by the cannon shells he could only fly the aircraft by varying the power of the engines." [...] He attempted to regain the altitude lost and came up through a cloud bank to realize they were headed east instead of west. By manipulating the power on the four engines he was able to lurch the aircraft back toward home. Flight Sergeant Stewart treated the wounds of the three injured crew members. Meanwhile, using star sightings and the plane's astro-compass, navigator [...] "Tommy" [...] Thompson was able to provide Mahaddie with a bearing back to base, if he could control the aircraft. Reaching the wing root with a flashlight and some wire, the flight engineer was able to jury rig a splice over the airloin wires, giving Mahaddie partial control of [...] "C" [...] Charlie, and he set course for home." [...] However, their troubles were not over. Half way to the coast a second night fighter located the aircraft and closed, but Mahaddie was able to evade and shake him off, though the splicing of the ailerons did not hold up to his maneuvers and for a time he was limited to controlling direction with the throttle controls again. The next morning revealed the aircraft had taken 174 cannon shell hits. Said Mahaddie, [...] "We went out flying C-Charlie, and came back flying C-Colander." [...] Shells had past through through the cockpit either side of Mahaddie's seat, making a mess of the instruments. One round punched through the armour plate below the pilot, but the parachute Mahaddie was using as a seat cushion absorbed the rest of the rounds energy, leaving a mark on the pilot's buttock [...] "no bigger than the size of a sixpence".
