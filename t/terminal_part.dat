5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the <b>terminal</b> <b>part</b> of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E

25|$|Secretory {{cells are}} found in a group, or acinus (plural, acini). Each acinus {{is located at the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>part</b> of the gland {{connected}} to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: serous, mucoserous and mucous.|$|E
2500|$|Tsawwassen [...] ( [...] ; from sc̓əwaθən, meaning [...] "facing the ocean") is a suburban, mostly {{residential}} community {{located on}} a peninsula in the southwestern corner of the Municipality of Delta, British Columbia, Canada. Tsawwassen provides the only road access to the community of Point Roberts, Washington via 56th Street. It is also the location of Tsawwassen Ferry <b>Terminal,</b> <b>part</b> of the BC Ferries, built in 1959 to provide foot-passenger and motor vehicle access from the Lower Mainland to {{the southern part of}} Vancouver Island and the Southern Gulf Islands. Because Tsawwassen touches a shallow bank, the ferry terminal is built at the southwestern end of a [...] long causeway that juts out into the Strait of Georgia. The ferry dock and causeway are part of Highway 17. Boundary Bay Airport, a major training hub for local and international pilots which also provides local airplane and helicopter service, is located ten minutes away. The Roberts Bank Superport is also located near Tsawwassen.|$|E

60|$|Cats, when terrified, {{stand at}} full height, and arch their backs in a {{well-known}} and ridiculous fashion. They spit, hiss, or growl. The hair {{over the whole}} body, and especially on the tail, becomes erect. In the instances observed by me the basal part of the tail was held upright, the <b>terminal</b> <b>part</b> being thrown on one side; but sometimes the tail (see fig. 15) is only a little raised, and is bent almost from the base to one side. The ears are drawn back, and the teeth exposed. When two kittens are playing together, the one often thus tries to frighten the other. From {{what we have seen}} in former chapters, all the above points of expression are intelligible, except the extreme arching of the back. I am inclined to believe that, {{in the same manner as}} many birds, whilst they ruffle their feathers, spread out their wings and tail, to make themselves look as big as possible, so cats stand upright at their full height, arch their backs, often raise the basal part of the tail, and erect their hair, for the same purpose. The lynx, when attacked, is said to arch its back, and is thus figured by Brehm. But the keepers in the Zoological Gardens have never seen any tendency to this action in the larger feline animals, such as tigers, lions, &c.; and these have little cause to be afraid of any other animal.|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} the {{alimentary}} canal I have met with an account of only a single rudiment, namely the vermiform appendage of the cæcum. The cæcum is a branch or diverticulum of the intestine, ending in a cul-de-sac, and it is extremely long {{in many of the}} lower vegetable-feeding mammals. In the marsupial koala it is actually more than thrice as long as the whole body.[36] It is sometimes produced into a long gradually-tapering point, and is sometimes constricted in parts. It appears as if, in consequence of changed diet or habits, the cæcum had become much shortened in various animals, the vermiform appendage being left as a rudiment of the shortened part. That this appendage is a rudiment, we may infer from its small size, and from the evidence which Prof. Canestrini[37] has collected of its variability in man. It is occasionally quite absent, or again is largely developed. The passage is sometimes completely closed for half or two-thirds of its length, with the <b>terminal</b> <b>part</b> consisting of a flattened solid expansion. In the orang this appendage is long and convoluted: in man it arises {{from the end of the}} short cæcum, and is commonly from four to five inches in length, being only about the third of an inch in diameter. Not only is it useless, but it is sometimes the cause of death, of which fact I have lately heard two instances: this is due to small hard bodies, such as seeds, entering the passage and causing inflammation.[38] ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{bioinformatics}} {{analysis of}} disorder content of proteins from the DisProt database has been performed {{with respect to}} position of disordered residues. Each protein chain was divided into three parts: N- and C- <b>terminal</b> <b>parts</b> with each containing 30 amino acid (AA) residues and the middle region containing the remaining AA residues. The results show that in <b>terminal</b> <b>parts,</b> the percentage of disordered AA residues is {{higher than that of}} all AA residues (17 % of disordered AA residues and 11 % of all). We analyzed the percentage of disorder for each of 20 AA residues in the three parts of proteins with respect to their hydropathy and molecular weight. For each AA, the percentage of disorder in the middle part is lower than that in <b>terminal</b> <b>parts</b> which is comparable at the two termini. A new scale of AAs has been introduced according to their disorder content in the middle part of proteins: CIFWMLYHRNVTAGQDSKEP. All big hydrophobic AAs are less frequently disordered, while almost all small hydrophilic AAs are more frequently disordered. The results obtained may be useful for construction and improving predictors for protein disorder...|$|R
6000|$|We are, however, here {{concerned}} {{only with}} sexual selection. This {{depends on the}} advantage which certain individuals have over others {{of the same sex}} and species solely in respect of reproduction. When, as in the cases above mentioned, the two sexes differ in structure in relation to different habits of life, they have no doubt been modified through natural selection, and by inheritance limited to one and the same sex. So again the primary sexual organs, and those for nourishing or protecting the young, come under the same influence; for those individuals which generated or nourished their offspring best, would leave, ceteris paribus, the greatest number to inherit their superiority; whilst those which generated or nourished their offspring badly, would leave but few to inherit their weaker powers. As the male has to find the female, he requires organs of sense and locomotion, but if these organs are necessary for the other purposes of life, as is generally the case, they will have been developed through natural selection. When the male has found the female, he sometimes absolutely requires prehensile organs to hold her; thus Dr. Wallace informs me that the males of certain moths cannot unite with the females if their tarsi or feet are broken. The males of many oceanic crustaceans, when adult, have their legs and antennae modified in an extraordinary manner for the prehension of the female; hence we may suspect that it is because these animals are washed about by the waves of the open sea, that they require these organs in order to propagate their kind, and if so, their development has been the result of ordinary or natural selection. Some animals extremely low in the scale have been modified for this same purpose; thus the males of certain parasitic worms, when fully grown, have the lower surface of the <b>terminal</b> <b>part</b> of their bodies roughened like a rasp, and with this they coil round and permanently hold the females. (4. M. Perrier advances this case ('Revue Scientifique,' Feb. 1, 1873, p. 865) as one fatal to the belief in sexual election, inasmuch as he supposes that I attribute all the differences between the sexes to sexual selection. This distinguished naturalist, therefore, like so many other Frenchmen, has not taken the trouble to understand even the first principles of sexual selection. An English naturalist insists that the claspers of certain male animals could not have been developed through the choice of the female! Had I not met with this remark, I should not have thought it possible for any one to have read this chapter and to have imagined that I maintain that the choice of the female {{had anything to do with}} the development of the prehensile organs in the male.) ...|$|E
