On each trial, <b>the</b> <b>display</b> <b>elements</b> (two discs) appeared either separated or connected (either via a white line or side by side) and subjects reported whether they observed element motion or group motion at various ISIs. Although it was hypothesized that element motion would be eliminated in the connected condition, subjects observed element motion at short ISIs {{in the form of a}} three dimensional illusion in which one element appeared to rotate out in front of (or behind) the other.

40|$|Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) {{chemically}} doped with poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is {{a material}} system commonly {{used as a}} conductive and transparent coating in several important electronic applications.

40|$|We {{discuss and}} compare three {{algorithms}} for generating holograms: simple rounding, Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion dithering, and mixed region amplitude freedom (MRAF). The methods are optimised for producing large arrays of tightly focused optical tweezers for trapping particles. The algorithms are compared {{in terms of}} their speed, efficiency, and accuracy, for periodic arrangements of traps; an arrangement of particular interest in the field of quantum computing.

40|$|Abstract. Four {{experiments}} {{demonstrate that}} lines indicating path of movement can generate rotational percepts in a multistable motion display that usually produces only horizontal or vertical motion percepts. The {{properties of the}} path-of-movement lines are predicted by a neuralnetwork theory of visual perception. Experimental results validate the theory's predictions by demonstrating that movement of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> <b>elements</b> seems to follow an increasing luminance gradient in lines but not bars, and that illusory contours have similar effects. Experimental results also demonstrate that, in a choice between movement along lines drawn parallel or orthogonal to possible motion paths, observers more often see movement along the lines parallel to the motion path. These results suggest modifications to current computational and neurophysiological theories of motion perception. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined cross-trial positional priming (V. Maljkovic & K. Nakayama, 1994, 1996, 2000) {{in visual}} pop-out search. Experiment 1 used regularly arranged target and distractor displays, as in previous studies. Reaction times were expedited when the target appeared at a previous target location (facilitation relative to neutral baseline) and slowed when the target appeared at a previous distractor location (inhibition). In contrast to facilitation, inhibition emerged only after extended practice. Experiment 2 revealed reduced facilitatory and no inhibitory priming when the elements' spatial arrangement was made irregular, indicating that positional—in particular, inhibitory—priming critically {{depends on the}} configuration of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> <b>elements</b> across sequences of trials.
