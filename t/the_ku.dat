5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} the revival of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to {{be as high as}} 300 people. By the late 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E

2500|$|Unless already geminated, <b>the</b> {{syllable}} <b>ku</b> may {{be reduced}} to a moraic obstruent, resulting in a following geminate consonant. For example, ぬくなか nukunaka may be pronounced as ぬっなか nunnaka. This same reduction occurred in the participle form, where <b>the</b> syllable <b>ku</b> in -kusee (standard -kute) was turned into a geminate -ssee. Alternatively, <b>the</b> syllable <b>ku</b> can be reduced to just -u, conforming with the basic adverbial ending. For example, んまくなか nmakunaka becomes んもなか nmonaka [...] "it doesn't taste good".|$|R
50|$|The {{outright}} title gave Kansas the {{top seed}} for the Big 12 Tournament and a bye for the preliminary rounds of play.

Finally, in <b>the</b> title game, <b>KU</b> defeated Texas 88-84 in overtime {{to win the}} Big 12 Tournament. They pulled off an even bigger comeback than in the regular-season meeting, coming from down 22 to win.

5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

5|$|Leslie was a Confederate sympathizer {{during the}} Civil War, but began {{to adopt a}} more {{progressive}} position during his gubernatorial campaign against Harlan. Though he opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the testimony of blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been Charley Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie, {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching. Charley was an Okemah {{real-estate}} agent, district court clerk, Democratic politician, Freemason and owner of the town's first automobile. According to Joe Klein, he was also a member of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan in the 1920s. There is no documentary evidence that Charley was a Klansman.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|Tupper's role as {{the founder}} of the first {{university}} dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition.

In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E

5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan).|$|E
5|$|Hiram Wesley Evans (September 26, 1881– September 14, 1966) was Imperial Wizard of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan, an American white {{supremacist}} group, from 1922 to 1939. A native of Alabama, Evans attended Vanderbilt University {{and became a}} dentist. He operated a small, moderately successful practice in Texas until 1920, {{when he joined the}} Klan's Dallas chapter. He quickly rose through the ranks and was part of a group that ousted William Joseph Simmons from the position of Imperial Wizard, the national leader, in November 1922. Evans succeeded him and sought to transform the group into a political power.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} the film The Birth of a Nation by D. W.

5|$|In 1964, three {{civil rights}} workers (two white and one black) who {{organize}} a voter registry for African Americans in Jessup County, Mississippi go missing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Anderson—a former Mississippi sheriff—and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices. By the turn of the 20th century, they had become so notorious that anti-lynching laws were passed and in one incident the governor called out the militia to protect a prisoner. When the white caps showed up to lynch him, the militia opened fire, killing one and wounding eleven. Vigilante activity decreased following the incident, and remained low until the rise of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Lewisville {{is served}} mainly by media from the Dallas area, {{but a number}} of niche {{publications}} focus on local news. The Lewisville Enterprise merged with The Lewisville Leader in 1962. The paper's publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of Lewisville Independent School District, for which he received many anonymous threats from members of <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> Klux Klan. Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the Leader, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of Neighborsgo, a weekly section of The Dallas Morning News, as the city's official newspaper of record.|$|E
