5|$|Unlike most James Bond films {{featuring}} {{various locations}} around the world, almost the entire film is set in one country and several minutes are devoted to an elaborate Japanese wedding.

Toho Studios provided soundstages, personnel, and the female Japanese stars to the producers.|$|E
50|$|The student {{interaction}} {{in the message}} boards added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions.</b> Since <b>the</b> students were not in a classroom, {{this was the way}} they could share ideas and questions, and challenge others to see things from another point of view. Because the class was also global, the students brought with them their own cultural differences, which also added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} a book <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He {{notes that}} the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a {{dramatic}} gesture at the Sejm, {{is said to have}} bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in {{a dramatic}} attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} errors may {{be traced back to}} Roger Cotes's Opera Miscellanea (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir {{prepared}} by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of errors of observation. The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable, and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors. Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve.|$|E

25|$|Huysmans' {{work was}} known for his {{idiosyncratic}} use of the French language, extensive vocabulary, detailed and sensuous descriptions, and biting, satirical wit. It also displays an encyclopaedic erudition, ranging from the catalogue of decadent Latin authors in À rebours <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of the iconography of Christian architecture in La cathédrale. Huysmans expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep pessimism. This had led him first to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Later he returned to the Catholic Church, as noted in his Durtal novels.|$|E
25|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> above, clitics {{must be able}} to be {{distinguished}} from words. There {{have been a number of}} linguistic tests proposed to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories in the sense that they share certain properties with them. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.|$|E

In science subjects, this meant a conversion from the cgs system to SI, in geography from the imperial system to SI while in mathematics it meant discarding the teaching of mixed unit arithmetic, a topic that took up {{a significant part of the}} time allocated in primary schools to arithmetic/mathematics and 7% of total time allocated to all subjects.|$|E
