He trapped <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> Coxon two balls {{later in the}} same over for a duck, leaving England at 133/6. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit {{him in front of}} the stumps and {{prompted}} a loud lbw appeal, and did the same thing to the next ball. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. In the meantime, Dollery had continued to bat effectively, watching the ball closely onto his bat, and scoring three leg side boundaries from Johnston's bowling. Eight runs after Coxon's dismissal, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker without scoring later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Johnston had Bedser caught by Hassett for nine before Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall for four.|$|E
25|$|Just how {{significant}} the strike's implications were becomes apparent {{when considering the}} miner's place in Communist myth-making: he represented an “archetypal proletarian”, a “new man” whose symbolic aura was conferred by his Stakhanovite determination. The idea of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> particularly caught on in areas dominated by a single industry, like the Jiu Valley, where the working masses could easily be controlled by the party. The uneducated miners, drawn largely from poor rural or socially disadvantaged layers of society, believed in the Communist ideology and discourse, which rang true to them, and awaited {{the arrival of a}} classless society. The miserable conditions in which they actually lived did not match the propaganda, and the disillusioned miners responded forcefully. After the strike, Ceaușescu took to posing as an “honorary miner” or as a national leader flanked by Securitate members dressed up as miners. He had been genuinely shocked that the representatives par excellence of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> had unexpectedly revolted against the system that had so carefully crafted them. The image of the model miner had come crashing down, and for that reason the strikers were terrorized—they had destroyed a myth that had served not only them and other “new men”, but also Ceaușescu himself.|$|E

Gombau quickly changed the club's fortunes, getting his second win in round 10 against the Central Coast Mariners, with a 4–0 result. The team {{continued}} this form to finish sixth on the table after the 27 home-and-away games, which let them into the finals by two points.

25|$|The club {{came out}} of {{administration}} in 2003–04 under a new board of fan-ownership. However, Horton left in February 2004, unwilling to accept the financial cutbacks imposed by the new board. Replaced by former player Martin Foyle, his team's 17th and 13th-place finishes were followed by a poor start to the 2007–08 season, which resulted in his dismissal in November 2007. He had put together a successful strike partnership in Leon Constantine and Akpo Sodje, but many other signings did {{not live up to}} expectation. Succeeded by promising non-league manager Lee Sinnott, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> proved unable to prevent the club from sliding into League Two after a 23rd-place finish, and the team crashed out to Chasetown (an 8th tiered club) in the FA Cup. Sinnott was sacked in September 2008 after a poor start to 2008–09. Dean Glover took over as caretaker manager {{for the second time in}} twelve months, and was quickly appointed as manager on a permanent basis. Glover failed to win over the supporters, and the 2008–09 season finished with the club in 18th place in League Two. His contract terminated in May 2009, Micky Adams became the new manager.|$|E

40|$|The later {{seventeenth century}} was {{an era of}} {{unprecedented}} social mobility in {{the upper reaches of}} Muscovite society. Prior to the reign of Aleksei Mikhailovich, the boyar duma had been the preserve of a small set of pedigreed families. Aleksei, however, altered the traditional duma recruitment policy in the 1650 s and began to promote undistinguished 2 ̆ 2 <b>new</b> <b>men</b> 2 ̆ 2 into the duma. Despite the claims of some historians, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>men</b> were not radicals. It is true that many of them had {{made their way to the}} top by virtue of their service and skill, and not due to any hereditary right to elite ranks or offices. They were the beneficiaries of a very mild drift toward meritocratic appointment. But <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>men</b> did not necessarily share the principles standing behind the policy that brought them into the heights of Muscovite society. They had been born and bred in a society that took for granted the existence of a class of men who were the natural born leaders of <b>the</b> realm. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>men</b> recognized that though they were among the elite, they were not of it in a genealogical sense. It likely never occurred to them to alter the basic principles of the old status system. The parvenus wanted to become members of the hereditary elite, not to destroy it. Evidence of widespread genealogical falsification by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>men</b> is prima facie indication of this desire and the mentality that stood behind it...|$|R

500|$|For Tasmania, Gervase Du Croz and Marshall {{opened the}} batting to the fast roundarm bowling of Lister and Hamilton. They batted for an hour—described {{in the press}} as {{displaying}} [...] "brilliant steady batting"—without being dismissed, at which point, with the score at 25, a lunch break was taken. After the interval, they maintained their partnership for another 30 minutes before Antill, who had replaced Hamilton in the bowling attack, bowled Du Croz; he had scored 27 in 93 minutes and the partnership was worth 40 runs. William Field, who replaced Du Croz, was bowled by the first ball he faced. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>man,</b> George Maddox, scored a single from his first ball; Marshall was then caught at point, having batted 105 minutes for 13 runs. Antill had taken three wickets in four balls. Maddox was bowled by Antill after scoring one, then Hamilton bowled George Gibson for eight. Walter Westbrook, the next man in, survived for forty minutes but struggled to score, only managing three scoring shots in that time before Antill bowled him. Wickets fell steadily: Charles Arthur, bowled by Antill, scored one; John Tabart, bowled by Hamilton, scored two, and Henty was bowled by Antill for a duck. The last batsman, McDowall, batted effectively to score ten runs before he was caught by Antill at mid-on off Hamilton's bowling. Vincent Giblin remained not out, having batted {{for a half hour}} for seven runs. The Van Diemen's Land innings ended for 104, a lead of 22 over Port Phillip, after 160 minutes and 32 overs. Antill had taken seven wickets for 33 runs while Hamilton took three for 24. Before the match, the Tasmanians had been expected to struggle against the overarm attack of the Victorians, and Antill had performed effectively; yet the Tasmanians were helped by a large total of 24 extras (which included 11 byes and eight no-balls).|$|E

2500|$|The two Natures {{and the two}} Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Man,</b> {{a member}} of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in {{contrast}} with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. King Lear is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king's rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare's understanding of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Man</b> is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism – the energy, the emancipation, the courage – which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. [...] "He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. But he makes an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society. It is not right to assert the kind of man Edmund would erect to this supremacy." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} they had been separated, the duo had already broken several records. When Dravid hit an {{exemplary}} cover-drive to bring up the 250 of the partnership, they became the first batting pair to put on two stands excess of 250 against Australia. After their stand ended, however, Dravid felt least unperturbed and forged a partnership of 59 with the young Parthiv Patel, who played well for a composed 31, which consisted of three successive fours off MacGill, but the partnership ended when Patel drove Katich to Ponting. At 447/6, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> Ajit Agarkar came in and Dravid stitched a stand of 22 with him and then Agarkar too departed at 469/7. Finally, with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> Kumble, Dravid added 8 runs before the play was finished for the day. He finished tantalizingly at 199 not out, an innings which was built slowly, yet steadily. This was his first test hundred in Australia, and this was an innings which [...] "laughed at the face of that innuendo". Sambit Bal, noted cricinfo author argued that Dravid could have completed any easy double hundred had he not refused easy runs in order to shield the lower-order batsmen. Bal also described Dravid's batting as being [...] "picture perfect. It describes balance, poise and symmetry". Laxman and Dravid had frustrated Australia so much on that day, that their partnership seemed to be an encore of that 376 that had put on together at Kolkata in 2000–01. Laxman had scored a double century back then, and Dravid seemed to be on the cusp of another one. in fact, when Ricky Ponting was asked {{at the end of the}} previous day whether Dravid and Laxman's partnership brought back memories of Kolkata 2000–01, Ponting was reported to have said, [...] "I didn't want to think of that." ...|$|E
