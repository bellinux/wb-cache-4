40|$|Abstract: In {{assessing}} <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> {{of information}} communication technologies (ICTs) on tourism businesses, this study adopted {{a case study}} blueprint, with a questionnaire survey being used to collect data from selected tourism businesses. The respondents rated ICT <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> tourism on a 5 - point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The results show that <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> hotels were perceived as ranging from 4. 07 (improved company image) to 4. 92 (increased market share), whereas <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> bed and breakfast establishments were perceived as ranging from 3. 88 (improved company image) to 4. 86 (speeded up service). <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> travel agents were perceived as ranging from 4. 48 (improved service quality) to 4. 94 (improved service quality), whereas <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> tour guides were perceived as ranging from 4. 58 (improved company image) to 4. 81 (heightened customer satisfaction levels). <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> backpackers were perceived as ranging from 3. 78 (improved company image) to 4. 75 (increased market share). Since ICT was perceived to <b>impact</b> relatively little <b>on</b> company image improvement, tourism businesses should use such technology to improve company image. The uniqueness of this article lies in it revealing <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> of ICT <b>on</b> tourism business from an African country perspective...|$|R

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled and by <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> their food resources. A 2007 {{report to the}} California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E

5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms.

The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E

A number of articles have been written in China about this issue.

5|$|Cyclone Zoe {{severely}} impacted {{the islands}} of the Solomon island chain, particularly {{the islands of}} Tikopia and Anuta. In Anuta, agricultural activities were disrupted. Various fruit trees and crops, especially in gardens on the island's hills, were destroyed by high winds and heavy rain. In addition, communications with other islands were disrupted. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Tikopia was much greater; agricultural productivity on the island {{was said to have}} been wiped out. Fruit trees were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at least two years after Zoe's impact. Topsoil was left dry by the cyclone, preventing any immediate replacement of lost crops.|$|E

40|$|The {{fast growing}} {{literature}} <b>on</b> economic <b>impacts</b> {{of climate change}} is inclined to assessing <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> agricultural production and productivity and on human health. <b>The</b> economic <b>impacts</b> of climate change however, go beyond these sectors.

It is at-tempted to summarize the ways through which the climate change can affect non-agriculture economic activities.

5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008.

Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{estimate}} in monetary terms <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ecosystem {{services of a}} 2 D seismic Project in the rainforest region of Peru. Economic valuation of <b>the</b> environmental <b>impacts</b> of land use projects {{is an important part}} of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) in Peru. EIAs are used to establish a social and environmental base line, identify impacts, and establish mitigation measures and compensations. Legislation is very broad in regard to the goals and ways to conduct economic valuations. Assessments are not comparable and/or use overly general secondary data. In this context, this study proposes a way to both standardize and improve the economic valuation methods for EIAs in Peru by using local data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ecosystem services and on the economy of the people that depend on them and accounting for <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> after <b>the</b> project has ended. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> of <b>the</b> project <b>on</b> the carbon capture and storage are calculated through valuation of carbon stocks, deforestation carbon flux loss, and reforestation carbon flux. <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economic activities that depend on ecosystem services are als...|$|R
