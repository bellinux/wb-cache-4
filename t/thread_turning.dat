40|$|Noteworthy {{results have}} been {{obtained}} in the turning and drilling of hardened high-strength steels using tungsten carbide based cutting tools. In a finish turning process, it was seen that surface roughness and tool flank wear followed very different trends against cutting time. The suggested explanation for this behaviour is that the profile cut into the workpiece surface {{is determined by the}} tool's cutting edge profile. It is shown that the profile appearing on the cut surface changes rapidly over time, so the profile of the tool cutting edge should also be changing rapidly. Workpiece material adhered onto the cutting tool, which is also known as a built-up edge, is a phenomenon which could explain the observations made. In terms of tool damage modes, workpiece material adhesion is believed to have contributed to tool wear in examples provided from finish turning, <b>thread</b> <b>turning</b> and drilling.

30|$|As {{a result}} of {{continuous}} changes in business environment and uncertainty of demand and production processes, manufacturing industries are having to develop and evolve rapidly. Therefore, in the future, the production system should be flexible and {{able to respond to}} factor alterations quickly. The system should create high quality products, support small production volumes and meet all needs of customer specifications. Modern production systems consist of high-performance technology and equipment, which increase production capacity. However, at the same time, the system operations become more sophisticated and complex. Manufacturing processes involve inputs from various departments including management, production, finance, marketing, and engineering etc. Hence, the created production system should be able to allow relevant departments to influence the manufacturing operations conveniently and effectively. The production system should consist of the following three components of inputs including manpower, raw materials, machines, energy, money and information; processes including preparation of materials, assembly of all components into various shapes as well as packaging for distribution and outputs including products or outputs in the form of goods or services. Turning is a basic process that is commonly used in various industries. The operation involves rotating the work-piece while moving a cutting tool linearly toward the work-piece to improve the work-piece. Turning can cut or decrease the size of a work-piece by removing external surface with a cutting tool positioned vertically to its rotating axis. Types of turning methods include facing, straight turning, <b>thread</b> <b>turning,</b> boring, necking and parting. Lathe machines can be classified as manually controlled or automatically controlled.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the roller and screw threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> section outline. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in mechanical engineering development is the constant improvement of load capacity of machines, mechanisms, units and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also true for today’s most prospective planetary rollerscrew mechanisms (PRSM) converting motion from rotary to linear type. The problem of PRSM load capacity improvement deserves more attention, because these mechanisms have very high performance characteristics, which leads to problems in the choice of support devices for these mechanisms. However, for many mechanical engineering industries it is important to decrease the PRSMs weight and dimensions, or to improve their reliability and durability. This has led to finding the reserves for improving the PRSM load capacity by decreasing the <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> profile angle, α, of PRSM threaded parts, as compared to α = 90 ° in traditional mechanisms. When PRSM calculation methods were developed, it was decided to use α = 90 ° for transforming the mechanism parts into a physical model and a design pattern. It allowed us to reduce the PRSM designing to well-known roller bearing designing based on very extensive experimental data. Proposed PRSM designs do not contradict to accepted physical models and design patterns – they just have different basic characteristics of PRSM, i. e. static and dynamic load ratings. Proposed PRSM designs with a <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> profile angle α= 70 ° on their parts allow to increase the load capacity by 15 %, as compared to traditional PRSMs, which have threaded parts with a <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> profile angle α = 90 °. There are two factors, which can improve the PRSM load capacity. The first one is the decrease of normal force between mating <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> of a screw and a roller with the same operational axial force. The second one is the increase of the radius of the shaped profile of a roller <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> resulting in the expansion of the contact area pattern between the mating <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> of a screw and a roller. The first factor dominates here. For implementing the proposed PRSM designs into production, one has to explore additionally the effect of α-angle on linkage parameters, process requirements and specific features of the initial contact between the mating <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> of a screw and a roller. </p...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{composite}} materials (CM) {{are widely used}} in the aerospace technology and mechanical engineering where the key parameters characterizing structural components and articles are related to their weight characteristics {{as well as their}} performance under high temperatures. For the experimental investigation of composite-based threaded items, the rod-based 3 Dreinforced carbon-carbon composite material (CCCM) was chosen. The subject of the research was the metric thread. The test samples were cut of the aforesaid material along one of the reinforcement direction. The following thread sizes were analyzed: М 24 × 1. 5; М 24 × 2; М 24 × 3. Dependence of the thread strength on the number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> was determined within the range of 1 to 10 <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> for М 24 × 2 thread size. The remaining test samples were used to obtain the relationship between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. The obtained dependence of the thread load bearing capacity on the number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> showed the following: a) An increment in the thread load bearing capacity decreases with increasing number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> However, this effect is less pronounced than that observed for the metal ‘screw/nut’ pair. b) With the CCCM material under study, it proved to be impossible to test configurations having only 1 or 2 <b>thread</b> <b>turns.</b> c) The wide confidence range (CR) of the failure load {{can be explained by the}} fact that the material under study features an apparent structural heterogeneity, with a different probability of hitting a unit cell of the matrix and filler of the material. Nevertheless, the confidence range is stable, thus indicating indirectly the possibility of using this test method for further study of composite-based threaded items. There is an explicit correlation between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. Increase in the thread strength with increasing thread pitch depends on the relationship between the pitch size and the characteristic size of the unit cell of the material. The test research has shown that it is possible to make CCCM-based screw joints designed for operation under high temperatures as an alternative for metal screw joints, provided that the key parameters such as the thread profile, pitch, diameter and the number of <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> are properly chosen. </p...|$|R
40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of thread mills, instead of taps, roll burnishers, dies and <b>thread</b> <b>turning</b> tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of thread mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of thread mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of thread mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of thread mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of thread mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of thread mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of thread mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter of the cut thread. The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated. The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool. Approximation of the specified parameters is carried out and mathematical dependences, which can be further used to calculate and choose the starting values of design data in designing the abovementioned constructions of thread mills. </p...|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction of included angle of ERSM threaded parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact of the conjugated <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change of included angle of threaded parts of the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which roller thread profile has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack of sharp <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> on the screw, rollers and nut; <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> of roller with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> of roller with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features. Concurrently, possible wear out of threaded surfaces of ERSM parts is taken into account. </p...|$|R

40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts <b>thread</b> <b>turn</b> flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts <b>thread</b> <b>turns</b> load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive <b>threaded</b> parts <b>turns</b> loading irregularity is strong...|$|R

A characteristic {{feature of the}} theoretical approach of {{the paper is the}} use of a RSM rod model with two elastic contact layers (the first layer is composed of screw-rollers, the second – of nut-rollers). A threaded mating of each elastic layer is considered as a connection with continuous turns, which is closest to the truth and consistent to classical approaches. A similar approach was applied for the ball-and-screw mechanisms with a member point contact. Thus, differential analytical closed-form equations may be used to solve this task. Based on the initial equation of compatibility of strains, axial offsets of contact layer points and the sum of screw, roller and nut turn deflections are calculated; then, load distribution across the turns may be determined. Load distribution depends both on the RSM geometry (pitch, profile angle, entry number, and thread diameter), material of threaded elements, manufacturing accuracy, and on mating friction forces. With the dependencies of load distribution across the turns of zero-clearance RSMs obtained, we have determined that maximum load is imposed on the outermost turns, which corresponds to classical solutions proposed by N.
