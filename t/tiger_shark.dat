5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E

5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, the <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E

40|$|Sharks are apex predators that {{structure}} marine communities through predation. Despite {{a large number}} of studies in other areas, especially the Pacific, there are no quantitative data on the diet of <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks,</b> Galeocerdo cuvier, in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Diet was assessed from 169 <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks</b> by life stage, area, and environmental factors. Fifteen prey groups were identified, with teleosts, molluscs, birds, cephalopods, and reptiles being the predominant prey categories. There was an ontogenetic shift in diet, prey size and diversity with an increase in shark size. Molluscs were most common in smaller sharks, while teleosts and reptiles became more important in the diet of larger sharks. Dietary overlap was significant by area (Gulf of Mexico vs Atlantic Ocean) and among all life stages except for young-of-the-year and adult <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks.</b> Overall, <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks</b> in the northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico had diverse diets and exhibited ontogenetic shifts, similar to Pacific <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks.</b> Juvenile <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks</b> also demonstrated selective feeding by targeting gastropod foot over ingesting the entire animal. The results of this study can contribute to developing ecosystem models for <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks</b> in an area where their diet has been studied very little...|$|R

5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>shark</b> {{teeth are}} unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{high risk}} of predation, {{dolphins}} often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten.

5|$|The <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> is {{captured}} and killed for its fins, flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries.

5|$|The <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> is an apex {{predator}} and has {{a reputation}} for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} <b>tiger</b> <b>shark</b> (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to report a {{scavenging}} event, involving the consumption of a nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, by <b>tiger</b> <b>sharks,</b> Galeocerdo cuvier, at Fernando de Noronha archipelago, Brazil.
