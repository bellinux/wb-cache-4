40|$|Deaerating {{condenser}} boosts combined-cycle plant efficiency Studies show {{savings in}} equipment and plant {{space and the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>deaerate</b> large quantities of makeup water using only turbine exhaust steam in a new system BY R. E. ATHEY AND E. SPENCER, GRAHAM MANUFACTURING CO. Anew system of steam condenser dissolved oxygen control hasfound favor in the combined-cycle cogeneration market. Savings in equipment, a reduction in building size (and plant height), and the ability <b>to</b> <b>deaerate</b> large quantities of makeup water using only turbine exhaust steam are the reasons. In earlier days, no condenser manufacturer guaranteed condensate oxygen levels of 7 parts per billion (ppb) under any operating condition. Instead, guarantees were limited to Heat Exchange Institute (HEI) standards. HEI standards promise 0. 005 cc/I (7 ppb) dissolved oxygen (DO) in the condensate only if (1) the air leakage is reduced to a frac...|$|E

30|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{experiments were}} performed using a EG&G PAR 283 A Potentiostat/Galvanostat {{controlled by the}} M 270 software. A conventional two-compartment three-electrode cell was used for all electrochemical measurements studied. The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl electrode. GC electrode was employed as the working electrode with a diameter of 3  mm and platinum foil utilized as the counter electrode. The GC electrode was twice physically polished with alumina powder (200 – 300  mesh) followed by sonication in double distilled water for 3  min. All electrochemical experiments were conducted in deaerated 0.1  M PB at pH  7.2. Agilent 8453 diode array UV–visible spectrophotometer was used for UV–Vis measurements. The surface characterization was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images with a HITACHI MODEL S- 3000 H scanning electron microscope. All the electrochemical experiments were performed with freshly prepared solutions, and nitrogen was used <b>to</b> <b>deaerate</b> all experimental solutions.|$|E
40|$|When exposed <b>to</b> <b>deaerated</b> high purity water, Alloy X- 750 is {{susceptible}} to both high temperature (> 249 C) intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) and intergranular low temperature ( 249 C), hydrogen deaerated water increases the hydrogen concentration in strong hydrogen trap states and degrades {{the resistance of the}} material to low temperature fracture. These findings are consistent with a hydrogen embrittlement based mechanism of LTF where intergranular fracture occurs ahead of a crack tip and is exacerbated by phosphorus segregation to grain boundaries and grain boundary hydrogen trap states...|$|R

The {{evolution of the}} chemical composition ofthe passive film during exposure <b>to</b> <b>deaerated</b> 0. 1 N KC 1 was analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

The breakdown potential is also found to increase with higher concentrations of Mo in the alloy. These results correlate with an increase in the amount ofMo i...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies is to obtain a better {{understanding}} of the role which antimony plays in accelerating the corrosion of tin. Tin-antimony alloys were prepared by electrodeposition a d the corrosion rates were determined from polarization data obtained in deaerated 0. 33 M citric acid. The corrosion rates were linearly related to the antimony concen-tration in the alloy and were described by the following equation Corrosion rate in A/m s = 0. 0003 + 0. 000079 X whereX is the antimony concentration i the tin in ppm. A mechanism is proposed in which small amounts of antimony oxide on a tin substrate catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction. Nitrite additions <b>to</b> <b>deaerated</b> citric acid greatly acceler-ated the corrosion rate of unalloyed tin. The effects of nitrite were described by the following equation Corrosion rate in A/m 2 - 0. 0003 + 0. 021 Y where Y is the nitrite concentration i the citric acid in ppm. The nitrite results and the great effect of antimony on the corrosion rate were attributed to the fact that a partially oxidized surface serves as a remarkably effective catalyst for the hydrogen evo]ution reaction tin. Seweral isolated studies have shown that antimony has an accelerating effect on the corrosion of tin i...|$|R
30|$|The surface {{morphology}} was studied by {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) (JEOL JSM- 5900; JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and field-emission scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis tool (field emission scanning electron microscopy, FESEM; Hitachi S- 7400, Japan). Information about the phase and crystallinity was obtained by using Rigaku x-ray diffractometer (XRD; Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα (λ[*]=[*] 1.540  Å) radiation over Bragg angle ranging from 10 ° to 90 °. High-resolution image and {{selected area electron diffraction}} patterns were obtained with transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL JEM- 2010, JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 200  kV equipped with EDX analysis. The Raman spectra were measured using Nanofinder 30 spectrometer (Tokyo Inst. Co., Machida-shi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a He/Ne (λ[*]=[*] 633  nm laser) and the scattering peaks were calibrated with a reference peak from a Si wafer (520  cm- 1). Raman spectra were recorded under a microscope with a[*]×[*] 40 objective in range of 0 – 1, 600  cm- 1 and 3  mW of power at the sample. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a 1  M KOH solution at room temperature. The measurements were performed on a VersaSTAT 4 (USA) electrochemical analyzer and a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. Glassy carbon electrode was used as working electrode. Preparation of the working electrode was carried out by mixing 2  mg of the functional material, 20  μL of Nafion solution (5  wt.%) and 400  μL of isopropanol. The slurry was sonicated for 30  min at room temperature. An amount of 15  μL from the prepared slurry was poured on the active area of the glassy carbon electrode which was then subjected to drying process at 80 °C for 20  min. All potentials were quoted with regard to the Ag/AgCl electrode. High-purity nitrogen gas was used before and during measurements <b>to</b> <b>deaerate</b> the electrolyte in all measurements. Normalization of the current density was achieved based on the surface area of the utilized glassy carbon electrode (0.07  cm 2).|$|E
50|$|Boiler {{feedwater}} is {{an essential}} part of boiler operations. The feed water is put into the steam drum from a feed pump. In the steam drum the feed water is then turned into steam from the heat. After the steam is used it is then dumped to the main condenser. From the condenser it is then pumped <b>to</b> the <b>deaerated</b> feed tank. From this tank it then goes back to the steam drum to complete its cycle. The feed water is never open to the atmosphere. This cycle is known as a closed system or Rankine cycle.|$|R

50|$|Oxygen {{scavenging}} {{chemicals are}} very often added <b>to</b> the <b>deaerated</b> boiler feedwater <b>to</b> remove any last traces of oxygen {{that were not}} removed by the deaerator.The type of chemical added depends on whether the location uses a volatile or non-volatile water treatment program. Most lower pressure systems (<650psi) use a non-volatile program. Most higher pressure systems (>650psi) and all systems where certain highly alloyed materials are present, are now using volatile programs as the old phosphate-based programs are phased out.Volatile programs are further broken down into oxidizing or reducing programs or AVT(R) depending whether the waterside environment requires an oxidizing or reducing environment to {{reduce the incidence of}} flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) which is a highly debated topic within the industry today. FAC-related failures have caused numerous accidents in which significant loss of property and life has occurred.|$|R
30|$|When injured lungs are {{ventilated}} without positive expiratory airway pressure, {{some areas}} of the lung parenchyma are likely <b>to</b> remain <b>deaerated</b> throughout the ventilatory cycle, others remain open, and yet others open as lung volume increases during inspiration and close in expiration. The reopening of closed airways will generate discontinuous adventitious lung sounds starting late in inspiration. If PEEP is able to maintain the airways leading to these areas open, the presence of such sounds should vary with the level of PEEP. Thus lung injury and the application of PEEP to injured lungs would be expected to change the lung sound power spectrum when studied inclusive of crackles, as has indeed been reported [4]. In this study, we sampled the breath sounds at early inspiration before the onset of crackles to exclude all adventitious sounds. The changes we observed therefore are not the result of appearance or disappearance of crackles.|$|R

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization measurements, dielectric measurements and visual observations after salt spray test were performed for monitoring the changes of the organic systems characteristics at predetermined exposure time in the deionized - deaerated water. All four coating systems found providing protection on steel surfaces. The classification of their performance depends mainly on {{the composition of the}} primer, as well as, on the intrinsic characteristics of the other layers. Thus the system consisting of epoxy primer with zinc dust, epoxy high build layer and a two component epoxy paint with iron oxide is the one exhibiting the highest protection efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Copper is {{commonly}} regarded to be immune <b>to</b> corrosion in <b>deaerated</b> deionized electrolytes. The present work shows that, {{in the absence}} of hydrogen, copper will corrode on the order of 1 nm/day in deionized water with an O 2 concentration on the order of, or less than, 1 ppb. While a corrosion rate of this magnitude can normally be neglected, it may be catastrophic for nanoscale copper structures utilized in emerging applications to enhance energy transport at the solid-electrolyte interface, such as in cooling advance electronics. This conclusion is supported by a set of experimental and analytical studies that encompass impedance spectroscopy, slow-scan linear sweep voltammetry, thermodynamic calculations for the environment under study, and kinetic simulations. The studies provide a comprehensive insight on details of the corrosion mechanism for copper in deaerated water...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} resistance of an electroplated (EP) Zn coating whose surface was chemically etched to produce surface defects (pores) is investigated in this work. Impedance and DC polarisation measururements {{were employed to}} study the behaviour of such coating in various corrosive media (NaCl, NaOH and rain water). Four different faradaic relaxation processes were clearly revealed in different NaCl concentrations (from 0. 1 M to 1 M). In the most concentrated solutions at least three relaxation processes at low frequencies (LF) appeared and were related to zinc deposition and dissolution. At lower concentrations and depending on the pH, only one process was observed. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corrosion current (Icorr) were practically stable in the pH range 5 <b>to</b> 10. In <b>deaerated</b> NaCl 0. 1 M, the EIS diagrams showed two time-constants at very close frequencies.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to analyze the {{influence}} of different factors on the oxygen content in the condensate using {{the example of the}} condenser of the steam turbine unit T- 110 / 120 - 130. For the first time, the authors of the article analyze in details how the basic parameters of the condenser's operation (the condenser heat load, the flow and temperature of the cooling water, the air inflow in the condenser, the condition of the heat exchange surface) influence the oxygen content of the condensate. The authors {{come to the conclusion that}} with standard air inflow in the vacuum system, the equilibrium oxygen content, which corresponds to the norms in the condensate at the condenser outlet, is only possible in its operation modes when the steam flow to the condenser is more than 50 % of the nominal flow and cooling water temperatures are equal to or greater than calculated for this type of condenser. The conclusions are confirmed by the experimental material.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} {{a new class of}} aluminum metal matrix composites produced by the direct metal oxi-dation technique, Lanxide AS- 109 TM, was detailed. The composite is 69 % (by volume) SiC reinforcement, 24 % oxidized metal (primarily Al 20,), and 7 % retained aluminum alloy. The corrosion behavior of the SiC/AlO,/Al composite was found to be dependent on NaCl concentration and pH. SiC/A 12 O,/Al was susceptible to pitting of the Al alloy phase at open circuit during exposure <b>to</b> aerated and <b>deaerated</b> 0. 6, 0. 06, and 0. 006 M NaCl solutions. In contrast, exposure to 6 x 10 - 4 M NaCI did not result in pitting at open circuit, and buffered borate solution (no chloride) did not yield pitting at any potential examined. The pitting potential of SiC/AO 2,/Al was estimated to decrease 80 mV per order of magnitude increase in NaCl concentration. Comparison of the composite to a model composite matrix material, Al 6061, revealed that the composite was more susceptible to localized corrosion than the matrix alloy alone which did not pit at open cir-cuit in deaerated 0. 6 M NaCl. Polarization resistance measurements in pH adjusted (pH 1 to 13) 0. 6 M NaCl solutions revealed that the corrosion rate is minimized in neutral solution. Pits were neither confined to regions adjacent to SiC nor AI,O,, suggesting little galvanic effect of the reinforcing phases...|$|R
