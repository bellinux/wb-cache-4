40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to know the effect of learning models on mathematics learning achievement viewed from the student Adversity Quotient (AQ). The learning models compared were the cooperative learning model of the Group Investigation with scientific approach (GI-S), the cooperative learning model of the Think Pair Share with scientific approach (TPS-S), and model of classical learning with scientific approach (K-S). The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{the research}} was a quasi experimental research with the factorial design of 3 x 3. The population were all students of Junior High School in Bantul regency on academic year 2014 / 2015. The samples of the research were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling. The instruments used were mathematics achievement test and questionnaires of AQ. The hypotheses of the research were analyzed by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells at the significance level of. The results of the research are as follows. 1) GI-S gives better mathematics achievements than TPS-S, and both gives better mathematics achievements than K-S. 2) Students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climber have better mathematics achievements than students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> quitter, while students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper have better mathematics achievements than students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> quitter. 3) For GI-S and TPS-S, students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climber and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper have the same mathematics achievements, and students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climber and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper gives better mathematics achievements than students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> quitter.
