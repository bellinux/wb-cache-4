40|$|Background: Vasectomy is a {{safe and}} {{effective}} method to prevent fertility. This method is practical in most regions, {{because it does not}} require complex technology. In spite of this, in some regions of Iran, It has not been approved because of the general believe that vasectomy causes impotence. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional research, 110 persons who were underwent vasectomy in Khorram Abad during 1999 - 2002 time period were studied. Variable parameters including libido, impotence, granuloma, ejaculation problems, joint pain, sleep disorder, chronic pain, surgery regret and surgical failure were considered. The required data were collected by questionnaire and physical exam. Findings: After necessary evaluation of the cases, it was found that 60 % of individuals had not any libido variation and 30 % had increased libido, 85. 5 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have impotence, 85. 5 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have granuloma, 90. 9 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have joint pain, 89. 1 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have ejaculation problems, 90 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have mood disorder, 95. 5 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have sleep disorder and 80 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not have chronic pain in the site of surgery. 97. 3 % of <b>them</b> <b>did</b> not regret of vasectomy. Surgical failure was not seen in any cases. Conclusion: It was found that vasectomy is an effective and successful method to prevent fertility. In most cases it has not side effects such as libido reduction, impotence, granuloma formation, etc. A few cases of side effects may be due to other factors. For better evaluation of long-term effects of vasectomy, a case- control study is necessary...|$|R

5|$|Like the lanthanides, the {{actinides}} form {{a family}} of elements with similar properties. Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The majority of <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in {{addition to}} having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections.|$|E

5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
