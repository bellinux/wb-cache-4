5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation.</b> At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E

25|$|Despite efforts made in {{cleaning}} up uranium sites, significant problems {{stemming from the}} legacy of uranium development still exist today on <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation</b> and in the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

At {{the request of the}} U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in October 2007, and in consultation with <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation,</b> the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Indian Health Service (IHS), developed a coordinated Five-Year Plan to address uranium contamination.

25|$|With a Native American {{population}} of 134,000 in 1990, New Mexico still ranks {{as an important}} center of Native American culture. Both the Navajo and Apache share Athabaskan origin.

With 16 million acres (6,500,000 ha), mostly in neighboring Arizona, the reservation of <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation</b> ranks as {{the largest in the}} United States.

25|$|However, data {{collected}} in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages– early {{evidence of a}} resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people. In 1984, to counteract the language's historical decline, <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation</b> Council decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation.</b> This effort was aided by the fact that, {{largely due to the}} work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages. In 1980 they published a monumental expansion of their work on the language, organized by word (first initial of vowel or consonant) in the pattern of English dictionaries, as requested by Navajo students. The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary also included a 400-page grammar, making it invaluable for both native speakers and students of the language. Particularly in its organization of verbs, it was oriented to Navajo speakers. They expanded this work again in 1987, with several significant additions, and this edition continues to be used as an important text.|$|E
