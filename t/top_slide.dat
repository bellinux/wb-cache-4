2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Panoramas, a more basic series of models was offered, with windows of similar size, but with simpler trim and <b>top</b> <b>sliding</b> vent windows instead of forced air vents. Initially these were built on Bedford and Ford chassis only and named variously as Val, Vam (on the new Bedford VAM chassis) or Embassy IV.

50|$|Open Slide Design. The {{primary role}} of the open-top slide {{was to provide a}} 180° {{ejection}} port. Open <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> virtually eliminated jamming or stovepiping. The slide retention device, which caused the slide and barrel assembly to remain open after the last cartridge had been fired and ejected, allowed the user to load the chamber one cartridge at a time (emergency tactical loading) should the magazine be lost or damaged. The pistols were designed so that the extractor would not be damaged by direct chamber loading. These models operated on the short recoil, delayed locking block system, which yielded a faster cycle time.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or <b>top</b> <b>slide)</b> (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|E

These keys are covered when the phone is closed, but the remaining keys, including the side keys, can be used normally once the keypad is unlocked; such keys are automatically locked after the device is closed to prevent accidental activation when in a purse or pocket.|$|R

50|$|Although {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the preceding Z1 and Z2-class trams they had significant design differences, and were a significant improvement on the Z1 and Z2-class trams. They are fitted with AEG control equipment and Duewag bogies, have an additional door each side (for a total of three rather than two for the Z1 and Z2), drop down (as opposed to <b>top</b> <b>sliding)</b> Beclawat windows and improved headlights. The unreliable flap type destination displays and route number indicators were replaced by rollable plastic film destination displays. They also had much smoother acceleration and braking performance, and improved suspension. The Z3-class build process went smoothly, with few problems, bar a slow delivery of equipment from AEG, and a few minor faults that required remedying after construction.|$|R
5000|$|The Tyer's no. 7 tablet {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a wooden case, on top {{of which is a}} metal slide, a switch plunger, a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: [...] "Line Closed"; [...] "Train Approaching" [...] and [...] "Train on Line". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the bottom slide, and replaced using the <b>top</b> <b>slide.</b> The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|The M1951 {{is a short}} recoil-operated, locked breech pistol with a {{vertically}} falling {{locking piece}} and an open <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> (the locking mechanism design {{was influenced by the}} Walther P38 pistol). The locking piece, located under the barrel, is unlocked by a sliding pin and locked back into battery by a beveled surface on the pistol's frame. The locking piece features two locking lugs that engage appropriate recesses cut into the slide's internal side surfaces. When the pistol is fired, the locking piece, integral with the slide, goes back together with the barrel which is locked to the slide. After a brief period of unrestricted travel of approx. 13 mm the unlocking pin on the rear barrel lug strikes the receiver and stops. As the barrel and slide continue back, the locking piece strikes the stationary plunger and is forced down into recesses in the slide. The barrel comes to rest but the slide continues rearward for a further 50 mm. Upon forward return, the slide picks up the barrel and the locking piece on the barrel lug is lifted up by the receiver cam to lock the barrel to the slide. The spring-loaded extractor is integrated into the slide, and the fixed-type ejector is integral to the pistol's frame. The pistol has a hammer striking mechanism (with an exposed hammer) and a single-action trigger with a disconnector, which enables semi-automatic fire only. A cross-bolt safety mounted on the weapon's frame (beneath the hammer) provides safe operation with a cartridge introduced into the chamber. In the “weapon safe” position (the safety's button pushed in to the left) the slide catch is disabled.|$|E

We adopt a multi-step vertical movement mechanism. Fig.  4 a shows {{an overview of the}} multi-step up–down mechanism. By connecting the five-step slide rails with the chains and the sprockets, all of the slide rails are driven relative to the movement of the top rail. The rotary motion of the servo motor is transformed to linear motion by the ball screw allowing the <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> rail to move {{up and down in the}} vertical direction. This mechanism is based on the extension mechanism of a ladder truck. Fig.  4 b, c show the installation of the multi-step up–down mechanism in the actual process. When the vertical component is contracted, all parts are held above the worker, which prevents collisions with the worker and ensures the worker’s safety.|$|E
40|$|This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} preparation of polymer springs that twist under irradiation with light, {{in a manner that}} mimics how plant tendrils twist and turn under the effect of differential expansion in different sections of the plant. The artificial springs are typically 1 mm in width, 50 μm in thickness and up to 10 mm in length, their length being limited by cell dimensions only. They are made from polymer networks that keep memory of a liquid crystalline order, and in which an azobenzene derivative is introduced covalently as a molecular photo-switch. This liquid crystal polymer is prepared by irradiation of a twist cell filled with a mixture of shape-persistent liquid crystals, liquid crystal having reactive end groups, molecular photo-switches, some chiral dopant and a small amount of photo-initiator. This cell is assembled out of two glass slides separated by a spacer and covered by a thin film of polyimide that was rubbed along the long axis of the cell for the bottom slide, and along the short axis of the cell for the <b>top</b> <b>slide.</b> Once the cell is filled by capillarity, photo-polymerization takes place at 48 ºC and takes approximately 1. 5 h. The product is a photo-responsive liquid crystal polymer network that is characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and tensile strength measurements. The film is post-cured overnight at 60 ºC. Removing the resulting soft polymer film and cutting out the desired spring-like shape takes ~ 45 min. The springs operate at ambient temperature, by mimicking the orthogonal contraction mechanism that is at the origin of plant coiling. They are shape shifting under irradiation with ultraviolet light and can be pre-programmed to either wind or unwind, as encoded in their geometry. Once illumination is stopped, the springs return to their initial shape in ambient light conditions...|$|E

CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2011 (in press). ### INTRODUCTION The *Caenorhabditis elegans* embryo is {{particularly}} amenable to microscopy and embryological studies {{because of its}} short developmental time, transparent shell, and nonpigmented cells. The agar mount described in this protocol is {{an easy way to}} prepare live *C. elegans* embryos for microscopic visualization. The mount slightly embeds the embryo in agar to hold it in place. The mount also slightly compresses the embryo to provide consistent orientation such that every embryo will be positioned with either its right side or its left side facing the objective. Other techniques can result in random orientations that complicate analysis and make identification of individual blastomeres more challenging. ### RELATED INFORMATION Protocols for collection and analysis of four-dimensional (4 D) data can be found in [Acquisition of 4 D DIC Microscopic Data to Determine Cell Contacts in *Caenorhabditis elegans* Embryos]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 a) and [Analysis of 4 D DIC Microscopic Data to Determine Cell Contacts in *Caenorhabditis elegans* Embryos]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 b). An ablation technique for killing individual cells within the embryo (to facilitate the study of cell interactions within the *C. elegans* embryo) is described in [Laser Killing of Blastomeres in *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 c). An alternative method for mounting embryos that involves raising a coverslip on grease “feet” is found in [Suspended Embryo Mount for Imaging *Caenorhabditis elegans* (]([URL] and Isaacson 2010). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Agar (5 %) - *Melt the agar just before use*. - *C. elegans* (gravid hermaphrodites) - M 9 buffer for agar mounts - Valap for agar mounts ### Equipment 1. Aspirator tube assembly (15 -in., for mouth pipette) - Bunsen burner - Coverslips, 18 × 18 -mm (# 1) - Eyelash brush (eyelash glued to end of round toothpick) - Microscope - *For assembling the mount, a standard stereoscope is required for all steps with C. elegans. To identify early embryos (one to four cells), a total zoom of 80 X or greater is recommended. We use Leica S 8 APO microscopes with 10 X eyepieces and Leica MZ 12. 5 microscopes with 16 X eyepieces and 1. 0 X objective lenses*. - Microscope slides, 25 × 75 -mm (1 mm thick) and single depression (3 mm thick) - Paintbrush - Pasteur pipettes (6 -in.) - Pick (platinum wire) - *To make the pick, insert 1 in. of 30 -gauge platinum or 90 % platinum, 10 % iridium wire into a 6 -in Pasteur pipette. Heat it in a flame until the glass melts around the wire. Use flat end hobby pliers or a small tack hammer to flatten the end of the pick*. - Pipettes, calibrated glass (50 -μL) - Razor blade - Syringes (1 cc) with 27 gauge × 1 / 2 -in. needles or scalpel (# 15 curved blade) (see Step 2) - Tape, laboratory label - Tissue (e. g., Kimwipe) ### METHOD *The total time needed for the experienced is 10 - 15 min and for the novice is 30 min*. 1. Use a platinum wire pick to move ~ 5 gravid C. elegans hermaphrodites from a culture dish to a single-depression microscope slide mostly filled with M 9 buffer for agar mounts. - *The number of hermaphrodites needed depends on the number of embryos required at the appropriate stage*. - By holding a syringe with a needle in each hand, place the needles on either side of a hermaphrodite, and draw the flat sides of the tips of the needles across each other to cut the worm in half transversely (Fig. 1 A,B). The embryos will be released from the halves of the hermaphrodite. Use an eyelash brush to carefully prod the halves to expel any remaining embryos. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Isolation of *C. elegans* embryos and preparation for mounting on a slide. (A,B) Gravid hermaphrodites are cut in half with 27 × 1 / 2 -in. needles. (C) At a higher magnification, embryos are sorted and are grouped using an eyelash. (D) Embryos and M 9 buffer are transferred using a mouth pipette. *It is important to cut as close to the vulva as possible to release newly fertilized embryos in the uterus. This step can also be conducted by cutting the worm in half with a # 15 curved blade scalpel*. 3. Sort the embryos using the eyelash brush, and brush them together into a group of ~ 10 embryos (Fig. 1 C). *Embryos will tend to stick slightly to each other when grouped. If you desire a certain stage of embryogenesis, it is at this point that the embryo stage should be assessed and the embryos sorted appropriately. Two-cell stage embryos are the easiest developmental stage to collect*. 4. Make an agar pad: - i. Using laboratory label tape, tape two flat microscope slides parallel and one slide width apart on the laboratory bench. - ii. Place a third slide between the two taped slides (Fig. 2 A). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2. ** Making an agar pad. (A) Three slides are placed on the bench, and the outer two are taped down to the bench. (B) A drop of molten 5 % agar is placed onto the middle slide. A fourth slide is then placed perpendicular to the three original slides. The <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> is compressed over the taped slides. (C) The finished slide is sealed with valap. Using a toothpick to make hash marks in the valap (arrows) aids in finding the grouping of embryos on the compound scope. - iii. Using a 6 -in. Pasteur pipette, place three to four drops of molten 5 % agar onto the middle slide. - iv. Immediately lay the fourth slide perpendicular to the other three slides over the agar, and press it over the taped slides to flatten the agar before it cools (Fig. 2 B). 5. Once the agar has set, use a razor blade to trim excess agar from the edges of the slides. Carefully slide apart the untaped slides, so that the agar pad is left in the center of one slide. *See Troubleshooting*. 6. Prepare a mouth pipette: - i. Heat a glass 50 -μL pipette in the flame of a Bunsen burner. - ii. Once the glass is soft and fluid, remove it from the flame, and quickly pull apart the ends. - iii. Break the two ends apart to create a pipette with a tapered end with a diameter of ~ 40 μm. - iv. Place the pipette in a mouth pipette aspirator. 7. Using the mouth pipette, transfer the grouping of embryos (from Step 3) and ~ 20 μL of M 9 buffer to the corner of the agar pad on the microscope slide (Fig. 1 D). 8. Brush the embryos out of the M 9 buffer {{into the center of the}} slide using the eyelash. Position the embryos in a single layer side by side. 9. Set the edge of a coverslip at the side of the agar pad opposite the M 9 buffer and slowly drop it so that the coverslip lands on the embryos before it contacts the M 9 buffer. Use a tissue to wick excess buffer from the edges of the coverslip, and wick air bubbles from under the coverslip. *See Troubleshooting*. 10. Trim excess agar from the edges of the coverslip using a razor blade. Seal the edges of the coverslip with melted valap for agar mounts using a paintbrush (Fig. 2 C). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The agar pad dries to the slide before it can be used. **[Step 5]** - **Solution**: Make the pad immediately before use. Stereomicroscopes with light sources mounted under the stage have the potential to heat the stage after long use, which can quickly dry agar pads. Using a stereomicroscope with an external bulb or a cool temperature bulb will reduce this problem. - **Problem**: When a coverslip is placed on the slide, all the embryos wash to the edge of the coverslip. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: Too much M 9 buffer is used, and the M 9 buffer is hitting the embryos before the coverslip can land on them and hold them in the agar. Use less M 9 buffer. - **Problem**: The slide has air bubbles under the coverslip. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: Use more M 9 buffer. This will allow M 9 buffer to completely wash under the coverslip. Too much M 9 buffer, however, will cause embryos to wash away (see previous problem). - **Problem**: Embryos fail to develop after mounting. - **Solution**: Consider the following: - i. One-cell embryos are especially vulnerable to mechanical stress and are challenging to mount without killing. If studying a later stage of development, the likelihood of embryos surviving is markedly increased if two-cell or later stage embryos are used to make the mount. - ii. Groupings larger than 15 - 20 embryos often display increased lethality caused by oxygen starvation. By keeping groupings of embryos around 10 embryos, oxygen starvation should not be a problem. ### DISCUSSION Mounting *C. elegans* embryos on agar mounts provides a stable long-term environment for microscopic analysis of development. The slight compression from the coverslip will result in embryos reproducibly positioned with either the left or the right side facing toward the objective lens. During later stages of embryogenesis, embryos turn such that left-side views become dorsal views and right-side views become ventral views. Embryos on agar mounts will survive and will hatch from the eggshell on the mount. Embryos prepared with an agar mount are amenable to both light microscopy (with differential interference contrast [DIC] optics) and confocal microscopy. Alternative methods for mounting embryos, such as poly-L-lysine-coated slides with grease feet (see [Suspended Embryo Mount for Imaging *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] [Mohler and Isaacson 2010]) or polymer beads, are often used to avoid compression to the embryo. However, these techniques typically result in random embryo orientation, which can complicate analysis of development. Additionally, the slight compression of the coverslip seems to have little to no effect on development; in most cases, avoidance of such compression is unnecessary. In conclusion, preparing *C. elegans* embryos on an agar mount is a simple technique that can be easily mastered and is regularly performed by undergraduates in the investigators’ laboratories. It provides a consistent embryonic orientation and environment that is suitable for long-term microscopy of *C. elegans* embryos. ### REFERENCES 1.
