50|$|Schoenoplectus pungens is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the sedge family known by the common names common <b>threesquare,</b> common three-square bulrush and sharp club-rush. It is a herbaceous emergent plant that is widespread across much of North and South America as well as Europe, New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
50|$|Other plants {{occurring}} in the higher-salinity regions of the marsh include saltmeadow cordgrass (S. patens),giant cordgrass (S. cynosuroides), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), glassworts (Salicornia spp.), Olney <b>threesquare</b> (Scirpus americanus), and saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus robustus). In the brackish marsh plant associates may include sealavender (Limonium carolinianum) and common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia). In the intermediate marsh between the brackish and freshwater marsh levels other plants include common reed (Phragmites australis), sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), softstem bulrush (Scirpus validus), and Virginia iris (Iris virginica).|$|E
50|$|Vegetation is diverse on {{the island}} and {{consists}} of saltmeadow cordgrass, saltmarsh bulrush, salt marsh cattail, and American <b>threesquare</b> that naturally flourished behind the berms. Originally, smooth cordgrass was the only species that was planted. A report by the Mobile Register in mid-2011 showed that pelican populations {{on the island}} dramatically increased from 2010. The report also indicated the pelicans on the island showed no effects stemming from the 2010 BP oil spill in terms of finding a reliable food source, a previous concern from environmental officials.|$|E
40|$|The pithy, {{cylindrical}} stalks {{were used}} to weave matting, {{as well as for}} bedding and roofing material. As thatching material, common <b>threesquare</b> was spread out in bundles, tied together, then secured in place with poles. Various indigenous peoples of Canada ate the fleshy rootstocks and rhizomes (Kunlein and Turner 1991). The Kwakiutl used the stalks and oil on a child’s head to make the hair grow long and thick (Moerman 1998). Conservation: Common <b>threesquare</b> is especially good for stabilizing or restoring disturbed or degraded areas, for erosion and slope control, and for wildlife food and cover. Its dense root mass makes this species resistant to soil compaction and erosion making it an excellent choice for soil stabilization in wetland and riparian sites. Wildlife: The seed is used by wetland birds including: baldpate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} original DC-DCstep-up converter topology for switchmode DC powersupplies. The proposed architecture is well suited for highpower applications with battery supply. A prototype was realized and tested for the power supply ofautomotive devices. In this environment signals arecharacterized by high dynamic variations, thus ihey can beoperated only relying on power supplies with high dynamiccapabiliiies. The latter constraint can be SChieVed only usingdosed-loop switch-mode DUDC converters at high switchingfrequency. So doing converter efficiency is reduced, and EMCproblems arise. In summary power supply efficiency andsupply voltage quality are key Ceatures of the converler design. In lhis paper the above mentioned issued were tackledrelying on an open loop topology. The original solution is theadoption of a three-phase transformer with delta-wyeconnection within a full-bridge converter topology. Theproposed architecture will {{be referred to as}} 3 boost powersupply. The three-phase transformer replaces the commonsingle-phase transformer and it is supplied at primary by <b>threesquare</b> waves, produced by a three-phase full bridge inverter. At secondary a three-phase full wave diode rectiller is used toobtain the output DC voltage level. The proposed architecture is patent pending...|$|E
40|$|Waterfowl {{have been}} shown to be {{important}} dispersers of different species of aquatic plants and waterfowl digestion of seeds can affect seed dormancy loss. The impact of digestion on seeds of different sizes may also differentially affect seed dormancy loss. In this study, we are looking at seed size in relation to dormancy loss in two bulrush species (Schoenoplectus spp.). Specifically, we are evaluating mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail (Anus acuta) ducks and their effects on three species of bulrush (alkali Schoenoplectus maritimus (large seeds), hardstem S. acutus (small seeds), and <b>threesquare</b> S. americanus (small seeds)). Seeds were collected from the gizzards of hunter harvested ducks. Then, seeds were incubated in the greenhouse at summer temperatures. After germination the seeds were counted and removed. We tested for any significant difference in dormancy loss between large and small seed size after duck ingestion. Our results were compared to undigested seeds (i. e., controls) in an on-going companion seed study. Preliminary results of the study show that duck ingestion has a significant impact on germination percentages. On average, alkali bulrush ingested seeds germinated at 39. 4 % compared to 1 % in control seeds. In the smaller seeded species, 50 % of the duck ingested seeds germinated compared to only 6. 6 % in the control seeds. Our findings suggest a means to produce large numbers of bulrush seedlings to restore habitat in ares cleared of invasive Phragmites australis...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Coastal marsh {{vegetation}} is {{an important}} component in maintaining marsh stability that is threatened by changes in sedimentation, sea level rise, natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and competition from invasive species. Vegetation has been demonstrated to reduce wave energy, increase sedimentation, and decrease erosion in tidal environments under a range of conditions. Similarities and differences between the morphology of vegetation species may {{play an important role in}} understanding the mechanism between vegetation, sedimentation, and wave energy. Diversity of species within vegetation communities has been shown to reduce the success of biological invasions from invasive species as well as increase the ability of the community to adapt to environmental changes such as inundation period (period of time vegetation is submerged partially or fully by water). The species present along coastal marshes and specifically at the interface between vegetated marsh and unvegetated mudflat provide an opportunity to better understand the interactions between vegetation and its physical setting. In this dissertation I focus on the species and vegetation communities that are present at this interface of the terrestrial and aquatic boundary to better understand how plant communities may be characterized, how they respond to disturbance, how they are distributed, and how they may influence the physical environment in which they grow. In Chapter two, I explore the ability to use image analysis and the lateral obstruction of vegetation to describe a species density, height and diameter and evaluate the tradeoffs in using image analysis over more traditional methods. In Chapter three, I evaluate the response of an emergent vegetation species, <b>threesquare</b> bulrush (Schoenoplectus pungens), to different depths of complete burial as could be expected from extreme storms, hurricanes, tsunamis, or restoration efforts involving sediment amendment. Chapter four describes the distribution of coastal marsh communities of the Laurentian Great Lakes along an elevational gradient beginning at the terrestrial and aquatic boundary, identifying patterns of wetland distribution, species composition, and exotic plant invasion. In Chapter five, I conclude the dissertation with an evaluation of the effects of two morphologically distinct species of emergent marsh vegetation, <b>threesquare</b> bulrush and Lyngbye’s sedge (Carex lyngbyei), on the sedimentation rate and variability in Tillamook Bay, OR and compare the results to the current understanding of vegetation-sediment feedback. In Chapter two, I found that for morphologically simple species, such as S. pungens, image analysis of lateral obstruction can be used to determine important morphological characteristics of a stand of vegetation including the mean stem height, density, and mean diameter. The method provides a description of the vertical variation in morphologic structure, providing a rapid analytic tool for exploring the effects of vegetation on wave and sediment interaction. However, I note that more morphologically complex species, such as sedges and grasses may not be as easily described using image analysis. In Chapter three, I determined that aboveground biomass of S. pungens would return to pre-disturbance levels following burial by up to 40 cm of mineral sediment after two years. Vegetation was observed to survive burials depths of up to 80 cm, although initially at much lower density. The aboveground height of stems were statistically similar to unburied controls after two years, which is important for the continuation of ecosystem services such as wave attenuation. The results suggest that S. pungens is capable of returning to pre-disturbance levels of biomass following large natural sedimentation events such as extreme storms, hurricanes, or tsunamis, and that burying portions of marshes with sediment as a restoration tool is not likely to harm the buried vegetation. In Chapter four I refine and describe 21 coastal vegetation communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the ecological gradients along which they are distributed. Latitude, agricultural intensity, site geomorphology, substrate, and water depth were found to be the significant variables that determined community distribution. Additionally, we observed an expansion of invasive plant species near areas of high anthropogenic activity such as farms and urban centers. In Chapter five, I found that there were species-specific differences in sedimentation rate and variability in Tillamook Bay, OR. Schoenoplectus pungens was found to retain more sediment than C. lyngbyei. Sedimentation rate was observed to be variable by location within the estuary. Two patterns of sediment accumulation were observed. The first occurred along vegetation gradients, with increased sedimentation farther into vegetation beds. In the second pattern, sediment accumulation was observed to be greatest at the marsh/mudflat boundary where vegetation was dense and then decreased with increasing depth into the vegetation. In conclusion, this dissertation explores the interaction of emergent wetland vegetation with environmental factors. Image analysis provides a new tool for rapid characterization of vegetation structure, a burial experiment documents Schoenoplectus pungens’ tolerance to sand burial, a field study at Tillamook, OR documents the relationship between sediment accumulation and emergent vegetation beds, and a wetland classification is developed for coastal wetlands along the Great Lakes, which includes plant communities dominated by S. pungens...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Coastal {{vegetation}} dampens waves {{which can}} provide {{benefits to the}} local area, but existing literature shows large variations {{in the degree of}} wave height attenuation depending on plant properties and wave conditions. Better knowledge of how to predict the wave height decay accurately in different types of vegetation may help to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetation. This thesis presents two manuscripts which evaluate and improve existing analytical and numerical models for predicting wave height attenuation in vegetation through comparison with small-scale and prototype-scale experiments with artificial and natural vegetation, respectively. The first manuscript used a quarter scale physical model experiment and a phase resolving numerical model (FUNWAVE) to evaluate random wave attenuation through two types of synthetic vegetation. Measurements were made for a control channel, each vegetation type separately, and the two vegetation types combined. The wave height attenuation was modeled with existing equations and gave an average root mean square error of 1. 5 %. The linear combination of the attenuation coefficients obtained from the individual plants provided a good prediction of the attenuation coefficient for the cases of the combined, heterogeneous vegetation. FUNWAVE was used to model wave attenuation for the individual and combined tests using a bottom friction factor calibrated for each run. The numerical attenuation followed the same trends as the measured data, with an average root mean square error of 1. 7 %. Similar to the physical model study, {{it was found that the}} linear combination of the calibrated model friction factors for the cases of the individual plants reasonably predicted the wave height attenuation for the cases of the combined vegetation with an average root mean square error of 3. 2 %. The second manuscript used a large wave flume and a numerical model to investigate wave height attenuation caused by emergent coastal vegetation. The experiments used <b>threesquare</b> bulrush (Schoenoplectus pungens) and tested regular and irregular waves typical of conditions in a coastal estuary. The attenuation curves were fit to existing equations to determine the drag coefficient, C[subscript d]. The drag coefficients were fit as functions of the Reynolds number (Re) and Keulegan Carpenter number (KC) with R² values ranging from 0. 31 to 0. 67 for the Re number and from 0. 38 to 0. 77 for the KC number, indicating that either Re or KC can be used to predict C[subscript d]. The measured attenuation was modeled with SWAN-VEG, a phase averaged spectral wave model which includes a module to account for attenuation due to vegetation with a tunable coefficient, C[subscript d]. C[subscript d] was determined two ways. First, C[subscript d] was estimated from the Re and KC values using the empirical equations tuned to the measurements. For this case, the model produced root mean square errors ranging from 6. 8 % to 8. 0 %. Second, C[subscript d] was calibrated directly with the observations for each case. For this method, the model produced root mean square errors ranging from 1. 4 % to 5. 9 %, indicating that the model accuracy could be improved if the empirical equations to predict C[subscript d] based on Re or KC could be improved. Finally, the observed and predicted spectra were compared. In the frequencies near the peak energy, the modeled spectra matched most cases with good agreement, but the model was less accurate at higher frequencies near the second harmonic...|$|E
