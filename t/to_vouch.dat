5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory had a {{governing}} board, {{the members of}} which were Oppenheimer, Bacher, Bethe, Kennedy, D. L. Hughes (Personnel Director), D. P. Mitchell (Procurement Director) and Deak Parsons. McMillan, George Kistiakowsky and Kenneth Bainbridge were later added. The laboratory was organized into five divisions: Administration (A), Theoretical (T) under Bethe, Experimental Physics (P) under Bacher, Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) under Kennedy, and Ordnance and Engineering (E) under Parsons. All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be given access to the Technical Area without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched for senior scientists, and three other employees were sufficient <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for a junior scientist or technician.|$|E
25|$|The Church has {{collected}} over 50,000 testimonies of incidents that it considers healing through Christian Science treatment alone.

25|$|On March 21, 1908, as {{a result}} of a dispute with a tailor over a suit, Robinson was arrested in New York City for armed robbery. On September 30, he was convicted and sentenced to 11–15 years hard labor at Sing Sing prison. Robinson had failed to take the charges and trial seriously and paid little {{attention}} to mounting a defense. After his conviction, Robinson's partner, George Cooper, organized his most influential friends <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for him, and hired a new attorney who produced evidence that Robinson had been falsely accused. Though he was exonerated at his second trial and his accusers indicted for perjury, the trial and time spent in the Tombs (Manhattan's prison complex) affected Robinson deeply. After he was released, he made a point of registering his pistol at the local police station of each town where he performed. Robinson's second wife, Fanny, also sent a letter of introduction with complimentary tickets and other gifts to the local police chief's wife in each town ahead of Robinson's engagements.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{controversy}} {{stems from}} {{the manner in which}} the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has been handling marriage and conversion decisions in recent years. Conversions and marriages within Israel are legally controlled by the Orthodox Israeli Chief Rabbinate; therefore, a person not proven to be a Jew to the Rabbinate's satisfaction is not legally permitted to marry a Jew in Israel today. Although the Rabbinate has always refused to accept non-Orthodox conversions, until recent years it was more willing to accept the Jewish parentage of applicants based on personal testimony, and the validity of conversions based on the testimony of Orthodox Rabbis. However, in recent years the rabbinate, whose rabbis historically had a more Modern Orthodox orientation, has increasingly been filled by the more stringent Haredi camp. It has increasingly been inclined to presume that applicants are not Jewish until proven otherwise, and require more stringent standards of proof than in the past. It has implemented a policy of refusing to accept the testimony of non-Orthodox Jews in matters of Jewish status, on grounds that such testimony is not reliable. It also has been increasingly skeptical of the reliability of Orthodox rabbis ordained by institutions not subject to its accreditation, particularly in matters of conversion. Accordingly, non-Orthodox Jews born to Jewish parents, and some Jews converted by Orthodox rabbis, have been increasingly unable to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate's satisfaction, because they are unable to find an Orthodox rabbi who is both acceptable to the Rabbinate, and familiar with and willing <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for the Jewishness of their maternal lineage or the validity of their conversion.|$|E
25|$|During the {{continued}} playoff drought, {{instability in the}} front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss. In July, Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525 or $750) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, Big Shot. Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.|$|E

500|$|Specter {{received}} several high-profile endorsements {{during the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} the primary. Senator John Kerry, who had been an early supporter of Sestak's 2006 House campaign, endorsed Specter in the Senate race, calling him [...] "fighter and a friend, and I am proud <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for his character". The Philadelphia Inquirer called Sestak [...] "a worthy opponent" [...] and said that his determination made the race especially competitive, but ultimately embraced Specter, whose overall career record the newspaper said was [...] "a good choice for Democrats". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Specter, focusing more on the fact that Specter stood the best chance of defeating Toomey in a general election challenge. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, however, endorsed Sestak, calling him [...] "incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and articular" [...] while condemning Specter as a [...] "self-serving political ferret" [...] for switching parties. Actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared in a television advertisement for Specter, praising the Senator for his long-standing support of stem cell research. Fox said, [...] "In the fight against disease, you can look back or move forward. Arlen Specter is moving forward." [...] President Obama sent e-mail messages to his Organizing for America supporters encouraging them to vote for Specter, However, despite his long position of support for Specter, Obama did not fly to Pennsylvania to actively campaign for the Senator during the campaign's final days.|$|E

2500|$|In 1820 {{the state}} {{legislature}} had already restricted manumissions by requiring that any act of manumission (for an individual only) had {{to be approved by}} both houses of the legislature.

2500|$|Controversially, Bianu {{chose not}} to join the exodus of Romanians headed for Western Moldavia, and {{remained}} with the Germanophiles and neutralists in occupied Bucharest, to 1918. He noted that he watched on, [...] "eyes flooded in tears", as the German Army marched through the streets. One of ten academicians to remain behind, he ensured that the Academy Library continued to function in relatively normal terms, refusing to publish under the occupation regime, but also collaborating with the occupier to at least some degree. Bianu's letters of the occupation are a primary source for the activities of Germanophiles such as Antipa, Petre P. Carp, Alexandru Al. Beldiman, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, and Iacob Negruzzi. Bianu sided with Carp in his critique of PNL politics, but, unlike him and Beldiman, did not call for the dethronement of King Ferdinand. He also refrained from signing up to Carp's openly pro-German platform. Nevertheless, he was remembered by the anti-Germanophiles for participating at banquets hosted by the puppet governor, Lupu Kostaki. The Austro-Hungarian Army also asked Bianu <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for officer Alexandru Leca Morariu, {{who was accused of}} being secretly a Romanian nationalist agitator.|$|E
2500|$|In Who Would Have Thought It?, the {{experience}} of Lola Medina, the supposed protagonist of the story, mirrors many aspects of Ruiz de Burton's own life. [...] The character of Lola is a daughter of an aristocratic Spanish family from Mexico, who is adopted by a respected New England doctor and taken to the East Coast. [...] Lola is well educated, perfectly fluent in Spanish and English, good mannered, yet disrespected by the doctor's Protestant, white family and friends. [...] Lola is ostracized due to her appearances. [...] As a child her skin had been tinted to disguise her as an Indian, setting her apart from the very white ruling New England class. [...] The doctor however, attempts <b>to</b> <b>vouch</b> for her, because he knows the truth of her background, and explains {{that she is not}} in fact [...] "other" [...] as her appearance suggests, but rather has [...] "pure Spanish blood" [...] of potentially royal lineage [...] and deserves to be treated with due respect. [...] In the conclusion of the novel, Lola Medina is sent away to Mexico to be with her family, suggesting that despite her belief and the belief of the educated doctor that she has legitimate right to be in the US, her true place is not there, but in Mexico. [...] In Ruiz de Burtons own life, she was married young to a respected East Coast Protestant man, yet always felt herself to be an outsider in New England, despite her education, wealth, and European lineage.
