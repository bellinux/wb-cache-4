Looking back at Sociobiology 35 years later, the philosopher of biology Michael Ruse called the book [...] "a pretty remarkable achievement" [...] of huge scope, [...] "firmly in the Darwinian paradigm of evolution through natural selection". He found one aspect of the book [...] "very peculiar" [...] in its [...] "metaphysical underpinning", namely that Wilson was committed to the idea of progress in biology, [...] "the idea that organic life has proceeded from the very simple to the very complex, from the value-free to the value-laden, from (as <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the 19th century) the monad to the man." [...] Ruse observed that while producing humans might look like progress, evolution had [...] "also produced smallpox and syphilis and potato blight," [...] raising [...] "serious doubts about whether evolution is progressive." [...] Ruse noted that Gould's 1989 book Wonderful Life was entirely an attack on this idea of progress.|$|E

In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection.

40|$|Changes, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> are {{the only}} {{constant}} in life. Everything changes rapidly around us, {{and more and more}} key to survival is the ability to rapidly adapt to changes. This consideration applies to many aspects of our lives. Strangely enough, this nearly self-evident truth is not always considered by software engineers with the seriousness that it calls for: The assumptions we draw for our systems often do not take into due account that e. g., the run-time environments, the operational conditions, or the available resources will vary. Software is especially vulnerable to this threat, and with today’s software-dominated systems controlling crucial services in nuclear plants, airborne equipments, health care systems and so forth, it becomes clear how this situation may potentially lead to catastrophes. This paper discusses this problem and defines some of the requirements towards its effective solution, which we call “New Software Development ” as a software equivalent of the well-known concept of New Product Development. The paper also introduces and discusses a practical example of a software tool designed taking those requirements into account—an adaptive data integrity provision in which the degree of redundancy is not fixed once and for all at design time, but rather it changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time. ...|$|R
