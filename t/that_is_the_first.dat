25|$|If, {{like other}} Platonists, he {{designated}} the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was probably described by {{him as the}} first defined duality, the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude {{in the sphere of}} the material and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving number, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> number endowed with motion. To this world-soul Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of Olympic gods. As a sublunary daemonical power (as Hera, Poseidon, Demeter), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical natures, midway between gods and men, are related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene. The divine world-soul which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity.|$|E

He did not emphasise his discovery of [...] "dephlogisticated air" [...] (leaving it to Part III of the volume) but instead argued in the preface how important such discoveries were to rational religion. His paper narrated the discovery chronologically, relating the long delays between experiments and his initial puzzlements; thus, {{it is difficult to}} determine when exactly Priestley [...] "discovered" [...] oxygen. Such dating is significant as both Lavoisier and Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele have strong claims to the discovery of oxygen as well, Scheele having been the first to isolate the gas (although he published after Priestley) and Lavoisier having been the first to describe it as purified [...] "air itself entire without alteration" [...] (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to explain oxygen without phlogiston theory).|$|E
