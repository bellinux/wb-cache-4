25|$|A $22.6billion International Monetary Fund and World Bank {{financial}} package was approved on 13 July 1998 to support reforms and stabilize the Russian market by swapping out an enormous {{volume of the}} quickly maturing GKO short-term bills into long-term Eurobonds.

25|$|In November 1991, the Currency Issue Law {{was passed}} and the Litas Committee was created. It {{had the power to}} fix the date for the litas to come into circulation, the terms for the {{withdrawal}} from circulation of <b>the</b> <b>ruble,</b> the exchange rate of the litas and other conditions. Officials waited for a while for the economy to stabilize to not to expose the young litas to inflation. About 80% of Lithuania's trade was with Russia and the government needed {{to find a way to}} smooth the transition from <b>the</b> <b>ruble</b> zone. Also, Lithuania needed to gather funds to form a stabilization fund.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} of the Russian government to implement a coherent set of economic reforms led to a severe erosion in investor confidence and a chain reaction that can be likened to a run on the Central Bank. Investors fled the market by selling rubles and Russian assets (such as securities), which also put downward pressure on <b>the</b> <b>ruble.</b> This forced the Central Bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend Russia's currency, which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined <b>the</b> <b>ruble.</b> It is estimated that between 1 October 1997 and 17 August 1998, the Central Bank expended approximately $27billion of its U.S. dollar reserves to maintain the floating peg.|$|E
25|$|From 17 to 25 August 1998, <b>the</b> <b>ruble</b> {{steadily}} depreciated on the MICEX, {{moving from}} 6.43 to 7.86 RUB/USD. On 26 August 1998, the Central Bank terminated dollar-ruble {{trading on the}} MICEX, and the MICEX did not fix a ruble-dollar rate that day.|$|E

50|$|Gorbachev's {{economic}} changes {{did not do}} much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s.

25|$|The {{official}} aims of {{the reform}} were the fight against inflation, the retirement of the old treasury bills of the State Bank of the USSR and {{the separation of the}} monetary systems of Russia and the other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. <b>The</b> <b>ruble</b> would be a means of payment in only domestic money circulation.|$|E
25|$|Taxes {{were raised}} and {{religious}} institutions {{were forced to}} close. The Soviets replaced the zloty with <b>the</b> <b>ruble,</b> but gave them blatantly absurd equal value. Businesses were mandated to stay open and sell at pre-war prices, hence allowing Soviet soldiers to buy goods with rubles. Entire hospitals, schools and factories were moved to the USSR.|$|E

Moshe Dovid had children from a previous marriage who lived in America; they would send their father three <b>rubles</b> (<b>the</b> equivalent of one dollar) each month.

25|$|Like {{other republics}} of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan {{continued}} using <b>the</b> Soviet/Russian <b>ruble</b> after independence.

25|$|Uzbekistan {{replaced}} <b>the</b> <b>ruble</b> with soʻm at par in on November 15, 1993.

Because {{it was meant}} to be a transitional currency, the design was rather simplistic. All notes had the Coat of arms on obverse, and Sher-Dor Madrasah of the Registan in Samarkand on reverse.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{financial}} crisis (also called Ruble crisis or the Russian Flu) hit Russia on 17 August 1998.

The crisis had severe impacts on the economies of many neighboring countries. Meanwhile, James Cook, the {{senior vice president of}} The U.S. Russia Investment Fund, suggested the crisis had the positive effect of teaching Russian banks to diversify their assets.|$|E
25|$|Another Constantine ruble without edge relief, <b>the</b> {{so-called}} Richter <b>ruble,</b> {{emerged during}} World War I.

A third ruble of this type, <b>the</b> Garshin-Fuchs <b>ruble,</b> resurfaced in Germany in 1981 and is also considered genuine.

25|$|Declining productivity, a high fixed {{exchange}} rate between <b>the</b> <b>ruble</b> and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons {{that led to the}} crisis. The economic cost of the first war in Chechnya, estimated at $5.5billion (not including the rebuilding of the ruined Chechen economy), also contributed to the crisis. In the first half of 1997, the Russian economy showed some signs of improvement. However, soon after this, the problems began to gradually intensify.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} (right {{after the}} annexation), salaries rose, {{especially those of}} government workers, this was soon offset by the increase in prices caused by the depreciation of <b>the</b> <b>ruble.</b> Subsequently, after Russian authority became established, wages were cut back again by 30% to 70%. Tourism, previously Crimea's main industry, suffered in particular; it was down by 50% from 2014. Crimean agricultural yields were also significantly impacted by the annexation. Ukraine cut off supplies of water through the North Crimean Canal, causing the 2014 rice crop to fail, and greatly damaging the maize and soybean crops.|$|E
25|$|In June 1992, Estonia {{replaced}} <b>the</b> <b>ruble</b> {{with its}} own freely convertible currency, the kroon (EEK).

When Germany introduced the euro the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro. Estonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008 but due to high inflation rates the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state.|$|E
