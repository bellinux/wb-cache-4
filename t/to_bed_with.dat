5|$|In February and March 2009, Morrison {{returned}} to the US for Astral Weeks Live concerts, interviews and TV appearances with concerts at Madison Square Garden and at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. He was interviewed by Don Imus on his Imus in the Morning radio show and put in guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Live with Regis and Kelly. Morrison continued with the Astral Weeks performances with two concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London in April and then {{returned to}} California in May 2009 performing the Astral Weeks songs at the Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley, the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Morrison filmed the concerts at the Orpheum Theatre so they could be viewed by Farrah Fawcett, confined <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> cancer and thus unable to attend the concerts.|$|E

Newspaper photographs from the time show a fireman carrying an emotional, partially clothed and toupee-less Hawtrey down a ladder to safety.|$|E
50|$|Edward {{became a}} public, tax-supported entity in 1959. As the Naperville, Illinois {{community}} grew, Edward expanded, adding patient care units and providing patients with more advanced technology. In 1962, the hospital expanded <b>to</b> 110 <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> state-of-the-art all-electric <b>beds,</b> a nurse call communication system and piped-in oxygen. Just five years later, in 1967, Edward grew <b>to</b> 133 <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> a $620,000 {{addition to the}} main building.|$|R

25|$|Donna helps David {{when he is}} {{diagnosed}} with manic depressive. David is also briefly hospitalized. David took Donna on a trip {{because he wanted to}} go <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her, but she told him again that she would wait. On their graduation evening, Donna David tells her that she is ready and after many years of waiting, they go to bed together.|$|E
25|$|Donna's {{first true}} boyfriend is David Silver, who decides to get {{together}} at a school ball. After being together for a few months, David tried to get Donna <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him where she confesses and says she is a virgin and she will wait until she gets married. David wants to wait until she is ready and their relationship continues. David also helps Donna when she discovers her mother's affair with another man.|$|E
25|$|David is Donna unfaithful in the summer, but he apologizes {{and says}} he loves her. Donna forgive him afterwards. A year later, David again tries to go <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Donna, but she will {{continue}} to wait. However, she contributes to a school ball. But Donna drinks too much champagne and gets drunk and it goes into the sink. Donna will subsequently know {{that she can not}} graduate because of a student protest. However, she will be allowed to graduate later.|$|E

25|$|King Arthur (Arthus) - Arthur is noble king of Britain, {{cultivating}} {{the ideal}} of the chivalrous knight operating under an honourable code of conduct. He started the fellowship of the Round Table after drawing the sword from the stone, thereby fulfilling a prophecy and proving his right to rule. Years ago, Merlin informed Arthur that once he was tricked into going <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Morgana, disguised by a spell, and the issue of their union was to be the instrument of Arthur's death. Arthur loves his wife, Guinevere dearly, but projects onto her an ideal which she cannot possibly live up to.|$|E
25|$|He was {{introduced}} to golf at an exceptionally young age by his father, who coached him. Gerry McIlroy is a fine golfer himself, who once played at a scratch handicap level. He asked his father virtually every day {{to take him to}} Holywood Golf course. Family lore relates that he received a new golf club as a present, being shown the correct grip by his father, then taking the club <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him that night, with his hands holding the club properly. McIlroy joined Holywood Golf Club and became the youngest member at the club. A video on golf technique produced by champion Nick Faldo was his early favourite.|$|E
25|$|Religious and {{ceremonial}} reasons {{have also been}} a factor. Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727), an Italian nun and mystic, was known for taking a lamb <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her and suckling it {{as a symbol of}} the Lamb of God. In far northern Japan, the Ainu people are noted for holding an annual bear festival at which a captured bear, raised and suckled by the women, is sacrificed. Bears were also suckled by the Itelmens of the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia but in their case for economic reasons, to benefit from the meat when the bear was grown and to obtain highly prized bear bile for use in traditional medicine.|$|E

50|$|In 1957 the {{hospital}} was extended <b>to</b> 300 <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> two operating theatres and 11 wards including one for children. Male nurses were from the RAM Corps and female nurses from QARANC.|$|R
25|$|The {{first issue}} facing Johnston in the West was {{the fate of}} Braxton Bragg. The Confederate {{government}} was displeased with Bragg's performance at the Battle of Stones River, as were many of Bragg's senior subordinates. Jefferson Davis ordered Johnston to visit Bragg and determine whether he should be replaced. Johnston realized that if he recommended Bragg's replacement, {{he would be the}} logical choice to succeed him, and he considered that a field army command was more desirable than his current, mostly administrative post, but his sense of honor prevented him from achieving this personal gain at Bragg's expense. After interviewing Bragg and a number of his subordinates, he produced a generally positive report and refused to relieve the army commander. Davis ordered Bragg to a meeting in Richmond and designated Johnston to take command in the field, but Bragg's wife was ill and he was unable to travel. Furthermore, in early April Johnston was forced <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> lingering problems from his Peninsula wound, and the attention of the Confederates shifted from Tennessee to Mississippi, leaving Bragg in place.|$|E
25|$|Pippa {{has been}} put <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a {{sleeping}} draught. Clarissa {{has set up a}} card table for bridge when her three guests arrive back, summoned by a phone call from her. She asks them to move the body to Costello's car which she knows is parked some distance from the house to a local wood. Their alibi will be the bridge game for which she has set up the cards with false scores to indicate the progress of some time having elapsed. She tells them that her motive is Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement. Wearing gloves supplied by Clarissa, they manage to move the body back into the recess, with the intention of moving him later, but are interrupted when the police unexpectedly arrive. Inspector Lord is there following a mysterious phone call to the station telling them that a murder has been committed at the house.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they had}} won the 1947–48 Sheffield Shield Western Australia were its weakest team (Tasmania was not yet included) and {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} Australia, so they provided an easy start for the MCC's round of state matches. The WACA Ground would not see a Test match until the 1970-71 Ashes series, so this was the only occasion for the Perth crowd to see a Test team in action. Freddie Brown won the toss and elected to bat, only to see his openers Reg Simpson and David Sheppard out for 5 runs, surprised by the swing they had been told was rare in Australia. Gilbert Parkhouse was bowled at 25/3 and it took Denis Compton (106) and John Dewes (94) to restore the innings with a partnership of 183. The vice-captain was particularity pleased with his century as it silenced the critics who thought him unfit to play and he managed to run between the wickets and step out to drive the bowlers without any fuss. Brian Close made an unbeaten 108, his maiden first-class century, although he almost walked on 91 before he found that what he had thought was a catch had taken the ball over the boundary. Godfrey Evans (43) and Alec Bedser (42) helped him hit the ball around and Brown declared on 434/9. Doug Wright proved to have one of his more productive days, but his 7/60 failed to enforce the follow on by two runs as Western Australia reached 236 thanks to their captain Doug Carmody (59) and Chris Langdon (60). The MCC hustled up 121/3 in 124 minutes before Brown declared again and set the home team 320 to win in under three hours. Bedser was confined <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> influenza and there was no fear of a result as Western Australia made 207/4 with Tom Outridge belting 3 sixes and 9 fours in his 92 with Close suffering 3/81 off 13 overs. This was the youngster's first proper bowl and it badly affected him and destroyed his confidence to bowl on Australian pitches where he could get little movement with the ball, to the point that Brown reserved him for the country matches after the Second Test. A disgruntled Gilbert Parkhouse had been shoved into the slip cordon, where he dropped three catches and the MCC's poor fielding soon lead to them being called Brown's Cows by the Australian press.|$|E

500|$|According to Rockwell, who did {{not really}} care much for the work, the theme [...] "was based on a rather smug idea.

500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} Zampanò came from Fellini's youth in the coastal town of Rimini.

[...] In 1992, Fellini told Canadian director Damian Pettigrew that he had conceived the film {{at the same time as}} co-scenarist Tullio Pinelli in a kind of [...] "orgiastic synchronicity": ...|$|E

After the party she goes <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they lie in bed together, Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, you look like a guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E
500|$|In {{a display}} of both aspects of machismo, Trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo's machismo and {{treatment}} of women, [...] "e went <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> his ministers' wives, not only because he liked these ladies {{but because it was}} a way to test his ministers. He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque roleand they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death." [...] Trujillo's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In Niessa's words, [...] "The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|Ned and Maude Flanders sing Maggie <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> {{their own}} version of Sonny & Cher's song [...] "I Got You Babe".

Flanders says that he used to let his sons watch My Three Sons, but it got them [...] "all worked up" [...] before bedtime. The headline of a newspaper that Marge gives to Lisa for her history project is [...] "40 Trampled at Poco Concert", a reference to American rock band Poco. While riding in Flanders's car, Maggie spins her head around with a scary smile on her face to look at Bart and Lisa, as in the 1973 film The Exorcist.|$|E
