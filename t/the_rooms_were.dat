5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rooms</b> <b>were</b> {{opened to}} the public by Mrs Thatcher on 4 April 1984, in a {{ceremony}} attended by Churchill family members and former Cabinet War Rooms staff. At first <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> <b>were</b> administered by the museum on behalf of Department for the Environment; in 1989 responsibility was transferred to the Imperial War Museum.|$|E
5|$|The Raymonds {{modified}} {{the house to}} create a more open plan feel, separated by Japanese fusuma partitions and shōji screens. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> filled with objects of art, including rugs designed by Noémi and crockery by the Mingei designer Minagawa Masu.|$|E
5|$|La Pausa {{contains}} three wings {{that face}} onto a shaded courtyard, with the rooms containing large fireplaces. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> filled by Chanel with 16th-century English oak furniture, {{given to her}} by the Duke of Westminster; English oak was also used for floors and panelling. The large reception rooms were lit by wrought-iron chandeliers from Spain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Social <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} to its early 20th century appearance in a $500,000 project funded by Kenneth and Janet Keene, for whom <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> renamed. <b>The</b> restored <b>room</b> <b>was</b> dedicated on November 12, 1998. http://www.clas.ufl.edu/alumni/alumninotes/99spring/atc.htmlhttp://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-18843800.html ...|$|R
50|$|The {{walls are}} lined with {{cushions}} for seating and the centrepiece of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a sprawling candle holder with many candles. These candles <b>are</b> lit whenever <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> used for reflections.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Stove <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} <b>the</b> south {{part of the}} west wing. From spring to fall, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{contains}} many butterflies and the exhibit {{is known as the}} Butterfly Forest. The plants in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> representative of <b>the</b> deep tropics, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> maintained at a temperature of 80 F during the day and 70 F during the night.|$|R
5|$|The frescoes {{decorating the}} open arcade {{known as the}} Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who {{imported}} works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> refurnished and redecorated. Many of the marble floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> <b>were</b> {{not open}} to the general public, they could be {{accessed}} by appointment, with access being restricted to small groups. Even so, by the 1970s (with responsibility for the Rooms having passed to the Department for the Environment in 1975) {{tens of thousands of}} requests to visit <b>the</b> <b>Rooms</b> <b>were</b> being received every year, of which only 5,000 were successful. Meanwhile, the atmospheric conditions of the site, being dry and dusty, were having a detrimental effect on the rooms' furnishings and historic maps and other documents. The prospect was raised of decanting the contents of the Rooms to an established museum, with the National Army Museum and Imperial War Museum being suggested as candidates. In the event, £7,000 was secured to conserve the material in situ.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> above ground and had little protection. If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> {{variously}} {{considered a}} part of the Vatican Library and Vatican Museums. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> now used for the Vatican Collection of Modern Religious Art, inaugurated by Pope Paul VI in 1973.|$|R
50|$|The large {{courtyard}} <b>is</b> {{surrounded by}} <b>rooms</b> behind arched stoa. <b>The</b> corner <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> reached by a diagonal passage. There <b>are</b> 28 <b>rooms</b> on ground floor, {{which have a}} window next to their door under the stoa facing the courtyard. Entrance to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> over a step. The fireplace in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> situated in <b>the</b> wall separating <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>is</b> flanked by two small closets.|$|R

5|$|The barracks {{was less}} than 10yards wide and 33yards long (9mx30m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, {{containing}} 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin lathe and plaster partitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{rooms on}} {{the north and east}} sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of the}} private staircase.|$|E
5|$|This {{multi-storied}} ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, {{is located in}} the largest alcove {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.|$|E

5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> {{later on}} used to house five 'halfway housemates' {{as part of}} a twist. It {{included}} a dormitory, common room, wash room and kitchenette as well as a small garden.|$|E

25|$|A second hall {{is located}} downstairs; {{it is much}} smaller than the main prayer hall. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} opened for Friday prayers and Salat al Eid. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> mainly used for storage but opens every year for the Islam Festival Edinburgh.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> West Sitting <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> a parlour {{that has}} been the setting for many {{interviews}} with heads of state and Members of Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> laid with original timber flooring from the 1930s. Displayed on the walls of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> priceless replicas of Arab tapestry presented by the Sultan of Oman to President Ong Teng Cheong in the 1990s.|$|R
25|$|The {{basement}} proper was {{one hundred}} {{feet long and}} forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sized on either side. The sides of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With {{the exception of the}} two rooms at the West end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down {{to the center of the}} room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.|$|E
25|$|The tepidarium {{would have}} led into the hot room, the caldarium, which {{included}} two hot baths, one which still contains {{the remains of a}} seat. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> heated by a hypocaust – the furnace is still visible on the north side.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> {{refurbished}} {{to their}} 19th century glory. Highlighting the ballroom are the hand-cut glass chandelier and four wooden, hand-carved Greek columns, surviving examples of western Pennsylvania’s Greek classical revival period popular {{with those of}} means in the 1830s.|$|E
500|$|<b>Room</b> 2 <b>is</b> one of {{the best}} {{preserved}} of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> atop Structure 4. It measured [...] north-south by [...] east-west. The doorway to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> [...] wide. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> has <b>been</b> dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|R
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and logic, a vacuous truth {{is a statement}} that asserts that {{all members of the}} empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned off" [...] will be true whenever there are no cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In this case, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on" [...] would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on and turned off".|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{extension}} {{takes the}} form of a long narrow <b>room</b> running <b>the</b> length of the building. A sliding timber door opens into the main hall. One end of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> partitioned to form a commercial kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> ceiled with sheeting.|$|R
25|$|For the BBTV task, a {{newsroom}} was built, {{where two}} housemates transmitted {{news to the}} rest of the house, such as messages from home. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> also used as a studio for a gameshow and later a talent show.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{red brick}} {{building}} with patent Victoria stone dressings surrounded by a verandah of iron columns. In 1904 all the windows had Venetian blinds, and all <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> ventilated by Boyle's fresh air inlet ventilators. There were gas brackets in every room.|$|E
25|$|Possibilities {{of sensory}} leakage in the {{ganzfeld}} experiments included the receivers hearing {{what was going}} on in the sender's room next door as <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.|$|E
50|$|<b>Room</b> 2 <b>is</b> one of {{the best}} {{preserved}} of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> atop Structure 4. It measured 2.9 m north-south by 0.5 m east-west. The doorway to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> 1.8 m wide. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> has <b>been</b> dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|R
