5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, he possibly acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region.|$|E

25|$|One economist's {{analysis}} calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a {{deadweight loss}} under orthodox microeconomic theory, {{because of the}} effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.|$|E
25|$|While {{the exact}} number of Iraqi combat {{casualties}} has yet to be firmly determined, sources agree that the losses were substantial. Immediate estimates said up to 100,000 Iraqis were killed. More recent estimates indicate that Iraq probably sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities, though other figures still maintain fatalities could have been as high as 200,000. A report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, estimated 10,000-12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war. <b>This</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports. It is known that between 20,000 and 200,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study, 3,664 Iraqi civilians and between 20,000 and 26,000 military personnel were killed in the conflict. 75,000 Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the fighting.|$|E

25|$|A 2017 phylogenetic {{analysis}} conducted {{based on}} the dataset of McPhee et al., published in 2015 with the description of Pulanesaura, found that Xingxiulong was a basal {{member of the group}} Sauropodiformes once Blikanasaurus was removed from the dataset. Within this group, it is closest to the contemporary Jingshanosaurus. Traits that are shared by Xingxiulong and Jingshanosaurus include the infratemporal fenestra being placed entirely behind the eye socket; the scapula being at least 20% as wide as it is long; the pubic apron, or the bottom of the pubis, having a concave outer face; the expansion {{at the bottom of the}} apron being at least 15% the length of the entire bone; and the angle between the femoral head and the cross-sectional axis of the femoral shaft being about 30°.

25|$|Men are {{affected}} {{three times as}} often as women. There is also marked geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. It {{is the most common}} glomerular disease in the Far East and Southeast Asia, accounting for almost half of all the patients with glomerular disease. However, it accounts for only about 25% of the proportion in European and about 10% among North Americans, with African–Americans having a very low prevalence of about 2%. However, a confounding factor in <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> the existing policy of screening and use of kidney biopsy as an investigative tool. School children in Japan undergo routine urinalysis (as do army recruits in Singapore) and any suspicious abnormality is pursued with a kidney biopsy, which might partly explain the high observed incidence of IgA nephropathy in those countries.|$|E

25|$|Since {{registration}} for the Gypsy Horse has only existed {{within the last}} 20 years, most associations require a genetic analysis for registration, to verify identity and identify future offspring. All of the North American Gypsy Horse and Drum Horse societies employ the Animal Genetics Research Laboratory of the University of Kentucky to perform DNA analysis and maintain a database of registered horses' DNA markers. UKY currently tests markers at 17 loci of a horse's genetic makeup. The aim of <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> to either exclude or fail to exclude another horse as a parent. In a spirit of co-operation, five American breed societies have jointly granted the University of Kentucky permission to employ DNA markers in confirming parentage. Since information regarding the past histories, including parentage, {{of many of the}} Gypsy Horses imported to North America was lost, many owners seek to reclaim the genetic roots of their animals, and services have sprung up to satisfy this desire.|$|E
25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the level of {{subsidies}} paid to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) argues that according to the definitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in Australia by means of direct payments, favourable tax treatment, and other actions. It is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources. Analysis by the ACF indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of A$7.7billion, with the most significant component being the Fuel Tax Credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users. <b>This</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> disputed by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) who argue that the ACF's definition of a subsidy differs from that of the OECD and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view. However, the IPA acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the ACF analysis, some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence.|$|E
25|$|All {{the recent}} {{advances}} in molecular genetics clearly permit the analysis of microbial communities at much finer and functional scales and potentially with more confidence than previous methods. The classical AM fungal identification method of spore extraction from soil and further spore morphological analysis is fraught with complicating issues due to the various strategies and forms of AM fungi, e.g., lack of sporulation in certain species, seasonality, high unculturability, possible misidentification (human error), and new evidence of multi-nucleate spores and high genetic variation within clonal AM species. Because of these various problems, in the past researchers likely misrepresented the true composition of AM fungal communities present at any {{one point in time}} or place. Additionally, by following the traditional extraction, culture and microscopic identification methods, {{there is no way to}} determine active/functioning AM fungal populations, which are likely the most important when attempting to relate plant-AM symbiotic interactions and mechanisms to ecological or ecosystem function. This is especially true in the case of root colonization analyses, which can determine percentage of roots colonized by AM fungi. The major problem with <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> in field soils, which contain multiple species of AM fungi in association with a target plant at the same time (see Ecology of AM). The identification of the associated fungal symbionts is impossible without the use of molecular methods. Though genetic analysis of AM fungal communities has advanced a great deal in the past decade, the methodology is not yet completely refined. Below is an overview of the methods used in molecular genetic analyses of AM fungi, along with applications to research, future directions and some of their problems.|$|E
