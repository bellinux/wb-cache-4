5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George Paget <b>Thomson,</b> the son of J. J. <b>Thomson,</b> Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. <b>Thomson.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide. Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (<b>Thomson,</b> 1949) and californium (<b>Thomson,</b> 1950). Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. <b>Thomson),</b> and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, <b>Thomson,</b> Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming {{were members}} of The Medway Poets {{performance}} group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed. Peter Waite's Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows. In 1982, TVS broadcast a documentary on the poets. That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by <b>Thomson</b> and published by Childish. Group members published dozens of works. The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record The Medway Poets LP. Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years. <b>Thomson</b> got to know Williams, who was a local art student and whose girlfriend {{was a friend of}} Emin; <b>Thomson</b> also met Everall. During the foundation of the group, Ming brought in his girlfriend, Guru, who in turn invited Castle.|$|E

5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. <b>Thomson,</b> as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. <b>Thomson</b> observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. <b>Thomson</b> eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by <b>Thomson,</b> this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E

5|$|While the pay was {{relatively}} good, it still left many players {{looking for other}} jobs during the off-season, while the owners were all wealthy men. The conditions led to two organizing efforts at forming a player's union, which Smythe was vehemently against. From 1957 onwards, Smythe, along with other NHL owners including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings were accused of union busting activities related to the attempt by Ted Lindsay {{and a group of}} NHL players to form an NHL Players Association. Mr. Smythe's role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie, Net Worth. Jimmy <b>Thomson,</b> who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize was singled out by Smythe. Smythe detailed all the monies <b>Thomson</b> had been paid by the organization going back to junior, while he arranged for <b>Thomson</b> to be left off the team, allegedly calling <b>Thomson</b> a traitor and publicly blaming him for the team's poor season. <b>Thomson</b> finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs. <b>Thomson</b> and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago. The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players, such as contributing to the players' pensions. The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union, although it would eventually be organized some ten years later.|$|E

Lord Jauncey commented that the ability to sell the house in fraud of the disposition did not amount to a right in property. Lord Clyde offered different reasoning. He said that the term [...] "Property and Undertaking" [...] used in the Charge Agreement and the legislation had to be construed in its context. He said the Court of Session was wrong to ascribe it a technical meaning. He said that a proper construction of the term was to include only what the company could make use of in its day-to-day business dealings and not all its property in a strict legal sense.|$|R
