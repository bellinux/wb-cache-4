5|$|The <b>textual</b> <b>description</b> of Matrikas is {{generally}} awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven mothers {{are described as}} fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the crow, a carrier of death, in her iconography {{as well as her}} <b>textual</b> <b>description</b> of having crow-like features associate her with death and inauspiciousness. Another motif in her iconography linking her with death is the {{presence of}} a cremation ground and cremation pyres in the background. Her thousand name hymn says that she lives in the cremation ground, sits on a corpse, wears ashes, and blesses those who haunt the grounds. The Prapancasarasara-samgraha relates that she wears a dress taken from a corpse. Dhumavati is the embodiment of tamas guna, associated with ignorance and darkness. She likes meat and wine, both tamasic in nature. The Pranatosinitantra associates her with tamas, when classifying the mahavidyas based on guna.|$|E
40|$|Documenting {{business}} processes using process models is {{common practice in}} many organizations. However, not all process information is best captured in process models. Hence, many organizations complement these models with <b>textual</b> <b>descriptions</b> that specify additional details. The problem with this supplementary use of <b>textual</b> <b>descriptions</b> is that existing techniques for automatically searching process repositories are limited to process models. They are not capable of taking the information from <b>textual</b> <b>descriptions</b> into account and, therefore, provide incomplete search results. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a technique {{that is capable of}} searching textual as well as model-based process descriptions. It automatically extracts process information from both descriptions types and stores it in a unified data format. An evaluation with a large Austrian bank demonstrates that the additional consideration of <b>textual</b> <b>descriptions</b> allows us to identify more relevant processes from a repository...|$|R

These tools use a <b>textual</b> <b>description</b> for use cases and several other tools (such as CBehave) have followed suit. However, this format is not required and so there are other tools that use other formats as well. For example, Fitnesse (which is built around decision tables), has also been used to roll out BDD.|$|E
25|$|By early 1992, {{the search}} was on for a good byte stream {{encoding}} of multi-byte character sets. The draft ISO 10646 standard contained a non-required annex called UTF-1 that provided a byte stream encoding of its 32-bit code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably {{that it did not}} have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or extended ASCII), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21–0x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the Unix path directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a <b>textual</b> <b>description</b> in the annex.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} Jewish {{religious}} practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory, terracotta, faience and seals. As more material evidence emerged, one proposal {{has been that}} Judaism oscillated between idolatry and iconoclasm. However, the dating of the objects and texts suggest that the two theologies and liturgical practices existed simultaneously. The claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in Jewish literature and therefrom in biblical Christian literature, states Janowitz, has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history. The material evidence of images, statues and figurines taken together with the <b>textual</b> <b>description</b> of cherub and [...] "wine standing for blood", for example, suggests that symbolism, making religious images, icon and index has been integral part of Judaism. Every religion has some objects that represent the divine and stand for something {{in the mind of}} the faithful, and Judaism too has had its holy objects and symbols such as the Menorah.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{metamodel}} for <b>textual</b> use case <b>descriptions,</b> structurally conforming to the UML, to specify the behavior of use cases in a flow-oriented manner. While being primarily targeted at supporting requirements engineers in creating consistent use case models, the metamodel defines a textual representation of use case behavior that is easily understandable for readers, who are unaware of the underlying metamodel. Hence, the known benefits of natural language use case descriptions are preserved. Being formalized, consistency between UML-based use case representations and their <b>textual</b> <b>descriptions</b> can be automatically ensured. With NaUTiluS {{we present a}}n extensible, Eclipse-based toolkit, which offers integrated UML use case modeling support, as well as editing capabilities for their <b>textual</b> <b>descriptions...</b>|$|R
