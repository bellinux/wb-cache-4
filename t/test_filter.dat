40|$|Received {{date and}} {{accepted}} date Abstract. The dynamic model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows requires <b>test</b> <b>filtering</b> the resolved velocity fields {{in order to}} determine model coefficients. However, <b>test</b> <b>filtering</b> is costly to perform in large-eddy simulation of complex geometry flows, especially on unstructured grids. The objective of this work is to develop and test an approximate but less costly dynamic procedure which does not require <b>test</b> <b>filtering.</b> The proposed method is based on Taylor series expansions of the resolved velocity fields. Accuracy is governed by the derivative schemes used in the calculation and the number of terms considered in the approximation to the <b>test</b> <b>filtering</b> operator. The expansion is developed up to fourth order, and results are tested a priori based on direct numerical simulation data of forced isotropic turbulence {{in the context of the}} dynamic Smagorinsky model. The tests compare the dynamic Smagorinsky coefficient obtained from filtering with those obtained from application of the Taylor series expansion. They show that the expansion up to second order provides a reasonable approximation to the true dynamic coefficient (with errors on the order of about 5 % for c 2 s), but that including higher-order terms does not necessarily lead to improvements in the results due to inherent limitations in accurately evaluating high-order derivatives. A posteriori tests using the Taylor series approximation in LES of forced isotropic turbulence and channel flow confirm that the Taylor series approximation yields accurate results for the dynamic coefficient. Moreover, the simulations are stable and yield accurate resolved velocity statistics. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) has been {{incorporated}} into a spectral element method and applied in a large eddy simulation (LES) of a turbulent channel flow. The dynamic procedure estimates the parameter of the Smagorinsky model (SM), thereby allowing for an adaption of the mixing length to the local turbulent state during the simulation. As expected, strong fluctuations of the dynamic estimate arise which are due to the local nature of the model. To avoid any adverse influence to the convergence of the numerical scheme, most of these fluctuations are dampened out by averaging along the spanwise (homogeneous) direction and in time. Two different <b>test</b> <b>filter</b> kernels {{have been used in}} order to assess the quality and the robustness of the dynamic procedure and shed light on the dependency of the whole model on the <b>test</b> <b>filter.</b> The simulation results provide a good overall agreement with both experimental data and previous LES results, obtained with the fixedconstant Smagorinsky model...|$|E
40|$|A {{generalized}} {{formulation of}} the Dynamic Smagorinsky Model (DSM) is proposed as a versatile turbulent momentum diffusion scheme for Large-Eddy Simulations. The difference to previous versions of the DSM is a modified <b>test</b> <b>filter</b> range that can be chosen independently from the resolution scale to separate {{the impact of the}} <b>test</b> <b>filter</b> on the simulated flow from the impact of the resolution. The generalized DSM (gDSM) in a two-dimensional version is validated in a verification study as a horizontal momentum diffusion scheme with the Kühlungsborn Mechanistic General Circulation Model at high resolution (wavenumber  330) without hyperdiffusion. Three-day averaged results applying three different test filters in the macro-turbulent inertial range are presented and compared with analogous simulations where the standard DSM is used instead. The comparison of the different filters results in all cases in similar globally averaged Smagorinsky parameters cS≃ 0. 35 c_S≃ 0. 35 and horizontal kinetic energy spectra. Hence, the basic assumption of scale invariance underlying the application of the gDSM to parameterize atmospheric turbulence is justified. In addition, the smallest resolved scales contain less energy when the gDSM is applied, thus increasing the stability of the simulation...|$|E

Oil viscosity was found to increase with increasing soot contamination and decrease with thermooxidative breakdown of the oil. Filtration tests showed that the pressure drop across the filter correlated strongly with oil viscosity and increased linearly with increasing soot content in the oil. Concurrent to the laboratory work, a field test using 15 diesel vehicles was conducted. The vehicles were equipped with <b>test</b> <b>filters</b> identical to the laboratory <b>test</b> <b>filters</b> and were used for approximately 6 months without oil change.

It was found that the use of artificial oil ageing, combined with a discontinuous filtration method developed previously allowed reproduction (in the laboratory) of the filtration processes which occur in vehicle closed crankcase ventilation (CCV) systems. This therefore allowed “realistic” CCV tests to be conducted in a laboratory.

In the experiment, two vertically separated horizontal arrays of 14 three-dimensional sonic anemometers {{were placed in the}} atmospheric surface layer. Subgrid-scale (SGS) and resolved quantities are derived from 2 D filtering at a filter scale D and differentiation of filtered velocity fields. In a previous study the Smagorinsky coefficient was computed directly from these data and found to depend on atmospheric(D) cs stability and height above the ground. The present study examines the scale-invariant dynamic model of Germano et al. and the scale-dependent dynamic model of Porté-Agel et al. and tests their accuracy in predicting and(D) cs its dependencies on stability and height above the ground.

This paper addresses the accuracy improvement of LES of turbulent flows in two ways: (a) from the SGS model standpoint and (b) from the numerical method improvement standpoint. In an internal report, Kotov et al. ("High Order Numerical Methods for large eddy simulation (LES) of Turbulent Flows with Shocks", CTR Tech Brief, Oct. 2014, Stanford University), we performed a preliminary comparative study of different approaches to reduce the loss of accuracy {{within the framework of the}} dynamic Germano SGS model. The high order low dissipative method of Yee & Sjogreen (2009) using local flow sensors to control the amount of numerical dissipation where needed is used for the LES simulation. The considered improved dynamics model approaches include applying the one-sided SGS <b>test</b> <b>filter</b> of Sagaut & Germano (2005) and/or disabling the SGS terms at the shock location. For Mach 1. 5 and 3 canonical shock-turbulence interaction problems, both of these approaches show a similar accuracy improvement to that of the full use of the SGS terms. The present study focuses on a five levels of grid refinement study to obtain the reference direct numerical simulation (DNS) solution for additional LES SGS comparison and approaches. One of the numerical accuracy improvements included here applies Harten's subcell resolution procedure to locate and sharpen the shock, and uses a one-sided <b>test</b> <b>filter</b> at the grid points adjacent to the exact shock location...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the modulation of the radiation spectrum with the use of alternative X-ray filters in the quality of intra-oral digital images from storage phosphor plates. Methods: The radiographic exposures were performed in a GE 1000 X-ray machine (General Electric Co., Milwaukee, WI), operating at 65 kVp, 10 mA, 40 cm focus receptor distance using three different exposure times: 0. 05 s, 0. 16 s and 0. 35 s. The control filter (GC) was 100 % aluminium (Al) with a thickness of 1. 5 mm. The <b>tested</b> <b>filters</b> were: G 1, 97 % Al and 3 % copper (Cu) with 1. 47 mm thickness; G 2, 96 % Al and 4 % Cu with 1. 53 mm thickness; G 3, 95 % Al and 5 % zinc (Zn) with 1. 56 mm thickness; G 4, 98 % Al and 2 % Zn with 1. 5 mm thickness; and G 5, 95 % Cu and 5 % Zn with 1. 6 Trim thickness. For formation of the image, a 12 -step Al wedge (each step with increments of 1 mm in thickness) was radiographed 10 times.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the potential of manganese oxide-coated media to shorten the ripening time of filters with virgin media, under practical conditions. A full scale filter filled with virgin sand and a full scale filter filled with anthracite/sand were operated at two groundwater treatment plants, in parallel with (full scale) <b>test</b> <b>filters,</b> with an additional layer of Manganese Oxide-Coated Sand (MOCS) or Manganese Oxide-Coated Anthracite (MOCA). Significantly different ripening times were observed to achieve an effective {{manganese removal}}: 55 days for a filter with virgin sand and 16 days for a filter with virgin anthracite/sand, respectively. The observed differences could be attributed to different feed water quality, different iron loading, and backwashing intensity and frequency.

The models exploit one-parameter second- or fourth-order filters of Pade type, which permit the cutoff wavenumber k(sub c) to be tuned independently of the grid increment (delta) x. The modeled (M) and exact (E) SGS-stresses are compared component-wise by correlation coefficients of the form C(E,M) computed over the entire three-dimensional fields.
