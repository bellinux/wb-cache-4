5|$|Goldfaden's father {{wrote him}} to solicit <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> {{to come to}} Odessa in Ukraine, which was then part of Imperial Russia. The timing was opportune: {{the end of the}} war meant that much of his best {{audience}} were now in Odessa rather than Bucharest; Rosenberg had already quit Goldfaden's troupe and was performing the Goldfadenian repertoire in Odessa.|$|E

At the age of 14, he joined a {{travelling}} musical troupe headed by his elder brother, Pavalar Varadarajan, and spent the next decade performing throughout South India.

5|$|On March 13, 1918, Grant was {{expelled}} from Fairfield.

5|$|To help {{design the}} next major show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} from the National Circus School {{who had been working}} in Belgium. When he joined <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> in 1985, he brought with him his experience in commedia dell'arte techniques, which he imparted to the performers. Although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct every show up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E
5|$|Barrymore {{began to}} contact his family's {{theatrical}} connections {{to find work}} and approached Charles Frohman, {{who had been the}} producer of Captain Jinks and had also been an employer of Barrymore's mother Georgie a decade earlier. Frohman thought that Barrymore had comedic potential but needed more experience before making a Broadway debut. Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew's father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in Magda, and in November when <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> produced Leah the Forsaken, he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.|$|E

5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in The Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for <b>the</b> <b>troupe,</b> including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>troupes</b> de la Marine {{were the}} only regular troops in Nouvelle-France from 1682 to 1755, while several other battalions were sent to North America. The {{majority}} of the officers and soldiers were recruited in France, while the officers became more often Canadian. Service in <b>the</b> <b>troupes</b> de la Marine was {{an important source of}} economic opportunity, and a prestige for the elite of Nouvelle-France. There was often a waiting list to be nominated as an officer in the companies of <b>the</b> <b>troupes</b> de la marine. While the force of <b>the</b> <b>troupes</b> varied from one period to another, during the Seven Years' War, there were forty companies in the valley of Saint-Laurent and at the Pays d'en Haut; twenty at the Fortress of Louisbourg, in addition to Louisiana and Acadia. Significant garrisons were held at Quebec, Montreal, and New Orleans, with small forces guarding the forts and posts across the vast territory of the North America during the 18th century.|$|R

5|$|In September 1943, {{he joined}} the Royal Air Force, {{although}} {{it is unclear whether}} he volunteered or was conscripted; his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds. Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties. He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader Ralph Reader's RAF Gang Show entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> was transferred to India. His tour also included Ceylon and Burma, although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers may have exaggerated its length. He also served in Germany and France after the war.|$|E
5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{where he}} {{discovered}} {{that no one would}} employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E

5|$|Roekiah {{insisted on}} {{becoming}} an actress, despite {{the opposition of}} her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with one condition: Roekiah could only perform once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took to {{the stage for the}} first time, Mohammad Ali– unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter– rushed on stage and insisted that Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented. Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with <b>the</b> <b>troupe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sarumpaet, {{born into}} a {{politically}} active Christian family in North Sumatra, initially studied architecture in Jakarta. After seeing a play by Willibrordus S. Rendra in 1969, she dropped out and joined his troupe. Five years later, after marrying and converting to Islam, she founded the Satu Merah Panggung; <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> did mostly adaptations of foreign dramas. As she became increasingly concerned about her marriage and unhappy about the local theatre scene, two years later Sarumpaet left her troupe and began to work in television; she only returned in 1989, after divorcing her abusive husband.|$|E
5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. <b>The</b> <b>troupe</b> managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{with the}} era of the romantic ballet at an end, the {{principal}} personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>troupe</b> began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today.|$|E
5|$|Djajakusuma became {{employed}} at the Cultural Centre {{as a translator}} and actor under Armijn Pane. Among the works he translated were several pieces by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg and Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, {{as well as a}} history of Japan and several kabuki stage plays. While with the Centre, Djajakusuma wrote several of his own stage plays. In his free time, Djajakusuma helped establish the amateur theatre company Maya, together with artists such as HB Jassin, Rosihan Anwar, and Usmar Ismail. <b>The</b> <b>troupe,</b> formed in response to a desire for greater artistic freedom, performed translations of European works and original works by Ismail and El Hakim. To promote a sense of Indonesian nationalism while still conforming with the Japanese censorship bureau's rules, several of Maya's plays did not explicitly promote Japan, but rather the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Themes supporting the Indonesian nationalist movement, meanwhile, remained implicit in the works. With Maya, Djajakusuma travelled from village to village, putting on performances.|$|E
