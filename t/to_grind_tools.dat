40|$|AbstractThe {{machining}} process affects quality {{and function of}} components. For this reason, {{it is an important}} key competence of the manufacturer. Over the past years, counterfeit products have been threatening the user and damaged the reputation of the original manufacturer. On this account, a method of fingerprinting of ground surfaces was developed in the Collaborative Research Center 653 to protect components against plagiarism. However, this method needs the measuring of every single ground surface, which means a huge expenditure of time in the production chain. If it were possible <b>to</b> predict the <b>grinding</b> surface of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> precisely, occasional measurements of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> during the setup time would be sufficient to assign the right tool to the component‘s surface and the manufacturer behind it.

40|$|Modern 5 -axis {{machining}} centers {{enable the}} {{development and use of}} new machining kinematics and <b>grinding</b> strategies <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> workpieces with superabrasives mounted points. One of these technologies is the oscillating surface grinding (OSG), which can improve the surface characteristics and the tribological properties of machined surfaces. In the current contribution could be observed that the resultant surface roughness values by OSG are not constant within a wavelength of oscillation of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool.</b> This leads <b>to</b> further studies of the kinematics involved in this process, resulting {{in the development of a}} new grinding strategy: the tilt surface grinding (TSG). By using TSG, workpiece surfaces with similar characteristics as OSG could be obtained even without aid of oscillation. In this study, experimental tests are carried out to investigate the influence of parameters involved in these strategies. A significant parameter is the tilt angle t, which can be simplified as an angle between the directions of the feed rate in tangential direction vft and the feed rate in axial direction vfa of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool.</b> The tilt angle t is responsible for changes occurred on the OSG when compared <b>to</b> conventional surface <b>grinding.</b> Increasing the tilt angle t, a reduction up to 50 % of the roughness values could be achieved.

40|$|International audienceJabal al ‘Aluya is a Neolithic site {{located at}} the foot of Jabal Salekh near Adam. The site extends over 65 hectares, loosely {{occupied}} with 139 structures and lithic concentrations that were found all over the surface. The numerous cherts (almost bifacial tools) collected from this area date back to the Neolithic. Geomorphological studies show that the site is well preserved despite deflation. Moreover, its location is linked to the presence of water and the site is also close to sources of raw material.

40|$|Forty eight {{patients}} with extensive occupational exposure <b>to</b> pneumatic <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> were evaluated {{at a university}} sponsored occupational health clinic. All patients were interviewed and examined by a physician and assessed neurologically with standard clinical, functional motor, quantitative vibrotactile, and electrodiagnostic tests. Sensorineural symptoms were nearly universal; 47 patients (98 %) reported numbness and tingling of the hands and fingers. Among clinical tests, two point discrimination and 30 Hz vibration perception were most frequently abnormal. In order to evaluate associations between quantitative test results and sensorineural symptoms, patients were stratified into two groups of symptom severity according to a consensus sensorineural staging system. The tests that discriminated best between the groups of more and less symptomatic patients were hand strength dynamometry, and vibrotactile thresholds. Age standardised 120 Hz vibrotactile thresholds were significantly raised in digit II in 41 % of hand measurements. Nerve conduction studies were neither significantly different between more and less symptomatic groups nor correlated with clinical and quantitative sensory tests. Twenty five per cent of the patients had slowing of sensory conduction velocities in the median nerve at the wrist (less than 48 m/s). Of this subset of patients only two showed abnormal slowing of the median nerve distal to the wrist, but half also showed ulnar nerve slowing (less than 47 m/s). This observation highlights the difficulty of differentiating median nerve entrapment from diffuse distal neuropathy in workers exposed to vibration {{and points to the}} need for concomitant quantitative sensory and functional motor assessment...|$|R

5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after <b>grinding,</b> it has <b>to</b> be reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. <b>Grinding</b> <b>tool</b> alignment, <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> referencing and <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> truing {{also have to be}} done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} investigation {{has been carried}} out to develop and describe the distribution of pressure gradient underneath and across the topological surface of laboratory <b>grinding</b> <b>tools.</b> The surface pressure plays a key role during polishing process of ceramic tiles in gloss gaining and development of surface roughness. Analogous to the surface topography changes of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> and ceramic tiles, the wear of the work tools and work pieces are proportional <b>to</b> the <b>grinding</b> work that was performed between the surfaces during the polishing process. The present work intends to evaluate the influence of the gradual distribution of surface pressure in polishing ceramic tiles with line contact. For this purpose, two <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> were assembled together as a polishing head and installed on a CNC tribometer machine with a deflection angle of 2. 2 ° from the base coordinate system of the machine. In this thesis, the theory of pressure distributed gradually underneath and across the polishing tools was successfully defined by implementing a new polishing tool composed of rotating shaft with pivot joint, helical springs and two abrasive blocks attached on it. These findings enhance the understanding of pressure distribution from previous study of polishing with flat contact using single abrasive block. With these comparisons the process outcome in terms of gloss level and fine surface finish could be further optimised. The effect of the material removal and gloss development due to polishing tools configuration with preferred process parameters were found to be minimised or maximised according to the kinematics chosen. Differences were clearly illustrated {{at the end of the}} work...|$|R

Here, we use 3 complementary high-resolution tools to probe aspects {{of the structure of}} the grinding tip: X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy (X-PEEM), X-ray microdiffraction, and NanoSIMS. We confirm that the needles and plates are aligned and show here that even the high Mg polycrystalline matrix constituents are aligned with the other 2 structural elements when imaged at 20 -nm resolution. Furthermore, we show that the entire tooth is composed of 2 cooriented polycrystalline blocks that differ in their orientations by only a few degrees. A unique feature of the grinding tip is that the structural elements from each coaligned block interdigitate. This interdigitation may influence the fracture process by creating a corrugated grinding surface. We also show that the overall Mg content of the tooth structural elements increases toward the grinding tip. This probably contributes to the increasing hardness of the tooth from the periphery to the tip. Clearly the formation of the tooth, and the tooth tip in particular, is amazingly well controlled. The improved understanding of these structural features could lead to the design of better mechanical <b>grinding</b> and cutting <b>tools...</b>|$|R
