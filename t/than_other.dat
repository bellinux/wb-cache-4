5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the small intestine at a rate significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>other</b> breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of inguinal hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater <b>than</b> <b>other</b> breeds. At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of large intestinal obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of laminitis as a medical complication related to the intestinal issues.|$|E
5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller <b>than</b> <b>other</b> tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull <b>than</b> <b>other</b> tyrannosaurids.|$|E

5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} in less time <b>than</b> <b>other</b> radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E

The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates <b>than</b> <b>other</b> members of the genus.|$|E

5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation <b>than</b> <b>other</b> breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
