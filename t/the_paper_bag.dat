At about 1:10a.m. on July 29, 1976, Donna Lauria, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, 19, were sitting in Valenti's Oldsmobile, discussing their evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque. Lauria {{opened the car door}} to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, [...] "Now what is this..." [...] The man produced a pistol from <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> that he carried and crouched. He braced one elbow on his knee, aimed his weapon with both hands, and fired. Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly. Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women. The shooter turned and walked away quickly, without saying a word.|$|E

50|$|Knight {{moved to}} Springfield, Massachusetts in 1867 and {{was hired by}} <b>the</b> Columbia <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Company. In 1868, Knight invented a machine that folded and glued <b>paper</b> to form <b>the</b> {{flat-bottomed}} brown <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> familiar to shoppers today. Knight built a wooden model of the device, but needed a working iron model {{to apply for a}} patent. Charles Annan, who was in the machine shop where Knight's iron model was being built, stole her design and patented the device. Knight filed a successful patent interference lawsuit and was awarded the patent in 1871. With a Massachusetts business partner, Knight established <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Co. and received royalties.|$|R
50|$|Colorism is not {{a synonym}} to racism as colorism can occur, and often does, within racial and ethnic groups. <b>The</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test was used in America for black people to be further divided: those lighter than a brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were allotted some {{privilege}} that those darker were not permitted to. <b>The</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test and colorism add to the fuel of intersectionality: recognizing the different identities of an individual {{in order to better}} understand one's lived experiences which can be different by race, gender, sexuality, as well as color, amongst other qualities. <b>The</b> brown <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> test is not used outright today but there are still implications of colorism; for example in media, lighter skin black females are often more sexualized than their darker counterparts.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Brown <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Test was a type {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in the United States.

In addition, brown <b>paper</b> <b>bags</b> were used in multi-racial social events. The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification within the African-American population. <b>The</b> Brown <b>Paper</b> <b>Bag</b> Test arose from the practice of discrimination based on skin color.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Mathers, J.

He had very often seen that cigar-box with a Havana brand, which he himself had brought {{from the other room}} after the Registrar had emptied it, passed around with six cigars, no more nor less, and he was wise enough to know that the Shipwreck Clerk did not expect to supply him with smoking-material. If that gentleman had offered to the friends who generally dropped in on him on Wednesday afternoon <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> of cigars sold at five cents each when bought singly, but half a dozen for a quarter of a dollar, they would have been quite as thankfully received; but it better pleased his deprecative soul to put them in an empty cigar-box, and thus throw around them the halo of the presumption that ninety-four of their imported companions had been smoked.|$|E
60|$|Pollie bustled downstairs. I {{stood in}} the midst of the sunlit, {{dismantled}} room, light and shadow at play upon ceiling and walls, the sun-pierced air a silvery haze of dust. A host of memories and thoughts, like a procession in a dream, traversed my mind. A strangeness, too--as if even this novel experience of farewell was a vague recollection beyond defined recall. Pollie returned with the new hat in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> in which she had brought it from home: and I was her looking-glass when she had put it on. Then from top to basement she carried me through every room in the house, and there on the kitchen floor, mute witness of the past, lay the beetle-gnawn remnant of my candle-stub. We wandered through the garden, glinting green in the cool flocking sunbeams after the rain; and already vaunting its escape from Man. Pollie was returning to Lyndsey--I not! My heart was too full to let me linger by the water. I gazed at the stones and the wild flowers in a sorrowful hunger of farewell. Trifles, soon to be dying, how lovely they were. The thought of it swallowed me up. What was the future but an emptiness? Would that I might vanish away and be but a portion of the sweetness of the morning. Even Pollie's imperturbable face wore the appearance of make-believe; for an instant I surprised the whole image of me reflected in her round blue eye.|$|E

50|$|Although {{breathing}} into a {{paper bag}} was a common recommendation for short-term treatment of symptoms of an acute panic attack, it has been criticized as inferior to measured breathing, potentially worsening the panic attack and possibly reducing needed blood oxygen. While <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> technique increases needed carbon dioxide and so reduces symptoms, it may excessively lower oxygen levels in the blood stream. To make matters worse, several studies show a link between panic attacks and the abrupt increase in CO2 from <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> method: Use of <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> method may worsen feelings of panic in patients who might otherwise use measured breathing techniques with success.|$|E
