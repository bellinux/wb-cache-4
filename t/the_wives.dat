The Dutch Order of Weavers admits only <b>the</b> <b>wives,</b> while in the American orders {{the men and women}} share in the ritual. Like the lodges of adoption, they have their own ceremonies, which means that some grand lodges view them as irregular.|$|E

These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of <b>the</b> <b>wives</b> of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E

40|$|We examine {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of relative income within households. We show that {{the distribution of the}} share of income earned by <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> exhibits a sharp drop to the right of 1 2, where <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> income exceeds <b>the</b> husband’s income. We argue that this pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which induce an aversion to a situation where <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> earns more than her husband. We present evidence that this aversion also impacts marriage forma-tion, <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> labor force participation, <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. Within marriage mar-kets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline. In couples where <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> potential income is likely to exceed <b>the</b> husband’s, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> is less likely to be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work. In couples where <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> earns more than <b>the</b> husband, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> spends more time on household chores; moreover, those couples are less satisfied with their marriage {{and are more likely to}} divorce. These patterns hold both cross-sectionally and within couples over time...|$|R

5|$|In 1940, Tang Shengming {{surrendered}} to the Japanese and was recruited {{to serve in the}} Reorganized National Government of China (the Wang Jingwei regime), a puppet government established by Japan in occupied Nanking.

5|$|Other divinities also employ {{surrogate}}s to {{meet their}} own needs. In the Puranas, Sati commits suicide by immolating herself when Shiva is insulted and is reborn as Parvati and becomes Shiva's consort again. In a later Sanskrit text, Sati creates a surrogate who burns herself, while the real Sati is reborn as Parvati. In the Mahabharata, the goddess Svaha assumes the form of six of <b>the</b> <b>wives</b> of the Saptarishi (seven great sages), with whom Agni is in love with, and has coitus with him.

40|$|We examine {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of relative income within households. We establish that gender identity – in particular, an aversion to <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> earning more than the husband-impacts marriage formation, <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> labor force participation, <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. The distribution of the share of household income earned by <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> exhibits a sharp cliff at 0. 5, which suggests that a couple is less willing to match if her income exceeds his. Within marriage markets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline. Within couples, if <b>the</b> <b>wife’s</b> potential income (based on her demographics) is likely to exceed <b>the</b> husband’s, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> {{is less likely to}} be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work. Couples where <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> earns more than the husband are less satisfied with their marriage {{and are more likely to}} divorce. Finally, based on time use surveys, the gender gap in non-market work is larger if <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> earns more than the husband...|$|R

5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on the bodies of <b>the</b> <b>wives,</b> Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands {{to get close to}} <b>the</b> <b>wives,</b> using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E

50|$|Among these sights {{the best}} known is Dodam Sambong (3 Peak Island), {{representing}} the typical love triangle of ancient Korea: a husband, {{his wife and his}} mistress. The biggest peak, about 20 feet high with a pavilion on top, in the middle represents the husband, while the first smaller peak {{on one side of the}} husband is <b>the</b> <b>wife.</b> On <b>the</b> other side the smallest peak is the mistress. According to legend, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> was not able to give birth to a son, so the husband found a mistress to produce a son. <b>The</b> <b>wife</b> was upset, which is why <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> peak is farther from the husband than the mistress.
