5|$|Many {{immigrants}} openly flouted Mexican law, {{especially the}} prohibition against slavery.

Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended.

5|$|Despite her out-dated design, Démocratie {{served with}} the French Mediterranean Fleet {{throughout}} her career, including during World War I.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{judicial}} <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic rights {{remains a}} challenge in many countries. This is generally attributable to the inadequacy of a particular country’s legal framework, in particular its constitutional framework. Given the importance of judicial remedies in litigation, in particular public interest litigation, this article considers possibilities for <b>the</b> judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic rights in Botswana. It discusses the institutional, legal and constitutional framework for the promotion, protection and fulfilment of socio-economic rights in the country. It also tackles the issue ofwhether <b>the</b> judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic rights is easily achievable when those rights are not constitutionally entrenched. The article also considers whether the absence of directive principles of state policy within Botswana’s Constitution is a hindrance to <b>the</b> judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic rights in Botswana. Within that context, it highlights the possible means <b>of</b> judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic rights in Botswana.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the question to}} what extent and how European and Dutch competition law can be enforced using private law techniques within the Dutch legal system.

Chapter 3 considers the main points of the question how <b>the</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> competition law works. Chapter 4 explores {{the contours of the}} different options and developments in <b>the</b> private law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> competition law. Chapter 5 examines the evolution of the role played by the national court in <b>the</b> private law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> competition law. Chapter 6 explores the arbitrator’s role in <b>the</b> private law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> competition law. Chapter 7 reviews the award of damages on account of breach of competition law. Chapter 8 examines the role played by collective actions in <b>the</b> private law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> competition law. Chapter 9 explores evidentiary problems in <b>the</b> private law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> competition law and the possible solutions.

5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> the local laws on miners and metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.|$|E

Of these Aeronautica Militare Tornados and AMX fighter-bombers released 550 guided bombs and missiles, and Italian Navy AV-8Bs delivered 160 guided bombs.

These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans {{have been killed by}} extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships as a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E
