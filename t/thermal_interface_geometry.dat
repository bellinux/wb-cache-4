40|$|Abstract- <b>Thermal</b> <b>interface</b> {{material}} (TIM) is used {{to enhance}} heat flow by reducing thermal resistance across the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> between the heat source and the heat sink, and to minimize the variance of the interface resistance as compared to just surface-tosurface contact. In this mini review, the recent developments in the thermal properties of various used and advanced <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials are discussed with the new technologies employed for improving the performance of TIMs. Also, a brief account of the applications of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials is presented...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{management}} of electronic products {{relies on the}} effective dissipation of heat. This {{can be achieved by}} the optimisation of the system design with the help of simulation methods. The precision of these models relies also on the used material data. For the determination of this data an experimental set-up for a static measurement is presented, which evaluate thermal conductivity of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials (e. g adhesive, solder, foils, or pastes). It is common practice for high power applications to assemble power devices as bare dies in chip on board technique or to use flip chip assemblies with a directly mounted copper or aluminium heatsink. The thermal resistance of the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material is the bottleneck of the thermal heat flow from the active device junction to the cooler. All the more important is the fact of strongly localised hot spots, as heat spreading requires better <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials as just heat-transfer. If possible, it is useful and common to reduce the thickness of the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material. But for thinner <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistance (between the silicon and the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material as well as between the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material and the cooler material) is no longer negligible. Therefore it is essential to account for this effect in the measurement set-up. Common measurement techniques place the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material between two copper plates, heating the plate above and cooling the plate below. In this set-up the heat flow through the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material is supposed to equal the electrical power loss. The thickness of the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material is some millimetres. This approach does not account for size effects and interface resistances occurring in real set-ups. Therefore a more accurate measurement set-up is constructed and presented. This set-up contains in situ measurement of applied force, the measurement is using interfaces as in real power assembly (same interface resistance) and is universal useable for application of all marketgoing <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials. A range of different interface materials is characterised with varying thickness. Thus the thermal conductivity of the materials and the interface resistance is characterised. It is shown that the interface material can become a key issue for the thermal {{management of}} dynamically loaded devices. On this example a model with statically determined material data is validated and discussed in simulation and experiment. The paper gives an overview over the set-up and the measurement technique and discusses experimental and simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Thermal design {{requirements}} are mostly {{driven by the}} peak temperatures. Reducing or eliminating hot spots could alleviate the design requirement for the whole package. Combination of solid-state and liquid cooling will allow removal of both hot spots and background heating. In this paper, we analyze the performance of thin film Bi 2 Te 3 microcooler and the 3 D SiGe based microrefrigerator and optimize the maximum cooling and cooling power density {{in the presence of}} flow. Liquid flow and heat transfer coefficient will change the background temperature of the chip but they also affect the performance of the solid-state coolers used to remove hot spots. Both Peltier cooling at interfaces and Joule heating inside the device could be affected by the fluid flow. We analyze conventional Peltier coolers as well as 3 D coolers. We study the impact of various parameters such as thermoelectric leg thickness, <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistances, and <b>geometry</b> factor on the overall system performance. We find that the cooling of conventional Peltier cooler is significantly reduced in the presence of fluid flow. On the other hand, 3 D SiGe can be effective to remove high power density hot spots up to 500 W/cm. 3 D microrefrigerators can have a significant impact if the thermoelectric figure-of-merit, ZT, could reach 0. 5 for a material grown on silicon substrate. It {{is interesting to note that}} there is an optimum microrefrigerator active region thickness that gives the maximum localized cooling. For liquid heat transfer coefficient between 5000 and 20000 W/m/K, the optimum is found to be between 10 and 20 Âµm. 1...|$|R

40|$|Understanding <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> {{conductance}} {{is important}} for nanoscale systems where interfaces can {{play a critical role}} in heat transport. In this thesis, pump and probe transient thermoreflectance methods are used to measure the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> conductance between solid materials. Two experimental studies of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> conductance are presented, each revealing the complexity of phonon interactions at interfaces which are inadequately captured by current models of phonon transmissivity. The first study considers interfaces of different metals with graphite, and finds that atomic-scale roughness at the interface could be appreciably influencing the heat transport due to the extreme anisotropy of graphite. The <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> conductance of graphite is found to be similar to that of diamond, suggesting that when estimating the <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> conductance between metal and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), a reasonable assumption may be that the conductance with the side walls of the MWCNTs is similar to the conductance with the ends of the MWCNTs. The second study considered aluminum on diamond interfaces where the diamond samples were functionalized to have different chemical surface terminations. The surface termination of the diamond is found to significantly influence the heat flow, with oxygenated diamond, which is hydrophilic, exhibiting four times higher <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> conductance than hydrogen-treated diamond, which is hydrophobic. Microstructure analysis determined that the Al film formed similarly, independent of diamond surface termination, suggesting that differences in interface bonding likely caused the observed difference in <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> conductance, a phenomenon which is not captured in current models of solid-solid phonon transmissivity. by Kimberlee Chiyoko Collins.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityThis work {{presents}} the fabrication and characterization of MEMS <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials. Different materials {{were used to}} fabricate and characterize different configurations of sample <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials. The materials used as <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials are vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT), mercury and glycerin. VACNT turfs were fabricated on 4 x 4 mm 2 silicon substrates using a chemical vapor deposition process (CVD). The process of thermocompression bonding of VACNT to metallized substrates was used to fabricate a low-resistance <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material. The resulting structures consisted of a VACNT turf sandwiched between two metallized silicon substrates. Both full coverage turfs and patterned turfs were tested. In addition to the initial as grown and the final bonded structures, intermediate structures resulting from {{the steps of the}} thermocompression bonding process were tested. A total of seven configuration of VACNT turfs were tested. A <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistance as low as 4. 36 mm 2 K/W was measured for the patterned turf, while it was 108. 2 mm 2 K/W for the full coverage turf. Mercury micro droplet arrays of two sizes were fabricated and characterized. Mercury arrays were fabricated by preferentially condensing mercury vapor on micromachined gold targets. The arrays included a 40 x 40 array (1600 grid) and two 20 x 20 arrays (400 grid). Similar to the VACNT turfs, the mercury arrays were assembled on 4 x 4 mm 2 silicon substrate. A <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistance as low as 0. 253 mm 2 K/W was measured for the mercury arrays. A model to predict the thermal resistance of liquid-metal micro droplet arrays was presented and compared to the experimental results. Based on the experimental results and modeled data, an average contact resistance between the mercury arrays and silicon substrates of 0. 14 mm 2 K/W was estimated. Glycerin droplets, 1 ÂµL, were also tested as <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials. Copper nanoparticles having a diameter of 25 nm were dispersed in glycerin at different volume fractions to enhance its thermal conductivity. An increase of 57. 5 % in the thermal conductivity of glycerin was measured at a volume fraction of 15 %. A minimum <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistance of 30. 37 mm 2 K/W was measured for the glycerin micro droplets. The effect of nanoparticles size on the effective thermal conductivity of glycerin was studied. Nanoparticles with diameters of 60 - 80 nm and 300 nm were dispersed in glycerin at a volume fraction of 5 %, and their results were compared to those of the 25 nm particles. The <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistance of glycerin micro droplet arrays was then predicted for different volume fractions of copper nanoparticles.

Various types of interfaces were designed, to investigate how different <b>interface</b> <b>geometries</b> influence distribution of stress and strain under shear loading. The <b>interface</b> <b>geometries</b> examined in this paper included castle interface, dent interface, honeycomb interface and chase interface.

To apply the shear loading, two locations were considered for each of the geometries. These locations differed depending on the interface features. Stress and strain distribution and values across different <b>interface</b> <b>geometries</b> were analysed with the aid of 3 D Finite Element Method (FEM). The numerical simulations indicated that stress and strain magnitudes and distribution patterns varied in relation to different geometries. Some substrates showed relatively lower plastic strain representing higher durability of the geometries.

40|$|Heat {{conduction}} {{plays an}} important role in the efficiency and life span of electronic components. To keep electronic components running efficiently and at a proper temperature, thermal management systems transfer heat generated from the components to thermal surfaces such as heat sinks, heat pipes, radiators, or heat spreaders. Thermal surfaces absorb the heat from the electrical components and dissipate it into the environment, preventing overheating. To ensure the best contact between electrical components and <b>thermal</b> surfaces, <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials are applied. In addition to having high conductivity, ideal <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials should be compliant to conform to the components, increasing the surface contact.

40|$|As part of {{investigations}} into improving <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> performance for polymeric, particle-filled <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials, this work has accomplished {{a number of}} useful steps towards better <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> designs for electronic systems. Amongst original contributions, a non-contact, relatively easy-to-recreate experimental methodology for measuring bond-line thickness in electronic systems is developed and described {{in order to allow}} for experimental evaluation of designs. Perhaps more importantly, the apparatus can be used for characterization of <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> material constitutive behavior for use in performance predictive models, and this functionality is demonstrated with a common TIM. ^ Another novel contribution is the development of a reduced-order model based on a resistance network for simulating squeeze flow between parallel plates that are separated by distances common in <b>thermal</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Individual resistances are computed based on smaller squeeze flow sub-problems which are then linked together with appropriate conservation equations to simulate the entire set of parallel plates. This reduced-order model allows for efficient evaluation of performance of heat spreader designs, and is extendable to many relevant fluid constitutive behavior models. The model lends itself to efficient analytical sensitivity analysis, which can be used for design analysis and optimization. ^ The assumption of Newtonian fluid in the system simulation, along with its sensitivity analysis, is used in order to generate optimal designs in a Pareto optimal framework that weighs a measure of thermal resistance performance against squeezing flow pressure, in order to explore the tradeoffs between the conflicting objectives to find optimal designs. Families of optimal designs are generated, depending on above-stated user preference as well as initial conditions, since the design space as formulated contains local minima. The design space for the Newtonian system is explored in order to determine factors that affect performance in the various objective function metrics. Finally, the optimization framework-generated designs are compared to ad-hoc designs similar to those in literature. ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} methods to enhance CNT <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> {{performance}} by engineering the array {{in terms of}} volume fraction as well as develop innovative bonding techniques at a CNT/substrate contact. In particular, unbonded, semi-bonded, and fully bonded CNT TIMs are fabricated and thermally characterized using transient PA and a steady state 1 D reference bar techniques. The main objective of this work is to mitigate the phonon `bottleneck 2 Ì 7 at solid-solid contacts by means of increasing the area of contact and moving towards more covalently bonded interfaces. Because of their extraordinarily high thermal conductivities and mechanical conformability, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offer a compelling alternative to traditional <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials in electronics packages. The conformability feature is particularly advantageous in addressing CTE mismatch under extreme thermal conditions encountered in advanced electronics applications. Prior results for dry CNT array <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> materials compare very favorably with state-of-the-art thermal greases and other non-bonded materials. The <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> behavior of CNT-coated Cu foils and the commensurate effects {{of a wide range of}} synthesis parameters are reported in this thesis. The results indicate that low <b>thermal</b> <b>interface</b> resistance values are possible for solder-enhanced interposers with and without the inclusion of paraffin wax, reaching levels below 10 mm^ 2 K/W as measured by the one-dimensionalreference bar technique. General observations from parametric variations such as CNT array height and volume fraction on interface resistance measured by the reference bar technique are complemented by a photoacoustic method for unbonded, partially-bonded and fully-bonded interfaces. Lastly, an innovative bonding technique that utilizes a metal-orgranic precursor to create a palladium (Pd) bond at the MWCNT/Ag interface is shown to be a promising avenue with thermal resistances measuring near 5 mm^ 2 K/W by PA and 25 mm^ 2 K/W by referencebar. ...|$|R
