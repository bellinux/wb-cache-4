40|$|Abstract—In <b>topic</b> tracking, a <b>topic</b> {{is usually}} {{described}} by several stories. How {{to represent a}} <b>topic</b> is always an issue and a difficult problem in the research on <b>topic</b> tracking. To emphasis the <b>topic</b> in stories, we provide an improved topicbased tf*idf weighting method to measure the topical importance of the features in the representation model. To overcome the <b>topic</b> drift problem and filter the noise existed in the tracked <b>topic</b> description, a dynamic <b>topic</b> model is proposed based on the static model. It extends the initial <b>topic</b> model with {{the information from the}} incoming related stories and filters the noise using the latest unrelated story. The <b>topic</b> tracking systems are implemented on the TDT 4 Chinese corpus. The experimental results indicate that both the new weighting method and the dynamic model can improve the tracking performance.

40|$|This {{paper is}} to specify the <b>topic</b> opening markers by Japanese native speakers. The data consist of eleven audio- and video-taped 20 -minute dyadic Japanese conversations. The {{analysis}} focused upon a variety of the <b>topic</b> opening markers, their frequency, and correlations between them and types of <b>topic</b> shift. As a result, six kinds of <b>topic</b> opening markers were observed. They function as: 1) making <b>topic</b> conspicuous, 2) showing change of recognition, 3) showing hesitation in speech, 4) connecting, 5) meta-language, and 6) calling names. In order to analyze the tendency of usage in <b>topic</b> opening markers {{depending on the type}} of <b>topic</b> shift, all the <b>topic</b> shifts were divided into two types: continuous shift and discontinuous shift. As for the rate of occurrence of <b>topic</b> opening markers, it became clear that more <b>topic</b> opening markers occur in discontinuous shift. As for each <b>topic</b> opening marker, the marker showing change of recognition was only notably higher in discontinuous shift than in continuous shift. No difference was clearly seen in the other <b>topic</b> opening markers. These results show that Japanese speakers us e <b>topic</b> opening markers to show their considerations for their counterparts, the uncertainty, and hesitation to introduce a <b>topic</b> by him/herself...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that there}} are three {{distinct}} constructions in Modern German in which a 'topic constituent' is detached to the left: (left-) dislocated <b>topic</b> ('left dislocation'), (left-) attached <b>topic</b> ('mixed left dislocation'), and (left-) hanging <b>topic</b> ('hanging topic'). Presupposing the framework of Integrational Linguistics, I provide syntactic and semantic analyses for them. In particular, I propose that these constructions involve the syntactic function (syntactic) <b>topic,</b> which relates the <b>topic</b> constituent to the remaining part of the sentence. Dislocated and attached <b>topic</b> constituents function in addition as a strong or weak (syntactic) antecedent of some resumptive 'd-pronoun' form. Dislocated <b>topic,</b> attached <b>topic,</b> and hanging <b>topic</b> are in turn contrasted with 'free topics'. Being sentential units of their own, the latter are syntactically unconnected to the following sentence. In particular, they are not <b>topic</b> constituents...|$|R
