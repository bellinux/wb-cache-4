5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity.

5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether {{the total number of}} electors registered to vote overseas is less than <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

5|$|By 1878 Warbrick {{had left}} both St Stephen's and Ponsonby and was {{employed}} as a public servant.

By 1879 he was living in Wellington, and represented the provincial team three times that season. He played three further matches for Wellington in 1880, including one against his old province of Auckland. The 1880 match, the first in Auckland for Wellington, was won by the visitors 4–0. Warbrick was renowned for his drop-kicking, and his goal in the match was the only score; many Aucklanders claimed that his performance was <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sides.|$|E

For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL...

5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of}} the common brown lemur (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One {{solution}} to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|Surge can be {{measured}} directly at coastal tidal stations as <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of sensors can be placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.|$|E
