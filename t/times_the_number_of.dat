5|$|It was {{designed}} to replace the galleys {{that made up the}} core of the fleets that operated along the coasts and in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. The turuma had a bigger draft, was somewhat slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for its crew, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both smaller and more manoeuvrable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E
5|$|The AW101 is {{equipped}} with the Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles. As part of the Royal Navy's Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and weather radar. Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the AQS901 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines.

5|$|The British mustered an {{overwhelming}} force under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and Lieutenant-General George Beckwith, who collected 29 ships and 10,000 men – almost four <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> French regular forces garrisoning Martinique. Landing {{in force on}} both the southern and northern coasts of the island, British troops pushed inland, defeating French regulars in the central highlands and routing local militia units {{in the south of}} the island. By 9 February, the entire island was in British hands except Fort Desaix, a powerful position intended to protect the capital Fort-de-France, which had been bypassed during the British advance. In a siege lasting 15 days the Fort was constantly bombarded, the French suffering 200 casualties before finally surrendering.|$|E
5|$|The chefs were {{initially}} {{surprised at how}} busy they were at lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give the chefs a break.

White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La Tante Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for six days a week, expecting similar hours from those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Council was changed several <b>times.</b> <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926. Werner Dankwort of Germany pushed for his country to join the League; joining in 1926, Germany became the fifth permanent member of the Council. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven, and the Soviet Union was made a permanent member giving the Council a total of fifteen members. The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.|$|E

5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Scotland {{probably}} had about {{one quarter of the}} population of England, it had three <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This was about four times the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed {{as a result of these}} trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and 1649–50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.|$|E
5|$|From late Medieval Scotland {{there is}} {{evidence}} of occasional prosecutions of individuals for causing harm through witchcraft, but these may have been declining {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century. In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made witchcraft a capital crime. Despite the fact that Scotland probably had about one quarter of the population of England, it had three <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> witchcraft prosecutions, at about 6,000 for the entire period. James VI's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch hunts, may have encouraged an interest in the study of witchcraft. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and, inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. After 1599, his views became more sceptical.|$|E

5|$|In June 2011, the NY Waterway-operated East River Ferry line started operations.

The ferry, {{an alternative to the}} New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular, with two to six <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passengers that the city predicted would ride the ferries. From June to November 2011, the ferry accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to a projection of 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, the ferry saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews in Albania {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Jews that were living in the country in 1939. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews in Albania decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, Albania eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel. From December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E

The following week, the episode that concluded the two-parter picked up viewers, reaching an estimated total of 206,000. Brioux commented again about Degrassi: The Next Generation still being on the schedules, wondering when CTV was going to announce its cancellation and noting that The Amazing Race, which follows it in the scheduling, was watched by ten <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Degrassis viewers.

5|$|Rocksteady decided {{early on}} in {{development}} to make Arkham Knight only for the then-upcoming next-generation of consoles, which was considered {{to allow them to}} focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate the older generation systems. The game allows for up to five <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> on-screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City, and riots can feature up to fifty on-screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items, and spray graffiti. The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine, where previous installments had used pre-rendered videos to compensate. Describing the scale of difference between Arkham Knight and earlier games, lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylums environment. Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth, such as Batman's cape, react realistically to movement or wind. Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady's concept for the game, but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games, so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel, Arkham Origins, to fill the gap.|$|E
