5|$|The series {{follows a}} tragic course in which Dream, having {{learned a great}} deal from his imprisonment, tries to correct the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done wrong in the past. Ultimately, this causes him to mercy kill his own son, which leads to his own death {{at the hands of the}} Furies. Dream, having found himself a {{replacement}} early on in Daniel Hall, dies in issue No. 69 (July 1995). The remaining issues deal with Dream's funeral, Hob Gadling choosing to remain immortal in spite of Dream's death, and two stories from the past. The series wraps with the story of William Shakespeare creating his other commission for Dream, The Tempest, his last work not in collaboration with other writers.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
25|$|His {{views on}} {{language}} are polemical {{in their approach}} to word and structure formation. Stavans believes that dictionaries and language academies are buffers whose improbable function is to provide continuity for a language but suggests that such continuity, especially {{in the age of}} electronic communication, is fatuous. He accuses the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language in Madrid of colonialism, among other <b>things.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> also studied the Iberian conquest of the Americas in the 16th century from a linguistic perspective. Translation, for Stavans, represents appropriation. He defined modernity as “a translated way of life” and has written and lectured on the role translators perform as communicating vessels across epochs and habitats.|$|E
50|$|Ace {{wrote one}} screenplay, I Married a Woman, in 1957. Calling {{it the best}} <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever written, but the worst <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever seen after viewing the film, Ace never tried his hand at screenwriting again. When the couple's Miami hotel room was robbed in 1966, Ace managed to find humor in the situation.|$|R

25|$|Pelléas arrives {{alone at}} the well. He is worried that he has become deeply {{involved}} with Mélisande and fears the consequences. He knows he must leave but first, {{he wants to see}} Mélisande one last time and tell her <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> kept to himself. Mélisande arrives. She was able to slip out without Golaud's noticing. At first she is distant but when Pelléas tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, Mélisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pelléas hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but Mélisande says that it is for the better. Pelléas is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, Mélisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has been watching the couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pelléas with his sword and kills him. Mélisande is also wounded but she flees into the woods saying to a dying Pelléas that she does not have courage.|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy was kept a secret, {{with the character}} only being referred to in scripts as [...] "Admiral". While Roddenberry had wanted Kelley to appear, {{he thought that the}} actor would turn him down. The two had lunch together and Roddenberry suggested the appearance, with Kelley agreeing not only to appear, but also that he wouldn't take anything more than the Screen Actor's Guild base salary for the part. He later said, [...] "I just wanted scale, to let it be my way of saying thank you to Gene for the many good <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done for me".|$|E
500|$|His Glasgow {{connections}} and political profile were already well-established enough that in 1174 Jocelin succeeded Enguerrand as Glasgow's bishop. As Bishop of Glasgow, {{he was a}} royal official. In this capacity he travelled [...] abroad on several occasions, and performed the marriage ceremony between King William the Lion and Ermengarde de Beaumont, later baptising their son, the future King Alexander II. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been credited by modern historians as [...] "the founder of the burgh of Glasgow and initiator of the Glasgow fair", {{as well as being}} one of the greatest literary patrons in medieval Scotland, commissioning the Life of St Waltheof, the Life of St Kentigern and the Chronicle of Melrose.|$|E

500|$|Pelinka is {{well known}} as the agent of Kobe Bryant, who retired {{at the end of}} the [...] after 20 seasons as a {{perennial}} All-Star guard for the Los Angeles Lakers. In fact, some of his other clients have hired him because of this. [...] During the 2003 sexual assault case against Bryant, Pelinka spent a considerable amount of time with his client. [...] He accompanied him on trips to Eagle, Colorado. [...] It was Pelinka who confirmed the news of Bryant's second child. [...] In 2004, when Bryant was a free agent, Pelinka confirmed Bryant would remain in Los Angeles with either the Lakers or the Los Angeles Clippers while rumors were flying that he was going to sign with the Chicago Bulls. [...] Subsequently, when Rudy Tomjanovich was hired to be the Lakers' head coach, he sent free agent Bryant and Pelinka a video package describing the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done for players at Bryant's position. [...] A few days later, Pelinka negotiated a contract for Bryant to remain with the Lakers for $136.4 million over seven years. [...] When Bryant demanded to be traded during the 2007 offseason, Pelinka confirmed that [...] "Kobe would like to be moved." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth {{knew exactly what he was}} doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] If he goes on that trip it will be one of the sorriest <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ever done." [...] By one account, Yankees co-owner Colonel Tillinghast Huston attempted to dissuade Ruth as he departed, only to be told by the ballplayer, [...] "Aw, tell the old guy to jump in a lake." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Wale and Gaga, songwriters {{who worked}} on [...] "Chillin" [...] {{included}} Gary De Carlo, Dale Frashuer, Roy C Hammond, Paul Leka, Andre Christopher Lyon, Makeba Riddick, Kirk Robinson and Marcello Valenzano. [...] "Chillin" [...] has influence of 1990s style rapping, and samples from the 1969 song [...] "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" [...] by Steam, and the 1987 song [...] "Top Billin'" [...] by Audio Two. The song is written in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 100 beats per minute, and is composed in the key of G minor. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club called it a [...] "throwback slab of electro-funk", with robotic new wave inspired vocals by Gaga. After starting with the Steam sample, the song has a stripped-down beat with a bass drum and synth-claps, and synthesizers on the verses and the sample being looped in the chorus, with Gaga interjecting her verses in-between. Lyrically it has Wale's name repeated throughout and the rapper talking about <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> in comparison to other people, opening with the line [...] "This how you start off '09, kickin' {{in the door and}} I'm everybody's problem". He also refers to fellow rapper M.I.A. with the line [...] "I'm the same way, M.I.A./ Me, Cool and Dre get high like planes".|$|E

500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E
500|$|Don't Look Now {{has been}} much admired by and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E

2500|$|This {{music and}} the orchestral setting given it is {{surprisingly}} creditable for a first work, and the credit is divided about equally between the things the composer has done and the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> refrained from doing.

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued and {{unsettled}} whether any English Churchman in the 13th century would have disputed that the Pope {{was the head of}} the Universal Church.

Bracton, being both a lawyer and a cleric wrote of the Pope [...] "in spiritualibus super omnibus habet ordinariam jurisdictionem" [...] (In spiritual <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an ordinary jurisdiction over all men in his realm.) Not only was the Pope a law giver, but he was also a judge, and in his Curia, could enforce his decrees.

She is initially cool towards Don Draper, who bristles at her assertive, independent image, but they warm to each other and eventually begin an affair. In the course of their affair, Don tells her <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not shared with Midge Daniels (his previous mistress) or his wife. When Don is blackmailed by Pete Campbell, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he didn't want to run away with her, he simply wanted to run away. Ironically, her calling him a coward and urging him to think more clearly inspires him to persuade Pete to stand down. The relationship seems to collapse from that point on, and Cooper complains to Don about how upset he has made her. Don and Rachel end the affair at some point {{between the first and second}} seasons. He encounters her again in Season 2 while out to eat with Bobbie Barrett, finding out that Rachel has moved on and married a man named Tilden Katz. Though it appears that Don is only momentarily shaken by the news of her marriage, several episodes later, after drinking heavily with Roger and Freddie Rumsen, he gives his name as [...] "Tilden Katz" [...] to the bouncer of an underground club Roger is trying to get them into. In Season 7, Don sees Rachel in a vision while auditioning actresses for a fur commercial, but when he attempts to contact her, he learns that Rachel had two children and that she died from leukemia.|$|E
