25|$|Other manga {{works in}} Algeria employ a similar strategy: authors attempt {{to expand the}} {{resonance}} of their works by appealing to established tropes within Algerian culture. Fella Matougui's and Salim Brahimi's shōjo manga Nahla et les <b>Touareg</b> (2010), for example, uses the openness of the manga format to present Tuareg culture. Published for the Ahaggar Arts International Festival, celebrating the cultural heritage of this Saharan region, Nahla et les <b>Touareg</b> provides an extremely effective – didactic yet fashionable – mode of transmission of Targui culture to urbanized Algerian youth.|$|E

25|$|Although Slovakia's GDP comes {{mainly from}} the {{tertiary}} (services) sector, the industrial sector also {{plays an important role}} within its economy. The main industry sectors are car manufacturing and electrical engineering. Since 2007, Slovakia has been the world's largest producer of cars per capita, with a total of 1.040.000 cars manufactured in the country in 2016 alone. There are currently three automobile assembly plants: Volkswagen's in Bratislava (models: Volkswagen Up, Volkswagen <b>Touareg,</b> Audi Q7, Porsche Cayenne), PSA Peugeot Citroën's in Trnava (models: Peugeot 208, Citroën C3 Picasso) and Kia Motors' Žilina Plant (models: Kia Cee'd, Kia Sportage, Kia Venga). In 2018, Jaguar Land Rover is set to open the country's fourth automobile assembly plant in Nitra.|$|E
25|$|The {{greenhouse}} gas emission reductions are calculated as a percent reduction based on the combined city/highway fuel economy ratings for both the hybrid and non-hybrid model according to the ratings published in EPA's fuel economy guide available online at www.fueleconomy.gov. The score is measured in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best rating. The scores are assigned in relative terms, then a 10 is assigned to the hybrid with the largest reduction in {{greenhouse gas}} emissions, while a zero is assigned to the hybrid with the smallest reduction. The values assigned to the models are calculated through linear interpolation between the two end points. For purposes of updating the scorecard, if new hybrid models are introduced during the year, the scale has to be re-calculated {{to take account of}} the new arrivals. For the 2011 Scorecard, the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid was rated a 10 while the Volkswagen <b>Touareg</b> Hybrid was rated 0. The Toyota Prius was rated a 9.4.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, {{fighting}} {{shifted to}} Mali, with {{a portion of}} the Tuareg groups which had come under a 2006 ceasefire returning to combat. A swift Malian military response, coupled with the diplomatic intervention of other Malian Tuaregs, led to a new, unofficial ceasefire in December 2007. In April, with the help of Libya, a formal ceasefire was declared, though it was quickly followed by new, retributive attacks from both sides. Resumed diplomatic and military pressure, with the intervention of Algerian diplomacy, brought {{what appeared to be a}} final reintegration of the Malian rebel factions in July 2008, along much the same lines of the 2006 peace plan. After both Libyan and Algerian sponsored peace talks, Malian rebel leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga relocated to Libya and the remaining Malian rebels and government concluded a settlement to the conflict. In December 2008, Ag Bahanga's faction of the ADC (Alliance <b>Touareg</b> Nord Mali pour le Changement—ATNMC) returned to conflict in a series of attacks and counterattacks in the far north. This splinter group, despite a series of daring raids deep into populated areas, were decisively defeated by the Malian Army during January 2009, supported by an increasing number of former rebels. In February 2009, elements surrounding Ag Bahanga again fled Mali for Libya, while both Libya and Algeria pledged support to end rebel attacks and support negotiations. ADC fighters negotiated a return to the disarmament agreed in 2008, and began being processed for integration into the Malian Armed Forces in camps near Kidal.|$|E

2500|$|Volkswagen {{partnered with}} Daimler AG and other {{companies}} to market the BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, {{and other companies}} and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available {{for sale in the}} U.S. are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines. Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel. [...] For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced VW to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a SUV to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the <b>Touareg,</b> made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the Porsche Cayenne and later the Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the <b>Touareg</b> has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass.
