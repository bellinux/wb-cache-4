40|$|Abstract- <b>Text</b> <b>frame</b> {{classification}} {{is needed}} in many applications such as event identification, exact event boundary identification, navigation, video surveillance in multimedia etc. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no methods reported solely dedicated to <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classifications so far. Hence this paper presents a new approach to <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification in video based on capturing local observable edge properties of text frames, by virtue of the strong presence of sharp edges, straight appearances of edges and consistent proximity between edges. The approach initially classifies the blocks of the frame into text blocks and non-text blocks. The true text block is then identified among classified text blocks to detect text frames by the proposed features. If the <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> produces one true text block then it is considered as a <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> otherwise a non-text frame. We evaluate the proposed approach on a large database containing both text and nontext frames and publicly available data at two levels, i. e., estimating recall and precision at the block level and the frame level.

In this research, there is identification of manuscripts that contains Illumination and Illustration in the Sana Pustaka Karaton Surakarta library. In addition, there is a description of the form of Illumination and Illustration from those manuscripts. The significance of this research is to find a distinctive and specific description about Illumination and Illustration java manuscript in the Sana Pustaka Karaton Surakarta library [...] Sana Pustaka Karaton Surakarta library store more than 700 manuscripts. There are few manuscripts bundle, in the one single title of manuscript contain more than one subtitle. Therefore, Sana Pustaka Karaton Surakarta store more than 1450 title. Among those 700 manuscripts, there are 48 title that contains Illumination and Illustration in many form and motif. There are 15 manuscript illuminated, 22 manuscript illustrated, and 11 manuscript are the combination from illumination and illustration. According to the function, there are 3 classification of illuminations: 1) illumination as a <b>text</b> <b>frame.</b> 2) illumination as a text barrier, and 3) illumination as a text ornament. Illumination as a <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> can be classified into: 1) <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> shaped in square, 2) <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> shaped in round, 3) <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> in varied shape.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{multimedia}} retrieval in video, <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification is essential for text detection, event detection, event boundary detection etc. We propose a new <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification method that introduces a combination of wavelet and median-moment with k-means clustering to select probable text blocks among 16 equally sized blocks of a video frame. The same feature combination is used with a new Max-Min Clustering at the pixel level to choose probable dominant text pixels in the selected probable text blocks. For the probable text pixels, a so-called Mutual Nearest Neighbor based Symmetry is explored with a four-quadrant formation centered at the centroid of the probable dominant text pixels to know whether a block is a true text block or not. If a frame produces at least one true text block then it is considered as a <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> otherwise it is a non-text frame. Experimental results on different text and non-text datasets including two public datasets and our own created data show that the proposed method gives promising results in terms of recall and precision at the block and frame levels. Further, we also show how existing text detection methods tend to misclassify non-text frames as text frames in term of recall and precision at both the block and frame levels...|$|E
40|$|The aim of <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> {{classification}} {{technique is}} to label a video frame as text or non-text before text detection and recognition. It {{is an essential}} step prior to text detection because text detection methods assume the input to be a <b>text</b> <b>frame.</b> Consequently, when a non-text frame is subjected to text detection, the precision of the text detection method decreases because of false positives. In this paper a new <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification approach based on component linearity is proposed. The method firstly obtains probable text clusters from the gradient values of the RGB images of an input video frame. The Sobel edges corresponding to the text cluster are then extracted and used for further processing. Next, the method proposes to eliminate false text components before undertaking a linearity check where the linearity of the text components is determined using their centroids in a piece-wise manner. If the components in a frame satisfy the defined linearity condition, then the frame is considered as a text frame; otherwise it is considered as a non-text frame. The proposed method has been tested on standard text and non-text datasets of different orientations to demonstrate that it is independent of orientation. A comparative study with the existing method shows that the proposed method is superior in terms of classification rate and processing time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-This paper proposes {{the use of}} a new {{symmetry}} property {{based on}} proximity of the median moments in the wavelet domain. The method divides a given frame into 16 equally sized blocks to classify the true <b>text</b> <b>frame.</b> The average of high frequency subbands of a block is used for computing median moments to brighten the text pixel in a block of video frame. Then K-means clustering with K= 2 is applied on the median moments of the block to classify it as a probable text block. For classified blocks, average wavelet median moments are computed for a sliding window. We introduce Max-Min cluster to classify the probable text pixel in each probable text block. The four quadrants are formed from the centroid of the probable text pixels. The new concept called symmetry is introduced to identify the true text block based on proximity between probable text pixels in each quadrant. If the frame produces at least one true text block, it is considered as a <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> otherwise a non-text frame. The method is tested on three datasets to evaluate the robustness of the method in classification of text frames in terms of recall and precision. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we address}} two complex issues: 1) <b>Text</b> <b>frame</b> {{classification}} and 2) Multi-oriented text detection in video <b>text</b> <b>frame.</b> We first divide a video frame into 16 blocks and propose {{a combination of}} wavelet and median-moments with k-means clustering at the block level to identify probable text blocks. For each probable text block, the method applies the same combination of feature with k-means clustering over a sliding window running through the block to identify potential text candidates. We introduce a new idea of symmetry on text candidates in each block based on the observation that pixel distribution in text exhibits a symmetric pattern. The method integrates all blocks containing text candidates in the frame and then all text candidates are mapped on to a Sobel edge map of the original frame to obtain text representatives. To tackle the multi-orientation problem, we present a new method called Angle Projection Boundary Growing (APBG) which is an iterative algorithm and works based on a nearest neighbor concept. APBG is then applied on the text representatives to fix the bounding box for multi-oriented text lines in the video frame. Directional information is used to eliminate false positives. Experimental results {{on a variety of}} datasets such as non-horizontal, horizontal, publicly available data (Hua’s data) and ICDAR- 03 competition data (camera images) show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods proposed for video and {{the state of the art}} methods for scene text as well...|$|E

This work {{consists of two}} parts namely automatic classification of text frames from a large database of text and non-text frames and FSF in RGB for text detection in the classified text frames. For <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification, we present novel features based on three visual cues, namely, sharpness in filter-edge maps, straightness of the edges and proximity of the edges to identify a true <b>text</b> <b>frame.</b> For text detection in video frames, we present new Fourier transform based features in RGB space with statistical features and the computed FSF features from RGB bands are subject to K-means clustering to classify text pixels from {{the background of the}} frame. Text blocks of the classified text pixels are determined by analyzing the projection profiles. Finally, we introduce a few heuristics to eliminate false positives from the frame. The robustness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on a variety of frames of low contrast, complex background, different fonts, and sizes of text in the frame. Both our own test dataset and a publicly available dataset are used for the experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to existing approaches in terms of detection rate, false positive rate and misdetection rate...|$|E

One of the areas of poetic language research is actualized – {{the study of the}} potential of parts of speech, that is a marker of the art text pragmatics – imagery, emotion, evaluation, expression. The specific use of numerals is investigated, in particular their artistic expression and significance in the poetic texts of Ivan Drach. The popular belief is refuted that numeral does not have a strong potentiality for active implementation of the functions of art means taking into account the limited semantics and abstracted lexical meaning. Poetic language of Ivan Drach is full of numeral metaphors, similes, implementation of synecdoche, hyperbole, paraphrase and antithesis, besides there is such a phonetic-syntactic figure of <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> as epanafora. The poet models grammatical deviation by violating rules of numerals’ usage. Colloquial and dialect forms are successfully used and occasional formations with the use of numerals are presented in poetic texts of Ivan Drach.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} new {{features}} based on Spatial-Gradient-Features (SGF) at block level for identifying six video scripts namely, Arabic, Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and Tamil. This works helps in enhancing {{the capability of}} the current OCR on video text recognition by choosing an appropriate OCR engine when video contains multi-script frames. The input for script identification is the text blocks obtained by our <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification method. For each text block, we obtain horizontal and vertical gradient information to enhance the contrast of the text pixels. We divide the horizontal gradient block into two equal parts as upper and lower at the centroid in the horizontal direction. Histogram on the horizontal gradient values of the upper and the lower part is performed to select dominant text pixels. In the same way, the method selects dominant pixels from {{the right and the}} left parts obtained by dividing the vertical gradient block vertically. The method combines the horizontal and the vertical dominant pixels to obtain text components. Skeleton concept is used to reduce pixel width to a single pixel to extract spatial features. We extract four features based on proximity between end points, junction points, intersection points and pixels. The method is evaluated on 770 frames of six scripts in terms of classification rate and is compared with an existing method. We have achieved 82. 1 % average classification rate.
