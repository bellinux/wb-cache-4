5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

25|$|On August 7, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> between Batvači, Peroj and Barbariga, in the {{municipality}} of Vodnjan. It was localized around 7:30 PM by a Canadair CL-415 airplane and a helicopter that started extinguishing the fire around 6 PM. The fire, which was spreading {{because of the}} wind and the unapproachable terrain, was extinguished by 90 firefighters and 22 fire engines. The fire burned 80 hectares of forests and brush.|$|E
25|$|By {{different}} owners, {{the main}} house underwent many alterations, and the plantation's acreage was incrementally reduced to 50 acres (20 ha) {{at the time of}} acquisition by the Corporation for Jefferson’s Poplar Forest. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in 1845; the Cobbs and Hutter families chose to rebuild in the Greek revival style and to add an attic story for sleeping; this modified the interior plan of the house. The original walls, chimney, and columns remained after the renovation.|$|E

A small cottage still stood {{in the area of the}} former abbots kitchen when the ruins were placed in the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1933.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, the ground floor of Swem Library {{contained}} the Botetourt Gallery, an auditorium, the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture offices, a rare book room, an honors room, a museum, an audio/visual department, a film preview room, and a faculty lounge. The first floor contained a reserve room, an after-hours reading room, a reference department, and typing and meeting rooms. The second floor contained administration rooms, conference rooms, and stacks. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in the Botetourt Theater in 1972 that destroyed a projection booth. A Micro Computer Lab opened in the library on February 13, 1984.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he got up to some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E

25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967. Don Gregory was running the meeting in the absence of Alan Shepard and so it was he who answered the red phone to be informed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in the Apollo 1 CM. When the enormity of the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{the group}} made a {{decision}} to record together again, with their record company Decca urging a reunion album. London Records decided to release a somewhat poorly mixed eight-year-old recording of the band performing at London's Royal Albert Hall, against their artistic wishes. London/Decca did this in an attempt to re-energise public interest in the Moody Blues before their anticipated new album, but by this time Pinder had remarried and started a family in California, so for their reunion recording, the band decamped stateside with producer Clarke. The sessions were marked with tension and division: first <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> at the studios they were using, then after quickly relocating to Pinder's home studio, a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them, inevitably causing tensions to rise (with Pinder then dropping out before completion).|$|E
25|$|The loyal dog, {{that could}} not wake up his owner but still kept trying to save his life, soaked himself in a nearby stream and {{extinguished}} the fire near Kim. The dog repeated this behavior until he saved Kim's life, but died of burns. Kim woke up after a while and found that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and that his dog was burnt to death near him, but that the grassland on and around which he slept was still wet, safe from the fire. Kim realized what his dog had done for him, cried bitterly, buried his dog in a nearby sunny place, and stuck his walking staff {{in front of the}} grave instead of a tombstone. The story states that the wooden staff became a very large tree after several years, resulting {{in the name of the}} story (the Tree of a Dog). There still stands a huge tree in Osu-Myun to this day, aged about a thousand years.|$|E

25|$|All the city's {{buildings}} {{were made of}} wood, and fire was a great risk. In 1328 nearly the whole city burnt down. The Sint-Bavokerk was severely damaged, and rebuilding {{it would take more}} than 150 years. Again on 12 June 1347 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in the city. A third large fire, in 1351, destroyed many buildings including the Count's castle and the city hall. The Count did not need a castle in Haarlem because his castle in Den Haag had taken over all functions. The Count donated the ground to the city and later a new city hall was built there. The shape of the old city was square—this was inspired by the shape of ancient Jerusalem. After every fire the city was rebuilt quickly, an indication of the wealth of the city in those years. The Black Death came to the city in 1381. According to an estimate by a priest from Leiden the disease killed 5,000 people, about half the population at that time.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s {{featured}} some of {{the most}} prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with Mike Baldwin in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention. The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan. In 1986, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> at the Rovers Return, which attracted an audience of just under 27million, and between 1986 and 1989, the story of Rita Fairclough's psychological abuse at the hands of Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a Blackpool tram, was played out. The episode of Alan's death under the tram gave Coronation Street its highest ratings ever at 26.9million, and it is the ninth-most watched UK broadcast of all time. Other stories included: the birth of Nicky Tilsley in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of Sarah-Louise Tilsley in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.|$|E
25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift {{down the hall toward}} other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms had no way to know that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E

On 2 October 2008, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in a [...] long snow tunnel [...] west of Hallingskeid. Traffic was stopped and {{a combination of a}} fire train and helicopter put out the fire. However, the track and overhead lines past the station were destroyed. The line re-opened on 4 October.|$|E
500|$|During Parry's lifetime, many of {{his works}} {{remained}} unpublished; the shelves of his study held stacks of manuscripts. A friend of Parry's talked with him {{about the possibility of}} losing all of his manuscripts if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and suggested Parry needed a safe to store his manuscripts in. [...] When Parry said he could not afford to buy a safe, the friend gave him one as a gift. Over 100 years after his death, one of his unknown works, Te Deum, was discovered by accident in the National Library of Wales archives.|$|E
500|$|Usher {{supported}} the album with a two-month concert tour called [...] "The Truth Tour". The tour set featured a small stage {{up on top}} of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it—which lowered to the main stage—and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West, who had finished his own headlining tour for his 2004 album The College Dropout, was the opening act for [...] "The Truth Tour".|$|E
