2500|$|Sometime afterward, {{the sons}} of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob {{wanted to know how}} things were doing, so he asked Joseph <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up {{receiving}} came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know what {{you expect me to}} do. You want me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> with a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment. On January26, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him [...] "crazy" [...] during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E

"A {{great deal}} worse, Peter, it's nearly dark already; it will strike eight bells {{in a minute}} or two, and then we shall have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There's</b> no danger, of course, of the ship turning over, but it won't be {{pleasant}} down below. Look out, Peter!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, there's {{plenty of}} room in the after-hatch. But they are sure <b>to</b> <b>go</b> rotten <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Well! I never heard [...] . {{seventeen}} tons! I suppose I must hoist in that lot first thing to- morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head: [...] "I {{had already made}} up my mind <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> that one spot and cut that fiddler out of the running. You can't dare me out of it at this late stage. Besides, there's Mr. O'Hay waiting for you to make your bet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear, do let me go!' said Minnikin; 'I should so like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and amuse {{myself a}} little with the other children.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, but {{how could}} we face the people--I should never be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> And {{most of them have}} such {{enormous}} families." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind. You {{are here}} now. Poor papa, you know, is very ill. Perhaps I may have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> John is there now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know what}} to do fust. The b'ar had me foul, and kept right {{at the bottom of the}} tree all the time. With his wounded leg he couldn't come up, and I didn't dare <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> and <b>there</b> we was--a-lookin' at each other, he a-growlin' and I a-sayin' all kind o' {{unpleasant}} things about him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christie {{was highly}} criticized for first not {{planning}} to return to New Jersey and then staying only briefly for the January 2016 United States blizzard. When asked why he was campaigning in New Hampshire when part of the Jersey Shore was flooded in sea water Christie said: [...] "What {{do you want me}} <b>to</b> do? <b>Go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> with a mop?" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{mounted to}} their perilous seat once more, {{and moved out}} into the night. The wind seemed <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> was a deep hush in the air, as if the high stars listened in their illimitable spaces. The plain seemed as lonely and as {{unlighted}} as the Arctic Ocean. Even the barking of a farm-yard dog had a wolfish and savage suggestiveness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{it will be}} no use waiting here to {{be eaten}} up, Sahib. Do you think Conjeveram would be safe? Because it is easy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> by boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure thing!" [...] {{cried the}} old fire-fighter. [...] "But it's a blaze {{hard to get}} at. If a man tried <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> he'd be smothered in a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I suppose not;--except that {{he advises}} {{me to hold}} my tongue. I think that I shall do that. I mean <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> you know, and I daresay I shall be {{much the same as}} others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{they laid}} him as {{was very good}} to me, very good to me indeed he was. It's time for me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> that <b>there</b> burying-ground, sir, and ask to be put along of him. I wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and be buried. Will you promise to have me took there and laid along with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he {{will not}} be wanting me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{straight}} off <b>down</b> <b>there</b> again," [...] Ralph said ruefully. [...] "I was only back with you one day, mother, after my visit to them, and now I have been five months away it will be very hard if I am to be dragged off again." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{studying}} the images, National Geographic senior editor John Echave said, [...] "They are interesting anomalies, but that's {{as much as}} anyone can say right now, but I'm no expert on sonar and until we are able <b>to</b> actually <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and see, {{it will be difficult to}} characterize them." [...] Professor of oceanography Robert Ballard was quoted as saying, [...] "That's too deep, I'd be surprised if it was human. You have to ask yourself, how did it get there? I've looked at a lot of sonar images in my life, and it can be sort of like looking at an ink blot -- people can sometimes see what they want to see. I'll just wait for a bit more data." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear old Harold Bodkin. I {{know him}} well. In fact, I've a {{standing}} invitation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and {{stay as long}} as I like. Harold is one of my best pals. Harold is a corker. Good old Harold is----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if he won't tell you, I will. They {{have gone}} down to Hampshire, my lass. Bedsworth {{is the name of}} the place, and it is a {{pleasant}} little corner near the sea. I want you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> as well to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad you're up here--where it's {{so clean}} and quiet," [...] said the mother. [...] "I'm told these mining towns are dreadful, almost barbaric, even yet. Of course they're not {{as they were}} in Bret Harte's time, but they are said to be rough and dangerous. I hope you don't have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> often." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{therefore}} {{determined not}} to turn aside to visit any of the camps, but <b>to</b> <b>go</b> straight <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> was no hurrying {{until they reached the}} plains; the horses had to be led every foot of the way. Frequently the road was blocked by long lines of waggons, delayed by a wheel having come off one, or the animals having finally given in. Then there was no moving until scores of hands had chopped down and cleared the trees so as to form a fresh track. In most cases, however, this was unnecessary, as the operation had been so frequently performed that there was a wide belt cleared {{on either side of the}} track.|$|R
50|$|In theory, South {{should have}} {{interpreted}} the final {{double as a}} Lightner double and removed to seven diamonds. However, given that his priorities placed the probable doubled beer ahead of trusting the opponents, he should still not redouble. Since the opponents were non-vulnerable, it just may have occurred to them to remove to seven hearts. While the sacrifice rates <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> two thousand, <b>there</b> is certainly no hope for even North to score the beer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{they laid}} him as wos wery {{good to me}}, wery good to me indeed, he wos. It's time fur me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> that <b>there</b> berryin ground, sir, and ask to be put along with him. I wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and be berried. He used fur to say to me, 'I am as poor as you to-day, Jo,' he ses. I wants {{to tell him that}} I am as poor as him now and have come there to be laid along with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} is nobody there," [...] replied the boy. [...] "Were you told <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to meet anybody? Because, if you were, you had better take some tubs down with you, to sit in. But all I know about it is, that it's the lowest part of this old hole of a castle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{is another}} vault below,' she said, with the severe {{face of a}} young woman who speaks only because it is {{absolutely}} necessary. 'Perhaps you are not aware of it? It was the dungeon: if you wish <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> too, the servant will show you the way. It is not at all ornamental: rough, unhewn arches and clumsy piers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, {{it would}} be as well to observe that precaution,” the Peruvian said. “When we once get a melon patch here we shall not have any reason <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> very often. We have got {{everything}} we want from the wreck, and we have all the coast along to the left to explore, where we may make some useful discoveries.” ...|$|E
2500|$|PA 436 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 119 in Punxsutawney. The {{elevation of the}} highway is at about [...] high. The route goes northward, parallelling US 119 {{for most of its}} length. The highway enters the borough of Sportsburg, where it intersects with Quadrant Route 3010 (Sportsburg Road). Route 3010 heads eastward, ending in a small village. PA 436 continues northward, intersecting with local roads and beginning <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> in elevation. <b>There</b> it enters downtown Punxsutawney and terminates at an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 36 (West Main Street).|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very," [...] said Rollo. [...] "At least, I did {{not think}} so; but uncle George {{told me it was}} a very famous gallery. There were a great many other rooms besides, all carved and gilded most magnificently, and an immense {{staircase}} of marble, wide enough for an army <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up and <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> were several large rooms, too, full of ancient marble statues; but I did not like them very much. They looked very dark and dingy. The paintings were prettier than they.|$|R
5000|$|Christie {{was absent}} from New Jersey 261 days in 2015. Christie was highly criticized for first not {{planning}} to return to New Jersey and then staying only briefly for the January 2016 United States blizzard. When asked why he was campaigning in New Hampshire when parts of the Jersey Shore were flooded in sea water Christie said: [...] "What {{do you want me}} <b>to</b> do, <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> with a mop?" [...] Records show 190 full days and 71 partial days in 2015 cost NJ taxpayers about $614,000. The final quarter of 2015, when Christie spent 32 days out of state campaigning for the presidency, cost $193,890. The bills totaled cost $492,420 in 2014, $220,355 in 2013; $248,277 in 2012; $129,842 in 2011 and $64,975 in 2010, which did not include the cost of overtime for the State Police troopers in EPU, which according to state regulations is confidential. A lawsuit which claimed that Christie [...] "inappropriately forced New Jersey taxpayers {{to cover the cost of}} the governor's security and other key expenses while pursuing the presidency" [...] was dismissed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{drove on}} for a short distance, and soon came to a wagon-track which descended to the little house. 'Anita,' said I, 'I cannot go down that road; it is too rough and rocky, and we should break something. But {{why do you want}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> anyhow? You are not in earnest about living in such a place as that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Riding {{cross-country}} by moonlight on his processional tiger. That's the story. He's {{been seen}} by about two thousand Bhils, skipping along {{the tops of the}} Satpuras, and scaring people to death. They believe it devoutly, and all the Satpura chaps are worshipping away at his shrine- tomb, I mean-like good uns. You really ought <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Must be a queer thing to see your grandfather treated as a god." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wherever {{does one}} have one's tea?" [...] she asked with the oddest thrill of {{excitement}} in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn {{on down the}} grass path, trailing her parasol, turning her head {{this way and that}} way, forgetting her tea, wishing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and then down there, remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers, a Chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird; but he bore her on.|$|E
60|$|Right upon them, {{from some}} place, just out {{the circle of}} light, rose a scream, by reason of its {{proximity}} the most piercing and agonizing yet heard, simply petrifying the group until the peal passed. Anson's huge horse reared, and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap, straight out. He struck Anson with thudding impact, knocking him over the rocks into the depression back of the camp-fire, and plunging after him. Wilson had made a flying leap {{just in time to}} avoid being struck, and he turned <b>to</b> see Anson <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> came a crash, a groan, and then the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up. Apparently he had rolled over his master.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{climb down}} about fifty feet, {{and then you}} get on a sort of ledge, about three feet wide and six or seven feet long. You can't see it from above, because it's a hollow, as if a bit of rock had fallen out. Of course, if you stood up you might be seen by someone below, or on the hill opposite; but it's so high it is not likely anyone would notice you. Anyhow, if you lie <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> no one would see you. I have been <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> often and often, since. When she gets too bad <b>to</b> bear, I <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and take a sleep; or lie there and laugh, when I think how she is hunting about for me to carry down the pails to the stream, for water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They was gettin' the rig'mints away wan by wan, the {{campaign}} bein' inded, but as ushuil they was behavin' as if niver a rig'mint {{had been moved}} before in the mem'ry av man. Now, fwhy is that, Sorr? There's fightin' in an' out nine months av the twelve somewhere in the Army. There has been - for years an' years an' years, an' I wud ha' thought they'd begin to get the hang av providin' for throops. But no! Ivry time it's like a girls' school meetin' a big red bull whin they're goin' to church; an' 'Mother av God,' sez the Commissariat an' the railways an' the Barrick- masters, 'fwhat will we do now?' The ordhers came to us av the Tyrone an' the Ould Rig'mint an' half a dozen more <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> and <b>there</b> the ordhers stopped dumb.
