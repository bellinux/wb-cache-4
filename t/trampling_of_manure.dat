40|$|ABSTRACT. The process <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> {{spreading}} is {{an important}} step in cultivating land for agricultural production. For this rea-son, the technical process <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> spreading was studied using various methods of scientific research and analysis. The focus was primarily on improving the working principles <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> spreading, using so−called wide−angle <b>manure</b> spreaders. Results <b>of</b> the analysis of material transport along the rotor revealed the most relevant parameters <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> spreading. It was found that friction is not the most important parameter. The initial position <b>of</b> pieces <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> and the rotational frequen-cy of the rotor are far more important. The coefficient of friction between the rotor and pieces <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> has a minimum influ-ence on the tangential speed of a piece on the rotor, which in turn also means a minimum influence on the range of spreading. The initial position of the piece on the rotor has an influence on the tangential speed and travel of the piece on the rotor. The tangential speed of the piece as it departs from the rotor is influenced by the size of rotor and the rotational frequency of the rotor. Included are recommendations regarding the process of constructing a new spreading device or improving existing methods <b>of</b> spreading <b>manure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Livestock manure is an {{important}} source of nutrients for crop production in semi-arid West Africa. An assessment of the potential <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> to sustain crop production calls for an estimation of the amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> that could be produced and captured and the feed resources required to maintain livestock used for manuring. This paper presents estimates of the amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> produced by cattle, goats and sheep fed ad libitum under confinement. A model is presented to predict the yearly faecal output by grazing ruminants under fluctuating feed supplies. Statistics on livestock population and cultivated areas are used to evaluate the effects of livestock to cropped area ratios and the spatial location <b>of</b> livestock at <b>manuring</b> time, on the potential amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> available for crop production. The number of cattle, sheep and goats needed to <b>manure</b> different proportions <b>of</b> a 10 -ha farm and the amounts of feed required for herds used for manuring are estimated. Model results indicate that the potential <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> to continuously sustain crop production in semi-arid West Africa is limited by livestock population, spatial location <b>of</b> livestock at <b>manuring</b> time, manure excretion per animal, efficiency <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> collection, and the amounts of feed and land resources available. Since the relative importance of these limiting factors and the possibilities for realising this potential vary both spatialy and temporally, it is suggested that these technical factors should be taken in consideration when evaluating the potential <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> to support crop production at national, regional, or farm level...|$|R

40|$|Manures are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of fertilisers containing these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling <b>of</b> <b>manures.</b> The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution. Under these conditions, 'manure', 'precision farming' and 'environment' should no longer be a contradiction in term...|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the number}} of animals at a {{particular}} site, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) may generate significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure.</b> One method to remove the manure is to apply it to land for fertilization. However, in an effort to dispose <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> at a reduced costs, some CAFOs have applied excess amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> to land areas. The excess amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> may then be washed away by rain into surface waters. This practice was a key feature in the U.S. Court of Appeals case Waterkeeper Alliance, et al. v. EPA, 399 F.3d 486 (2d Cir. 2005). Based on that case, the EPA created its 2008 CAFO Rule. The Rule notes that the CWA specifically exempts agricultural storm water runoff from being considered a point source, but, based on the Court of Appeals' decision in the Waterkeeper case, the EPA may treat land applications of excessive amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> as a point source. So while in general agricultural storm water runoff from CAFOs is a nonpoint source, CAFOs may end up requiring a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit under the CWA.|$|R
