60|$|Nettlewick sat up {{straight}} in his chair. He had listened patiently, but without consuming interest, to <b>the</b> <b>major's</b> <b>story.</b> It had impressed him as irrelevant to the situation, and it could certainly have no effect upon the consequences.

And what he had said amounted to nothing.|$|R

5000|$|Originally every episode {{began with}} a set of {{keywords}} - teaser phrases that summarize <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stories</b> for that episode. The term [...] "keyword" [...] ties into the name of the show as something a search engine uses to categorize things of importance.

50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stories</b> of {{the series}} centers around a red-haired girl named Youko Nakajima from Japan who is {{suddenly}} transported {{to the world of}} the Twelve Kingdoms and searches for her destiny.

The anime uses Youko as a framing device for telling other stories while the novels do not.|$|E
5000|$|Round 1 is the [...] "Film Round". Silent video clips, usually {{from news}} reports, are played to the teams.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Major</b> {{even in his}} {{friendly}} remonstrances, thus {{consulting the}} dignity and honour of Mr Dombey, and showing a lively sense of their importance, Mr Dombey felt more than ever disposed to defer to a gentleman possessing so much good sense and such a well-regulated mind; accordingly he {{made an effort to}} listen to <b>the</b> <b>Major's</b> <b>stories,</b> as they trotted along the turnpike road; and <b>the</b> <b>Major,</b> finding both <b>the</b> pace and the road a great deal better adapted to his conversational powers than the mode of travelling they had just relinquished, came out of his entertainment.|$|R
