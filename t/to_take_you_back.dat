Women are literally confined in small spaces but are constrained even more effectively by social factors such as [...] "miseducation" [...] and [...] "financial dependency". Gilbert and Gubar argue that women [...] "must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling" [...] because [...] "they are too vulnerable in the world at large". For example, in Persuasion Anne Elliot describes the differences between men and women: [...] "We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions." [...] Butler points out that Austen's novels lack depictions of female mentors or authority figures. In the novels, Butler argues, women do not progress from ignorance to knowledge, for example, {{and many of them are}} [...] "oddly and even unnaturally ineffective". Instead, they marry authority figures. As Gilbert and Gubar put it, [...] "becoming a woman means relinquishing achievement and accommodating oneself to men and the spaces they provide". For example, in Persuasion, as Mary and Louisa grow up they lose their independence and become reliant on those around them.|$|E

[...] "I don't {{suppose they}} are much of marksmen, but even a random shot will tell at times, and I want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> all <b>back</b> safe with me; so keep low when {{you get on the}} roof, lads, and don't show your heads more than you can help." ...|$|R

I'm sorry I won't be able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> all <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England, because we are bound for San Francisco, but a trip to California is {{preferable}} to life on a coral island. Now, boy, I've talked enough to you. The steward will bring you some dinner. If you feel disposed, you may get up after that. Here are dry clothes for you.

Last night I was down by the boathouse, and I heard Nat and Frapley talking about you. Nat was very anxious to do something <b>to</b> 'make <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a <b>back</b> seat,' as he termed it, and after a while Frapley consented <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the matter up with him." ...|$|R

You will feed our women and {{children}} till we are quite ready <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them <b>back.</b> <b>You</b> can't put your cowardly noses out of the towns you say you've occupied. You daren't move a convoy twenty miles. You think you've done something? You've done nothing, and you've taken {{a quarter of a}} million of men to do it! There isn't a nigger in South Africa that doesn't obey us if we lift our finger. You pay the stuff four pounds a month and they lie to you. We flog 'em, as I shall flog you." ...|$|R
