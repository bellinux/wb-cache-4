5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended {{mainly from}} Goan Catholics who {{migrated}} to South Canara between 1560 and 1763, {{throughout the course}} of the Goa Inquisition, Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars, and the Portuguese–Maratha wars. They learned <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> South Canara, Tulu, and Kannada, but retained Konkani as their mother tongue and preserved their lifestyle. Their 15-year captivity at Seringapatam imposed by Tipu Sultan, the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, from 24 February 1784 to 4 May 1799 led to the near extinction of the community. After Tipu's defeat and subsequent killing by the British in 1799, the community resettled in South Canara, and later prospered under British rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways {{to say the same}} thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, to aid in the peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks a dwarf, Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr). As the poem starts, Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married. Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that the dwarf must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, Alvíss must tell him {{what he wants to}} know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited. In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E

5|$|Khmer is {{a member}} of the Austroasiatic {{language}} family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India. Austroasiatic, which also includes Mon, Vietnamese and Munda, has been studied since 1856 and was first proposed as a language family in 1907. Despite the amount of research, there is still doubt about the internal relationship of <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> Austroasiatic. Diffloth places Khmer in an eastern branch of the Mon-Khmer languages. In these classification schemes Khmer's closest genetic relatives are the Bahnaric and Pearic languages. More recent classifications doubt the validity of the Mon-Khmer sub-grouping and place the Khmer language as its own branch of Austroasiatic equidistant from the other 12 branches of the family.|$|E
5|$|Learning {{from his}} father, Favre became fluent in <b>the</b> <b>{{languages}}</b> <b>of</b> French, English, Spanish, and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw. The lands along the Gulf coast were {{held by the}} British {{for nearly two decades}} following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, but their ability to maintain control diminished during that time. On September 3, 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles. Favre's father had just died the year before this treaty, and Simon Favre followed his father's career, also inheriting his father's plantation on the Pearl River, though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon {{their ability to}} hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) {{to which they are}} exposed. Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} form of English {{is called}} Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed from {{a set of}} North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. In the fifth century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> Roman Britain (43–409 CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.

5|$|The {{language}} {{family of}} the world that has the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population. This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD), and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20% of the world's population and include many of <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> East Asia, including Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two-valued and multi-valued {{orientation}} in <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> tabloid and quality {{newspapers in the}} U. S. This paper aims at answering the following research questions: Does <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> American tabloids illustrate more two-valued orientation than <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> American quality newspapers? Does <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality newspapers illustrate more multi-valued orientation than <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> American tabloids? In order to investigate the expression of two-valued and multi-valued orientation, categories of the verbal expressions of these two concepts are used. To examine two-valued orientation, the categories include prepositions, words associated with essentialism, correlative conjunctions, pronouns and antonyms. Regarding multi-valued orientation, the categories consist dating, quantifying terms, to-me-ness and words associated with hesitation. The data is selected from two American tabloid newspapers and two American quality newspapers. The focus of the selection of articles is {{the coverage of the}} on-going conflict in Syria in August 2013. According to the obtained results, although <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected quality papers showed less two-valued orientation, the difference seems to be relatively small. This small difference, however, could indicate a slight tendency towards two-valued orientation in <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tabloid newspaper. With regard to multi-valued orientation, the results did not provide conclusive evidence that <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality newspapers illustrates more multi-valued orientation. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tabloid newspapers, however, illustrated noteworthy multi-valued orientation...|$|R
