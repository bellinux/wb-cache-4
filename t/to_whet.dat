This event stands {{as one of the}} most glorious and infamous follies of the 19th century.

2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver {{said that}} [...] "Since 2008, the band has {{undergone}} extensive line-up changes {{that has left}} only singer Kevin Young as the sole original member still standing. Despite these changes, Disciple has continued to release solid hard rock records. Their newest effort, O God Save Us All, is no exception, but is, however, {{a bit of a}} mixed bag. Half of the record feels like the energizing hard rock found of their self-titled album, as well as Scars Remain, while the other half feels more like the same modern rock heard all over the radio. Thankfully, Disciple is able to pull that radio rock sound off better than most." [...] Weaver concluded with saying [...] "Kevin Young's current Disciple doesn't necessarily hit it out of the park, but they do manage to maintain the norm. When the norm is crafting solid rock records with great replay value, 'maintaining the norm' isn't such a bad thing; it's no wonder Disciple has been around so long...Fans of harder rock than typically played on the radio, and fans of radio rock alike, can find common ground on this record. O God Save Us All probably won't end up as the favorite album of most fans, but it still contains plenty of material <b>to</b> <b>whet</b> your hard rock appetite." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is also, however, a {{cultural}} dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative {{groups in the}} Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, The America I Have Seen (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, [...] "They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..." [...] He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: [...] "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it". He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American's preferred music, and which [...] "was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and <b>to</b> <b>whet</b> their sexual desires ..." [...] Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as {{a cultural}} temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially {{with respect to the}} relations between the sexes.|$|E
