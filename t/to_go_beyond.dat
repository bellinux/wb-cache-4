5|$|Dhumavati's outer inauspicious, fearful form {{reveals the}} dangers of {{considering}} sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The winnowing basket, used to separate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to separate the outer illusory form from the inner reality. Her ugly form teaches the devotee <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> the outer deceptive appearances and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E
5|$|In 1582, Day's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete {{another edition of}} Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it on at least four presses. It was unusual for books of this size and ambition <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never went into a third edition.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{was born}} near Udaipur {{and learned to}} play the sarangi at an early age. He studied under sarangi players and singers and, as a teenager, worked as a music teacher and {{travelling}} musician. All India Radio, Lahore, hired Narayan as an accompanist for vocalists in 1944. He moved to Delhi following the partition of India in 1947, but wishing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> accompaniment and frustrated with his supporting role, Narayan moved to Mumbai in 1949 to work in Indian cinema.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{effort to}} establish a penal colony was by Archibald Blair who found the remoteness of the island as ideal for such a colony. But his initiative failed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> 1796 as malaria prevented it.

Scotland failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1994. McCall played just two qualifying games for the 1998 World Cup and his last cap came in a friendly against Denmark on 25 March 1998, as he was overlooked for the final squad for the finals in France along with team-mate Ally McCoist. He was capped a total of 40 times for Scotland, scoring one goal. McCall's caps included 11 while at Everton and 29 during his career with Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Wessex kings {{carried an}} aura of power and success, which made them {{increasingly}} powerful in the 920s, while most Continental houses were in military trouble and engaged in internecine warfare. While the civil wars and the Viking attacks on the Continent had spelled the end of unity of the Carolingian empire, which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms, military success had enabled Æthelstan to triumph at home and to attempt <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> the reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings, {{in order to develop}} a Carolingian ideology of kingship.|$|E

5|$|According to Roberts, it {{is clear}} that the next phase of {{negotiations}} was intended <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made it clear to the Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion that allows him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the limits of the}} probable and journey through the impossible. Eva, realizing what has happened, takes the potion and drinks some as well, so as not to desert Georges. A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to come along and protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with information on how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E

Hence every subalgebra of a Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra.|$|E
