5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> ice wine.

The highest-rated episode was the season premiere, which was watched by 20.93 million viewers.

In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown.

5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} annoyed at {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate {{the success of the}} recent animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
