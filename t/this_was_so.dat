5|$|A {{school day}} at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at the orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> the boys were well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E
5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>so).</b> On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal utilized the double-envelopment tactic. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> successful that the Roman army was effectively destroyed as a fighting force. Following the defeat, Capua {{and several other}} Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{says that}} Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years.

Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and to present himself {{as a model for}} his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be frugal.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E

5|$|The I-5 was {{involved}} in tests of the Zveno project where a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber carried three I-5s as parasite fighters. One I-5 was carried was on each wing and a third over the fuselage. Ramps were used to get the wing-mounted aircraft to their places, but the fuselage-mounted aircraft had to be lifted by hand. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> cumbersome that they were generally used solely as an extra powerplant for the TB-3 later in the program. The aircraft used in these trials used the longer landing gear with smaller tires originally used in the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred is {{believed}} to have come from Middlesex and to have been a member of a wealthy and important family with considerable landholdings in Middlesex and neighbouring regions. Although earlier historians felt that Wulfred came from the Kentish nobility, it no longer appears that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>so.</b> A kinsman, Werhard, owned property near Hayes, and Wulfred later owned property there also. Other evidence suggests that he was related to a noble family that owned lands in Harrow and Twickenham as well as Hayes.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E

5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>so.</b> Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E
