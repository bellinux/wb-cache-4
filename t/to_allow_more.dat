5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} branch line from four to eight trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> services to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 session, Roberts {{sponsored}} several bills {{relating to}} juvenile criminal offenders, including legislation <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> juveniles {{to have their}} criminal records expunged, and to allow young adults to serve sentences within the Youth Offender System instead of correctional facilities. Roberts also sponsored legislation to make minor adjustment to the statutes concerning the Colorado Youth Advisory Council, legislation to create a regional self-insurance plan within the San Luis Valley, and legislation revising statutes surrounding end-of-life care.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossover}} episodes {{were scheduled}} to be shown at an exclusive fan screening hosted by AT on November 22, 2015, but it was cancelled <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for the visual effects to be completed. The first part on The Flash aired on December 1, followed by part two on Arrow on December 2, both on The CW. The crossover was simulcast with the US broadcast in Canada on CTV.|$|E

There are no architectural impediments <b>to</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>more</b> than 2 GB of application code per address space. IBM has started <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Java code running on z/OS to execute above the 2 GB bar, again for performance reasons.|$|R

5|$|The {{journey was}} rich in {{scientific}} results. However, {{the relationship between}} the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament as well as Cook's refusal <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.|$|E
5|$|The probe was {{originally}} scheduled for launch on December 30, 2004, but NASA officials delayed its launch, in order <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for testing the software. It was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on January 12, 2005 at 1:47pm EST (1847 UTC) by a Delta 2 rocket.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the internet, many {{international}} broadcasters have scaled back or terminated their shortwave transmissions in favor of web-based program distribution, while others are moving from traditional analog to digital broadcasting modes in order <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> efficient delivery of shortwave programming. The number of organized shortwave listening clubs has diminished along with printed magazines devoted to the hobby; however, many enthusiasts continue to exchange information and news on the web.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the {{through station}} was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part in the formal design of the prison, {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.|$|E

5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Disney {{announced}} the sequel Finding Dory, confirming that DeGeneres and Brooks would be reprising {{their roles as}} Dory and Marlin, respectively. It {{was scheduled to be}} released on November 25, 2015, but the film's ending was revised after Pixar executives viewed Blackfish. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that the film would be pushed back to a UK July 29, 2016 release. Pixar's The Good Dinosaur was moved to the November 25, 2015 slot <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for production of the film.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the process, and <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, archaeological {{interest}} in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on Camber being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and from young offenders from the Borstal institution in Dover.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Guinan. The task of writing and polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only briefly {{at the beginning of}} the episode <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> screen time for the guest characters. The beat sheet for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
