5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker {{blacks and whites}} of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely {{resemble}} and are difficult to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded.

5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are {{considered}} attractive destinations by those seeking employment as domestic workers. According to Quartz, Hong Kong {{has one of}} the highest densities of foreign domestic workers in the world and its pay scale is a benchmark for other jurisdictions. Since the mid-1970s, when the foreign-domestic-helper policy was initiated, the number of workers has increased to around 300,000. At the end of 2013, there was an average of one foreign domestic worker for every eight households overall; in households with children, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> one for every three. Foreign domestic helpers are about 10 percent of the working population. In December 2014 the number of migrant workers employed as helpers was over 330,000, 4.6 percent of the total population; the vast majority were female.|$|E

5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E

25|$|Pendulous breasts {{can make}} it {{difficult}} for a person to properly fit a bra. For best results, the breasts should be measured twice: once when standing upright, once bending over at the waist with the breasts hanging down. If the difference between these two measurements is more than 10cm, then <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> chosen for calculating the cup size. A number of reports, surveys and studies in different countries have found that between 80% to 85% of women wear incorrectly fitted bras.|$|E
25|$|In another research, {{leading the}} {{international}} ranking, 29.6% of Brazilian men lost their virginity before age 15 (versus 8.8% of women), but <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> really losing virginity at age 16.5 and marrying at age 24 for men, and losing virginity at age 18.5 and marrying at age 20 for women.

25|$|Polyploidy, {{where there}} are more than two sets of {{homologous}} chromosomes in the cells, occurs mainly in plants. It has been of major significance in plant evolution according to Stebbins. The proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by Stebbins to be 30–35%, but in grasses <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> much higher, about 70%. Polyploidy in lower plants (ferns, horsetails and psilotales) is also common, and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants.Polyploidy in animals is much less common, but it has been significant in some groups.Polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{sessions}} {{depends on the}} situation, but <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> 5-20 sessions. A family therapist usually meets {{several members of the}} family at the same time. This has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both for the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian therapist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example psychodynamic and intergenerational, do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both linear and circular causation) and they may use instruments such as the genogram to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.|$|E
25|$|When the oryx is not {{wandering}} its habitat or eating, it digs shallow depressions in {{soft ground}} under shrubs or trees for resting. They {{are able to}} detect rainfall from a distance and follow {{in the direction of}} fresh plant growth. The number of individuals in herd can vary greatly (up to 100 have been reported occasionally), but <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>is</b> 10 or fewer individuals. Bachelor herds do not occur, and single territorial males are rare. Herds establish a straightforward hierarchy that involves all females and males above the age of about seven months. Arabian oryx tend to maintain visual contact with other herd members, subordinate males taking positions between {{the main body of the}} herd and the outlying females. If separated, males will search areas where the herd last visited, settling into a solitary existence until the herd's return. Where water and grazing conditions permit, male oryx establish territories. Bachelor males are solitary. A dominance hierarchy is created within the herd by posturing displays which avoid the danger of serious injury their long, sharp horns could potentially inflict. Males and females use their horns to defend the sparse territorial resources against interlopers.|$|E
