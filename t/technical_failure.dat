5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or flashing lights, to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of a}} lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and <b>technical</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fra Mauro {{formation}} (or Fra Mauro Highlands) is a selenological formation on {{the near}} side of Earth's Moon {{that served as the}} landing site for the American Apollo 14 mission in 1971. It is named after the 80-kilometer-diameter crater Fra Mauro, located within it. The formation, as well as Fra Mauro crater, take their names from a 15th-century Italian monk and mapmaker of the same name. Apollo 13 was originally scheduled to land in the Fra Mauro highlands, but was unable due to an in-flight <b>technical</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF {{would be out of}} position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A second source states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout the entire day), for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a serious German <b>technical</b> <b>failure</b> in air-to-air communication.|$|E

5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few feet off the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a <b>technical</b> <b>failure,</b> its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One <b>technical</b> <b>failure,</b> however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> of the Bravo pH test {{in a population}} with nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: Over {{the course of a}} year, we prospectively studied a population of 66 nonerosive reflux disease patients who received a Bravo pH test. The number and frequency of all <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> were documented, quantified and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, {{with a mean age of}} 41. 7 years, were studied. <b>Technical</b> <b>failures</b> occurred in 15. 15 % of the sample. The most frequent failures were due to poor data reception (4. 5 %), early dislodgement (4. 5 %) and capsule removal (6. 1 %). CONCLUSION: The Bravo capsule pH test involves a low but non-negligible rate of technical problems, a fact that must always be considered by physicians...|$|R

25|$|In addition, {{the limited}} {{availability}} of recovery vehicles and spare parts meant that broken down tanks and other non-combat losses often {{could not be}} repaired. Tanks with even insignificant <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> had to be blown up or burned by their crews upon retreat. The 12th Mechanized Corps, deployed in Baltic Special Military District, had 449 T-26 tanks, 2 flame-throwing tanks and 4 T-26T artillery tractors on 22 June 1941. The corps lost 201 T-26 tanks and all flame-throwing tanks and artillery tractors by 7 July 1941. A further 186 T-26 tanks were lost to <b>technical</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R

25|$|Initially {{the crash}} was {{attributed}} to pilot error and/or <b>technical</b> <b>failure,</b> with no direct evidence for either cause. As the accident happened at night, the pilot might have misjudged his altitude relative to the sea. Allegations raised in the late 1990s resulted in a request to re-open the case {{on the grounds that}} the crew were allegedly under the influence of alcohol, with family of the crew equally desirous of a conclusion to the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Military {{casualties}} on the NATO side were limited. According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities from combat operations. However, on May 5, an American AH-64 Apache crashed and exploded during a night-time mission in Albania. The Yugoslavs claimed they shot it down, but NATO claimed it crashed {{due to a}} technical malfunction. It crashed 40miles from Tirana, killing the two crewmen, Army Chief Warrant Officers David Gibbs and Kevin Reichert. It {{was one of two}} Apache helicopters lost in the war. A further three American soldiers were taken as prisoners of war by Yugoslav special forces while riding on a Humvee on a surveillance mission along the Macedonian border with Kosovo. A study of the campaign reports that Yugoslav air defenses may have fired up to 700 missiles at NATO aircraft, and that the B-1 bomber crews counted at least 20 surface-to-air missiles fired at them during their first 50 missions. Despite this, only two NATO aircraft (one F-16C and one F-117A Nighthawk) were shot down. A further F-117A Nighthawk was damaged as were two A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. One AV-8B Harrier crashed due to <b>technical</b> <b>failure.</b> NATO also lost 25 UAVs, either due to enemy action or mechanical failure.|$|E

25|$|The 1939 Eifelrennen was {{the first}} race of the season for the Auto Union team. Along with fellow {{motorcycle}} racer Hermann Paul Müller, they acted as reserve drivers for the Auto Union team. After qualifying for the 1939 Eifelrennen, Hans Stuck injured his foot playing skittle and the place was taken by Meier, who failed to start the race after a <b>technical</b> <b>failure</b> of his Auto Union Type D. The 1939 Eifelrennen was won by Hermann Lang driving the Mercedes-Benz W154 after Tazio Nuvolari driving for Auto Union tried to run the race non-stop. For the 1939 Belgium Grand Prix, Meier again deputised for Hans Stuck in the Auto Union team. The race, held in heavy rain and poor visibility, was dominated by the Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows of Dick Seaman and Hermann Lang. On lap 14, Meier's Auto Union Type D was forced into a ditch by privateer Adolphe Mandirola driving a Maserati 6CM at Blanchemont on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit and then retired. The 1939 Belgium Grand Prix was again won by Hermann Lang, but was domininated {{by the death of}} Dick Seaman in a crash at La Source hairpin. The 1939 French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux was dominated by Auto Union after the retirement of the Mercedes-Benz drivers, after Rudolf Caracciola crashed on lap 1, a lap-17 engine failure for von Brauchitsch and Hermann Lang on lap 36. The race was won by Hermann Paul Müller for Auto Union and Meier finished in 2nd place after a pit-fire burnt his arm.|$|E
500|$|Serbian sources {{disagree}} with this assessment. General Andrija Biorčević, the former {{commander of the}} Novi Sad corps, has said there were [...] " [...] more than 1,500 killed on our side." [...] The Serbian journalist Miroslav Lazanski, who has close links with the Serbian military, wrote in the Belgrade newspaper Večernje novosti that [...] "on {{the side of the}} JNA, Territorial Defence and volunteer units, exactly 1,103 members were killed." [...] He cited losses of 110 armoured vehicles and two combat aircraft shot down, plus another destroyed due to <b>technical</b> <b>failure.</b> General Života Panić, in an interview with Serbian weekly news magazine Vreme, said that 1,503 members of the JNA were killed in the battle. Colonel Milisav Sekulić stated that 1,180 JNA soldier and TO personnel were killed. According to military historian Norman Cigar, the actual number may have been considerably greater as casualties were consistently underreported during the war.|$|E
