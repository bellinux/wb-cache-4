40|$|Th e park {{provides}} {{the best example of}} the “laurisilva, ” a humid, subtropical, evergreen forest that, during the Tertiary, covered southern Europe and North Africa but then disappeared from these areas during the last ice age. Today laurisilva is a relic forest present mostly in the Macaronesian archipelagos. On La Gomera Island, evergreen forests grow on particular highly evolved soils of volcanic origin, unique in the Canary Islands (Jiménez Mendoza et al., 1990). Th e presence of this evergreen forest on the central plateau of La Gomera contrasts sharply with the arid ecosystems at lower elevations on the island. Traditionally, such ecosystem diff erences have been attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> humid Mediterranean climatic conditions prevailing in <b>the</b> area and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mitigation of drought periods by the incidence of wind-driven fogs (Santana Pérez, 1990).
