5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns <b>to</b> <b>scale,</b> there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns <b>to</b> <b>scale,</b> however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E

40|$|Corrections <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> in the q-state Potts model due to departures of {{the initial}} {{condition}} from scaling morphology are studied at zero temperature in phase-ordering kinetics within Gaussian closure approximation. When the corrections <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> are included, the equal time correlation function has the form G(r,t) =g 0 (r/L) +L -ω g 1 (r/L) + [...] ., where L is the coarsening length scale. Both the correction-to-scaling exponent ω and the correction-to-scaling function g 1 (x) are calculated for different values of q. The correction-to-scaling exponent ω {{is found to be}} nontrivial and depends on q. The corrections <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> are found <b>to</b> be large (relative <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> function g 0 (x) itself) at large scaling variable x.

The specific systems that we consider are the random resistor network and {{a class of}} continuous spin systems, such as the x-y-model. We focus on a family of least irrelevant operators and determine the corrections <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> that originate from this family. Our field theoretic analysis carefully takes into account, that irrelevant operators mix under renormalization. It turns out that long standing results on corrections <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> are respectively incorrect (random resistor networks) or incomplete (continuous spin systems).

5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> the island's cliffs.|$|E

5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E
