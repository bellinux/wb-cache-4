5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E

25|$|When a non-volume {{device is}} being analysed, AutoPlay looks {{in several places}} in the Registry for a DeviceHandlers entry. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a string which, when {{combined}} with other information, selects an EventHandler (which tables the Handlers). The DeviceHandlers entries are commonly placed into the Registry by the manufacturer of the device. There are also broader categories of devices which have preassigned DeviceHandlers, Video Camera devices for example.|$|E

25|$|A {{second type}} of {{singularity}} in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist center lies on a cylinder that is centered about axis 1 and with radius equal to the distance between axes 1 and 4. This is called a shoulder singularity. Some robot manufacturers also mention alignment singularities, where axes 1 and 6 become coincident. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a sub-case of shoulder singularities. When the robot passes close to a shoulder singularity, joint 1 spins very fast.|$|E
25|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, {{the number of}} {{irregular}} satellites orbiting Uranus and Neptune is smaller than that of Jupiter and Saturn. However, {{it is thought that}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a result of observational difficulties due to the greater distance of Uranus and Neptune. The table at right shows the minimum radius (rmin) of satellites that can be detected with current technology, assuming an albedo of 0.04; thus, there are almost certainly small Uranian and Neptunian moons that cannot yet be seen.|$|E
25|$|Certain animals, {{including}} {{bats and}} cetaceans, {{have the ability}} to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of free immunoglobulin light chains in normal individuals is approximately 500mg/day from bone marrow and lymph node cells. There is approximately 40% excess immunoglobulin light-chain production over immunoglobulin heavy-chain synthesis. Possibly <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> to allow proper conformation of the intact immunoglobulin molecules, but an immunological {{role for the}} free light chains has also been proposed. There are approximately twice as many kappa-producing plasma cells as lambda plasma cells. Kappa free-light chains are normally monomeric, while lambda free-light chains tend to be dimeric, joined by disulphide bonds. Polymeric forms of both types of free light chain can also occur.|$|E
25|$|In primates, {{reproductive}} synchrony {{usually takes}} the form of conception and birth seasonality. The regulatory 'clock', in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates—for example, owl monkeys— the periodicity of the moon may also come into play. Synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of 'paternity skew'—defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony—the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously—the harder it is for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others at liberty to mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures a, b).|$|E
25|$|One {{theory to}} explain the {{evolution}} of traits like a peacock's tail is 'runaway selection'. This requires two traits—a trait that exists, like the bright tail, and a prexisting bias in the female to select for that trait. Females prefer the more elaborate tails, and thus those males are able to mate successfully. Exploiting {{the psychology of the}} female, a positive feedback loop is enacted and the tail becomes bigger and brighter. Eventually, the evolution will level off because the survival costs to the male do not allow for the trait to be elaborated any further. Two theories exist to explain runaway selection. The first is the good genes hypothesis. This theory states that an elaborate display is an honest signal of fitness and truly is a better mate. The second is the handicap hypothesis. This explains that the peacock's tail is a handicap, requiring energy to keep and makes it more visible to predators. Thus, the signal is costly to maintain, and remains an honest indicator of the signaler's condition. Another assumption is that the signal is more costly for low quality males to produce than for higher quality males to produce. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> because the higher quality males have more energy reserves available to allocate to costly signaling.|$|E

[...] Of her [...] "Rose's Turn", Gans wrote: [...] "...her rendition of this song may be the highlight of a career already filled with many highlights: She has taken a song that has been delivered incredibly by others and brought it to a new level." [...] Of her performance on the recording of Follies (2011), Steven Suskin wrote in Playbill.com: [...] "This is a fine Sally, the sort of Sally you'd expect to get from an actress like – well, Bernadette Peters.
