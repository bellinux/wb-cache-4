500|$|Tolkien {{begins by}} noting that the {{original}} book has almost been lost under the extensive [...] "'literature'" [...] (his inverted commas) on the subject. He explains that Beowulf had mainly been quarried as [...] "an historical document", and {{that most of the}} praise and censure of the poem was due to beliefs that it was [...] "something that it was not – for example, primitive, pagan, Teutonic, an allegory (political or mythical), or most often, an epic;" [...] or because the scholar would have liked it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> such as [...] "a heathen heroic lay, a history of Sweden, a manual of Germanic antiquities, or a Nordic Summa Theologica." [...] Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall. He builds a tower with some of it, but when people find the stones are older than the tower, they pull it down [...] "to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions".|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{been getting}} {{bored with the}} stereotyped changes that were being used, ... and I kept {{thinking}} there's bound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it.... I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive—Parker.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Rick Astley {{became the}} subject of a viral Internet meme known as rickrolling. In this prank, Web users are tricked into seeing Rick Astley's video [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] when they follow a link that claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Views of this video on various {{websites}} are now in the hundreds of millions. The phenomenon became so popular that on 1 April 2008, YouTube pranked its users by making every single featured video on its front page a rickroll.|$|E

2500|$|Most spyware is {{installed}} without [...] knowledge, or by using deceptive tactics. [...] Spyware {{may try to}} deceive users by bundling itself with desirable software. [...] Other common tactics are using a Trojan horse, spy gadgets that look like normal devices but turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> such as a USB Keylogger. These devices actually {{are connected to the}} device as memory units but are capable of recording each stroke made on the keyboard. Some spyware authors infect a system through security holes in the Web browser or in other software. When the user navigates to a Web page controlled by the spyware author, the page contains code which attacks the browser and forces the download and installation of spyware.|$|E
2500|$|Buscema {{graduated}} from Manhattan's High School of Music and Art. He took night lessons at Pratt Institute {{as well as}} life drawing classes at the Brooklyn Museum. While training as a boxer, he began painting portraits of boxers and sold some cartoons to The Hobo News. Seeking work as a commercial illustrator while doing various odd jobs, Buscema found himself instead entering the comic book field in 1948, landing a staff job under editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee at Timely Comics, the forerunner of Marvel Comics. The Timely [...] "bullpen", as the staff was called, included such fellow staffers as established veterans Syd Shores, Carl Burgos, Mike Sekowsky, George Klein, and Marty Nodell and hired, roughly two months earlier, newcomer Gene Colan. Colan recalled that [...] "...John never seemed very happy in comics... there always seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{he really wanted to}} do." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{said this}} because I knew a doctor from Graz {{who was always}} {{wandering}} about, and because I {{did not want to}} be myself, an Englishman, to these two old ladies. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> So we exchanged confidences.|$|E

5000|$|In other words, a [...] "tulchan" [...] {{can also}} be a living animal, and the usage is of one who gains profit by pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> someone, or <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

60|$|Half a mile {{further on}} she looked {{round in the}} faint hope {{that it might have}} {{recovered}} itself and followed.

60|$|If this reptile is a man, it isn't an IT, is it? That wouldn't be grammatical, would it? I {{think it}} would be HE. I think so.

6000|$|Lastly, {{there is}} in the heart of all men a working principle,--call it ambition, or vanity, or desire of distinction, the inseparable adjunct of our {{individuality}} and personal nature, and flowing from the same source as language--the instinct and necessity in each man of declaring his particular existence, and thus of singling or singularizing himself. In some this principle is far stronger than in others, while in others its comparative dimness may pass for its non-existence. But in thoughts at least, and secret fancies {{there is in}} all men (idiocy of course excepted) a wish to remain the same and yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and something more, or to exhibit what they are, or imagine they might be, somewhere else and to other spectators. Now, though this desire of distinction, when it is disproportionate to the powers and qualities by which the individual is indeed distinguished, or when it is the governing passion, or taken as the rule of conduct, is but a [...] "knavish sprite," [...] yet as an attendant and subaltern spirit, it has its good purposes and beneficial effects: and is not seldom ...|$|E
60|$|Major Stede Bonnet, {{the father}} of Kate, whose mother had died when the child was but a year old, was a middle-aged Englishman of a fair estate, in the island of Barbadoes. He had been {{an officer in the}} army, was well educated and intelligent, and now, in {{vigorous}} middle life, had become a confirmed country gentleman. His herds and his crops were, to him, the principal things on earth, with the exception of his daughter; for, although he had married for the second time, there were a good many things which he valued more than his wife. And it had therefore occasioned a good deal of surprise, and more or less small talk among his neighbours, that Major Bonnet should want to buy a ship. But he had been a soldier in his youth, and soldiers are very apt to change their manner of living, and so, if Major Bonnet had grown tired of his farm and had determined to go into commercial enterprises, it was not, perhaps, a very amazing thing that a military man who had turned planter should now turn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{you were}} a bird you knew the fairies pretty well, and you {{remember}} {{a good deal about}} them in your babyhood, which it is a great pity you can't write down, for gradually you forget, and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy. Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens, they were standing looking at a fairy all the time. The reason they were cheated was that she pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> This is one of their best tricks. They usually pretend to be flowers, because the court sits in the Fairies' Basin, {{and there are so many}} flowers there, and all along the Baby Walk, that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention. They dress exactly like flowers, and change with the seasons, putting on white when lilies are in and blue for blue-bells, and so on. They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all, as they are partial to a bit of colour, but tulips (except white ones, which are the fairy-cradles) they consider garish, and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days, so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch them.|$|E
