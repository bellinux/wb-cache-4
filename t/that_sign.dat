5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{understanding}} {{needed by the}} mind depends on familiarity with the object.

25|$|It is {{not clear}} how many sign {{languages}} there are. A common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide or <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> language is international. Aside from the pidgin International Sign, each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one (although there are also substantial similarities among all sign languages). The 2013 edition of Ethnologue lists 137 sign languages. Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all.|$|E

25|$|UPCI {{doctrine}} also {{distinguishes between}} {{the fruit of}} the Spirit, as mentioned in Galatians 5:22–23, and the initial act of speaking in tongues. The fruit of the Spirit takes time to develop or cultivate and therefore does not qualify as an immediate, outward and identifiable sign of receiving the Holy Ghost. Speaking in other tongues, on the other hand, does serve as <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> and is therefore considered an indispensable part of any person's salvation process. Acts 2:33, they knew they had the Holy Ghost because they could hear them and could see them speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:22, tongues is for a sign, not to them that believe but to them that believe not.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{languages}} are not mime—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary {{and do not}} necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not onomatopoeic. While iconicity is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical. The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed. This does not mean <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> {{languages are}} a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex grammars of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} {{school for the}} deaf (then called the Sumner Deaf and Dumb Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the {{position}} of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> language should be forbidden. (He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was {{the policy of the}} school until 1979.

500|$|Advocacy {{efforts are}} not only limited to science funding, but larger issues of public policy as well. Over the years, the LSA {{membership}} have passed a number of resolutions regarding issues of public policy. In 1987, the LSA officially took a stand against the English-only movement in the United States stating that [...] "English-only measures ... are based on misconceptions {{about the role of}} a common language in establishing political unity, and ... are inconsistent with basic American traditions of linguistic tolerance." [...] Furthering that stance, the membership ratified a statement on linguistic rights in 1996 declaring [...] "the government and people of the United States have a special obligation to enable indigenous peoples to retain their languages and cultures" [...] and declared 7 fundamental linguistic rights including the right [...] "to have their children educated in a manner that affirmatively acknowledges their native language abilities..." [...] which includes the possibility of education in a language other than English. 5 years later, the LSA lent its support for the recognition of sign languages as equal to that of other languages. The resolution, passed in 2001, [...] "affirm <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> languages used by deaf communities are full-fledged languages with all the structural characteristics and range of expression of spoken languages" [...] and urged <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> languages be given the same respect as other languages in academic and political life.|$|E
500|$|Up to the 1950s, the {{predominant}} method in deaf education was oralism – acquiring oral language comprehension and production. Linguists {{did not consider}} sign language to be true [...] "language", but rather something inferior. Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption. Aided by {{the civil rights movement}} of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for manualism, the use of sign language in deaf education. Stokoe noted <b>that</b> <b>sign</b> language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL. In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics. In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as [...] "Ameslan", but this term is now considered obsolete.|$|E
