5|$|Located in {{the town}} centre {{opposite}} the railway station, Calverley Grounds is a historic park with ornamental gardens and a bandstand (now demolished). The park was part of Mount Pleasant House, which was converted into a hotel in 1837, until 1920 when the Borough Council purchased it for the town. <b>The</b> <b>bandstand</b> dated from 1924 and was damaged by an incendiary bomb in 1940 {{and parts of the}} metalwork were sold for scrap metal. The subsequently repaired bandstand and the adjacent pavilion were intended to form part of a new centre to the park but were never completed. <b>The</b> <b>bandstand</b> was demolished in 2010 although the pavilion still exists as a café. Just inside the entrance to the park coming from the station is a memorial to Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, hero of the Battle of Britain, who lived and died in Tunbridge Wells.|$|E
5|$|The 1874 Indian Pavilion was {{severely}} damaged by fire in 1921. It was refurbished, but was then {{destroyed by a}} second fire in 1938.

25|$|In {{the centre}} of the park is a bandstand {{constructed}} in 1890. It is <b>the</b> largest <b>bandstand</b> in London and a Grade II Listed Building. For many years it was also erroneously thought to be one of <b>the</b> <b>bandstands</b> first erected in 1861 in the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens in South Kensington, which would have made it the oldest surviving cast iron bandstand in Europe. However, recent research has shown that these bandstands went to Southwark Park and Peckham Rye, and it appears that <b>the</b> Clapham <b>bandstand</b> was fabricated to a very similar design almost thirty years later.|$|R
5000|$|The Alexander Hamilton Memorial Park {{was opened}} in 1925, gifted by Alexander Hamilton (from Stonehouse) {{who made his}} fortune in carpet manufacture. <b>The</b> {{distinctive}} <b>bandstand</b> [...] came from the 1911 Scottish National Exhibition in Glasgow. <b>The</b> park and <b>bandstand</b> look over <b>the</b> picturesque Avon Valley.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bandstand</b> in Hyde Park was {{originally}} built in Kensington Gardens in 1869, moving {{to its current}} location in 1886. It became a popular place for concerts in the 1890s, featuring up to three every week. Military and brass bands continued to play into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Tree-lined St Peter's Square, to {{the north}} of St Peter's church, has been home to various events {{including}} German Christmas markets. In recent summers a tethered balloon has been placed near <b>the</b> <b>bandstand,</b> offering ascents to sightseers.|$|E
5|$|The seafront and {{the iconic}} cliff at Beachy Head {{has been used}} for many scenes in feature films, and the local council set up a film liaison unit to {{encourage}} and facilitate the shooting of film sequences in and around the town. The 2006 Academy Award-nominated film Notes on a Scandal includes scenes filmed at Beachy Head, Cavendish Hotel and 117Royal Parade. Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters were used as backdrops for scenes from the Quidditch World Cup in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Scenes from Half a Sixpence (1969) were filmed on the pier and near to <b>the</b> <b>bandstand.</b> The seafront area was also used for the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging directed by Gurinder Chadha. The Langham Hotel was a filming location for Made in Dagenham, which also featured the seafront and pier. A sequence of a rainy day at the seaside for the Doel family has as its backdrop the Wish Tower, <b>the</b> <b>bandstand,</b> the Cavendish Hotel and the pier in the 1987 British/American drama film 84 Charing Cross Road directed by David Jones.|$|E

There are a number of drinking venues, especially in the town centre and on the seafront. There are nightclubs, social clubs and many pubs, including one in the recently renovated seafront bandstand. As of January 2013 <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand</b> is an Indian restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Small town friends Edna (Deanna Durbin) and Judy (Judy Garland) are upset. Edna's {{grandfather}} and his orchestra, who play free Sunday concerts {{at a local}} park, have been fired by the town council because the concerts are poorly attended. The girls hit upon the idea of singing at the concerts and set about promoting the next concert. The following Sunday Edna and Judy join Granddad on <b>the</b> <b>bandstand.</b> Edna's operatic style and Judy's swing bring crowds running {{from all over the}} park. The event is a huge success and Granddad's concerts are saved.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, a Royal Navy seaplane base was opened by the coast to defend the Thames Estuary naval towns against attack. It was at first used for both seaplanes and landplanes, but due to landing problems, a separate landplane base was opened in Manston in 1916. After the war, the seaplane base was decommissioned, and the landplane base in Manston eventually became Kent International Airport. During the war, the Coronation Bandstand was converted into sleeping quarters {{for use by the}} Royal West Kent Regiment. In 1925, <b>the</b> <b>bandstand</b> was refurbished and reopened as the 600-seat Westgate Pavilion theatre. By 1931, the town's population had reached 4,554. During World War II, several schools were evacuated to inland areas, with some, such as Streete Court School, leaving the town permanently. On 24 August 1942, a German fighter pilot, Herbert Bischoff, was captured after being shot down and crash landing in a field adjacent to Linksfield Rd, just south of the town.|$|E

25|$|During May Day bank holiday, 2006, the Snowdown Colliery Welfare Band gave a free {{concert at}} <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand.</b> However {{only half of}} the {{building}} had been freshly painted by the Council, which was responsible for decorating the east side. This caused embarrassment to the director of <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand</b> cafe bar, who had not been informed of the repainting plans or the concert. East London Brass gave a concert on 5 July 2009.

25|$|The Central Bandstand, {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand,</b> in Herne Bay, Kent, England, was {{designed}} by H. Kempton Dyson in 1924, extended with an art deco frontage in 1932, and refurbished between 1998 and 1999. It {{is one of the}} coastal landmarks of the town. When first built, it was a popular venue for visiting military band concerts and for tea dances. Edwina Mountbatten spoke there on behalf of the Red Cross in 1939. In the 1920s and 1930s a red carpet would be laid across the road and up to the stage for the conductor of the brass band to walk from the Connaught Hotel which was directly opposite <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand.</b>|$|E
25|$|The bandstand's {{maintenance}} {{had been}} neglected by Lambeth Council for thirty years, and by 2001 {{it was thought}} to be in danger of collapse and had to be shored up with scaffolding for five years. In 2005–2006, a full restoration of <b>the</b> <b>bandstand</b> and surrounding landscape took place, partly funded by an £895,000 lottery grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund matched by £300,000 from Lambeth Council and a further £100,000 from local fundraising efforts and the proceeds of the Ben and Jerry's Summer Sundae event held on the Common. The drainage bund around <b>the</b> <b>bandstand</b> was restored with granite setts during the summer of 2011 at a cost of £12,000 to resolve design faults in the earlier works.|$|E

25|$|Clipperview Ltd {{was granted}} a 20-year lease of the {{building}} in early 1987 and successfully provided entertainment for the summer, then in October the Great Storm of 1987 damaged the roof. Clipperview was obliged to undertake restorations in 1988 {{at a cost of}} £25,000. The kitchen and restaurant were improved, and heating installed in the lavatories. However the restorations were not completed, and in 1990 the Council took legal action. The reinforced concrete had corroded and cracked with sections working loose, cast iron work and steel beams were corroded and the building was vandalised; the Council could undertake only minor remedial work during the legal dispute. Between 1992 and 1998 <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand</b> was empty, in need of repair and closed to the public. In 1995 the Council briefly lost possession of <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand</b> due to a Court dispute concerning Clipperview. The building was formally returned to the town in August of that year and has since remained under control of the Council.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} there was a storm warning cone on top of the bandstand: an upward-pointing cone {{indicated}} a northerly gale; a downward-pointing cone meant a southerly gale was coming in. In June and July 2010, the Beltinge Art Group and the Herne Bay Art Group exhibited watercolours, acrylics and pastels in the building. In 2013 <b>the</b> <b>Bandstand</b> hosted events associated with the centenary of the visit of Marcel Duchamp to Herne Bay in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Wills {{was known}} for his hollering and wisecracking.

When asked if his wisecracking and talking on <b>the</b> <b>bandstand</b> came from his {{medicine}} show experience, he said it did not. Rather, he said that it came directly from playing and living close to Negroes, and that he never did it necessarily as show, but more as a way to express his feelings.|$|E
