5|$|Three {{years after}} the Aurum invasion, Pit is {{revealed}} to be trapped inside a ring with no clear memory of what lead to his predicament. Using hosts {{to make his way}} to a ruined city, he meets up with Magnus, who reveals that Palutena's army has turned against humanity and that Pit's body is attacking humans. Using Magnus' body, Pit defeats his body and repossesses it. Viridi then flies him to Palutena's capital of Skyworld which has been reduced to ruins: Viridi reveals that the Lunar Sanctum was a prison holding <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Kin, a soul-devouring creature that escaped when Pit destroyed the base. <b>The</b> <b>Chaos</b> Kin has possessed Palutena and caused her to become deranged. After obtaining the Lightning Chariot, Pit breaks through the defensive barrier around Skyworld's capital and defeats Palutena. <b>The</b> <b>Chaos</b> Kin then steals her soul, leading to both Pit and Dark Pit pursuing <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Kin into its dimension, <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Vortex, to retrieve Palutena's soul. To save Dark Pit from a final attack from the defeated Chaos Kin, Pit overuses his Power of Flight, burning his wings and nearly dying in the process.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to steal the six Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, the game's antagonist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has trapped the animal {{inhabitants}} of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself. If the player collects all <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown.

50|$|<b>The</b> Elemental <b>Chaos</b> {{corresponds}} to <b>the</b> Inner Planes of earlier editions (excluding the Positive and Negative Energy Planes), also containing {{some aspects of}} Limbo. <b>The</b> Elemental <b>Chaos</b> contains Elemental Realms, which are themselves planes; the Abyss is one such realm.

Creatures native to or connected with <b>the</b> Elemental <b>Chaos</b> (including demons) generally have the elemental origin. The plane is described in The Plane Below: Secrets of <b>the</b> Elemental <b>Chaos,</b> released in 2010.

5|$|Modern Sonic and Tails {{eventually}} {{meet their}} Classic counterparts, and form an alliance to restore their world. The two travel through locations from their past they find in White Space, restoring them to normal. They rescue {{many of their}} friends, including Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, Cream, Blaze and the Chaotix, while battling old enemies for <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds. The two eventually confront Classic and Modern Eggman, who overpower them using the Time Eater. However, the two Sonics use <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat the Time Eater, restoring the timeline to normal. Everyone resumes celebrating Modern Sonic's birthday while Classic Sonic and Tails bid farewell and return to their time. Meanwhile, both Classic and Modern Eggman are left trapped in White Space.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman {{builds a}} robotic {{assistant}} named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who {{was destroyed in}} Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds to perform <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.|$|E
5|$|The game {{progresses}} {{through the}} Westopolis level and five more levels {{from the different}} paths Shadow may take. As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories. He can choose to help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds for himself. The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms to planning to destroy the planet.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for <b>the</b> <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{polynomial}} chaos proxy-based history matching {{and uncertainty}} quantification method is presented {{that can be}} employed for complex geological structures in inverse problems. For complex geological structures, when there are many unknown geological parameters with highly nonlinear correlations, typically more than 106 full reservoir simulation runs might be required to accurately probe the posterior probability space given the production history of reservoir. This is not practical for high-resolution geological models. One solution {{is to use a}} "proxy model" that replicates the simulation model for selected input parameters. The main advantage of <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy compared to other proxy models and response surfaces is that it is generally applicable and converges systematically as the order of the expansion increases. The Cameron and Martin theorem 2. 24 states that the convergence rate of <b>the</b> standard polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansions is exponential for Gaussian random variables. To improve the convergence rate for non-Gaussian random variables, <b>the</b> generalized polynomial <b>chaos</b> is implemented that uses an Askey-scheme to choose the optimal basis for polynomial chaos expansions [199]. Additionally, for the non-Gaussian distributions that can be effectively approximated by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, we use the mixture-modeling based clustering approach where under each cluster <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy converges exponentially fast and the overall posterior distribution can be estimated more efficiently using different polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxies. <b>The</b> main disadvantage of <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy is that for high-dimensional problems, the number of <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> terms increases drastically as the order of <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansions increases. Although different non-intrusive methods have been developed in the literature to address this issue, still a large number of simulation runs is required to compute high-order terms of <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansions. This work resolves this issue by proposing <b>the</b> reduced-terms polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansion which preserves only the relevant terms in <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> representation. We demonstrated that the sparsity pattern in <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansion, when used with the Karhunen-Loéve decomposition method or kernel PCA, can be systematically captured. A probabilistic framework based on <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy is also suggested {{in the context of the}} Bayesian model selection to study the plausibility of different geological interpretations of the sedimentary environments. The proposed surrogate-accelerated Bayesian inverse analysis can be coherently used in practical reservoir optimization workflows and uncertainty assessments...|$|R
