5|$|Optimus {{is given}} the task of {{removing}} the Dark Energon from Cybertron's core by the council. Optimus and his old friend Ironhide, along with rookie Autobot soldier Warpath first attempt to rescue Omega Supreme from the Decepticons, who is being tortured by Dark Energon. They call in Ratchet who heals Omega Supreme. The Autobots free Omega Supreme and gain access to Cybertron's core. Struggling against a mysterious corrupted worm and countless Decepticons, Optimus then speaks with Cybertron's core, which informs him {{that it has been}} heavily damaged by the Dark Energon. It states that it can repair itself by shutting down, but <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>will</b> take millions of years during which Cybertron will become cold, barren, and lifeless. The core then tells Optimus that if he carries a small piece of the core with him, the core can still survive during the repairs. Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>will</b> likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|On 15 February 2017 Toyota {{recalled}} all of {{the roughly}} 2,800 zero-emission Mirai {{cars on the road}} due to problems with the output voltage generated by their fuel cell system. According to Toyota, under unique driving conditions, such as if the accelerator pedal is depressed to the wide open throttle position after driving on a long descent while using cruise control, there was a possibility the output voltage generated by the fuel cell boost converter could exceed the maximum voltage.

500|$|Feynman avoids {{exposing the}} reader to the {{mathematics}} of complex numbers by using a simple but accurate representation of them as arrows {{on a piece of}} paper or screen. (These must not be confused with the arrows of Feynman diagrams which are actually simplified representations in two dimensions of a relationship between points in three dimensions of space and one of time.) The amplitude arrows are fundamental to the description of the world given by quantum theory. No satisfactory reason has been given for why they are needed. But pragmatically we have to accept that they are an essential part of our description of all quantum phenomena. They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the square of the length of the corresponding amplitude arrow. So, for a given process, if two probability amplitudes, v and w, are involved, the probability of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>will</b> be given either by ...|$|E

2500|$|In early August 2005, leaked emails {{from former}} US {{prosecutors}} criticised the legal process, accusing it of being [...] "a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused {{in a process}} that appears to be rigged" [...] and [...] "writing a motion saying that <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>will</b> be full and fair when you don't really believe it is kind of hard, particularly when you want to call yourself an officer and lawyer". Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, [...] "must be seen as historic rather than current."

2500|$|He had {{not been}} Governor General of Canada for five years before Willingdon {{received}} word {{that he was to}} be sent back to India as that country's viceroy and governor general. After being appointed to the British Privy Council on 20 March 1931, he was sworn in as such on 18 April 1931, merely two weeks after he was replaced in Canada by the Earl of Bessborough. When Willingdon arrived again in India, the country was gripped by the Great Depression and was soon leading Britain's departure from the gold standard, seeing thousands of tonnes of gold shipped to the United Kingdom through the port of Bombay. Of this, Willingdon said: [...] "For the first time in history, owing to the economic situation, Indians are disgorging gold.

2500|$|In {{order for}} a cell to be {{transformed}} by a virus, the viral DNA must be entered into the host cell. [...] The simplest consideration is viral transformation of a bacterial cell. [...] This process is called lysogeny. [...] As shown in Figure 2, a bacteriophage lands on a cell and pins itself to the cell. [...] The phage can then penetrate the cell membrane and inject the viral DNA into the host cell. [...] The viral DNA can then either lay dormant until stimulated by a source such as UV light {{or it can be}} immediately taken up by the host's genome. [...] In either case the viral DNA will replicate along with the original host DNA during cell replication causing two cells to now be infected with the virus. [...] <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>will</b> continue to propagate more and more infected cells.
