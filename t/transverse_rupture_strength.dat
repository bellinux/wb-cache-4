40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} fracture and fatigue behaviour of TiC–Ni/Fe cermets under monotonic and cyclic loading. The fracture toughness KIc was determined by a conventional testing method (using single edge notched beam) and evaluated by an indentation technique (indentation fracture toughness (IFT)). Results from both experimental routines were analysed and compared with the reference hardmetal – WC- 10 wt % Co. As the result, a novel sequence for estimation of the IFT for TiC- and WC-based cemented carbides is presented. The <b>transverse</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>strengths</b> RTZ and fatigue strengths σf at a given life (107 cycles) were obtained by the testing of unnotched and notched specimens with the three-point bending scheme. Considering that the fatigue lifetime of cemented carbides is given by the subcritical crack growth of pre-existing defects, a linear elastic fracture mechanics approach is attempted to assess fatigue life–fatigue crack growth relationships for the studied materials. The reliability of used fatigue mechanics approach is proved by the excellent agreement observed between estimated and experimentally determined values for fracture toughness and fatigue strength of the investigated materials...|$|R

Water atomised and sponge irons, Astaloy 1 · 5 Mo, milled ferromanganese, and graphite were the starting powders. During sintering in 75 H 2 / 25 N 2 or pure hydrogen the dewpoint was controlled and monitored; in particular the effects of improving it from - 35 to - 60 °C were investigated. Faster heating rates (20 K min- 1), sufficient gas flowrates, milling the ferro alloy under nitrogen, a low dewpoint (<- 60 °C), and a getter powder can all contribute to the reduction or prevention of oxidation of the manganese, in particular formation of oxide networks in the sintered steels. For 600 MPa compaction pressure densities up to 7 · 1 g cm- 3 were obtained; these were not significantly affected by sintering at temperatures up to 1180 °C. The sintered microstructures were sensitively dependent on the cooling rate. Irrespective {{of the presence of}} Mo, slow furnace cooling at 4 K min- 1 resulted in mainly pearlitic structures with some ferrite and coarse bainite, whereas fast cooling at 40 K min- 1 produced martensite and some retained austenite, very fine pearlite, bainite, and some ferrite.

40|$|Goal of {{the present}} paper is the {{analysis}} of the interparticle neck connections in a system made of insulated iron powder compounds with different additions of an Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy (0. 25, 0. 5 and 0. 75 wt%). The introduction of the aluminium alloy powder has been made in order to improve the mechanical properties, evaluated as the <b>transverse</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>strength,</b> without decreasing the agnetic properties (evaluated in terms of iron loss and coercivity force). The fracture analysis of investigated systems puts into evidence the breaking of interparticle neck connections. Heat treatment (at the temperature of 500 C) contributes to the early stages of interparticle neck developments. The chosen aluminium alloy presents a sort of pre-sintering behaviour at 500 C, with the possibility of mass-transport processes around the insulated iron powder compounds. The air heat treatment applied aims at providing an increase in the mechanical behaviour of the material, with a final good rigidity after the cooling process. Fracture surfaces and <b>transverse</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>strength</b> values show that, at 500 MPa, the strength and the area related to the inter-particle necks can be correlated to the occasional broken insulated point-to-point surfaces that hinder the development of inter-particles necks...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} has {{been concerned with}} the behaviour of solid internal lubricant during mixing, compaction, ejection, dewaxing and sintering of iron powder compacts. Zinc stearate (0. 01 %- 4. 0 %) was added to irregular iron powder by admixing or precipitation from solution. Pressure/density relationships, determined by continuous compaction, and loose packed densities were used to show that small additions of zinc stearate reduced interparticle friction during loose packing and at low compaction pressures. Large additions decreased particle/die-wall friction during compaction and ejection but also caused compaction inhibition. <b>Transverse</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>strengths</b> were determined on compacts containing various stearate based lubricants and {{it was found that}} green strength was reduced by the interposition of a thin lubricant layer within inter~particle contacts. Only materials much finer than the iron powder respectively) were able to form such layers. Investigations were undertaken to determine the effect of the decomposition of these lubricants on the development of mechanical properties in dewaxed or sintered compacts. Physical and chemical influences on tensile strength were observed. Decomposition of lubricants was associated with reductions of strength caused by the physical effects of pressure increases and removal of lubricant from interparticle contacts. There were also chemical effects associated with the influence of gaseous decomposition products and solid residues on sintering mechanisms. Thermogravimetry was used to study the decomposition behaviour of various lubricants as free compounds and within compacts. The influence of process variables such as atmosphere type, flow-rate and compact density were investigated. In a reducing atmosphere the decomposition of these lubricants was characterised by two stages. The first involved the rapid decomposition of the hydrocarbon radical. The second, higher temperature, reactions depended on lubricant type and involved solid residues. The removal of lubricant could also markedly affect dimensional change...|$|R
