The actress also {{gave a speech}} in which she thanked Gorbachev, saying that {{when she and her}} family left the Soviet Union in 1980 they were sadly sure <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see their relatives again and that thanks to him they have been reunited.|$|E
5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years of experience as a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E
5|$|Reveton {{initially}} began spreading {{in various}} European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations {{based on the}} user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of {{organizations such as the}} Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the public about the malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> lock a computer {{in such a way as}} part of an investigation.|$|E
50|$|Cornerstone {{was founded}} by {{director}} Bill Rauch and playwright Alison Carey in 1986. The impulse behind the group, according to Carey, was to create theater for audiences <b>that</b> <b>they</b> otherwise <b>would</b> <b>never</b> come in contact with.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values {{to the extent}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> rob, or kill any living being. Even they would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values {{to the people of}} Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.|$|E
5|$|As the new line-up (with Wright) toured {{throughout}} North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any {{members of}} Pink Floyd from attending his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters also issued a writ for copyright {{fees for the}} band's use of the flying pig, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to The Wall. However, Waters claimed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have the level of success that they had during his tenure again.|$|E
5|$|His signing by the Steelers {{caused a}} social media {{backlash}} by many Steeler fans, with some saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> support the team again. Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab {{at the team}} on Twitter by {{saying that they were}} now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn't proven himself following his release from prison.|$|E

5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers).|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that {{at least for the}} next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. Because part of the Bergen Line had frost heave, trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains to get stuck. NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger baggage compartment. This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish a}} republic in 1919, rather than {{any other form of}} government, was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with Great Britain, and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the Home Rule Act 1914 or continued membership of the British Empire. One obstacle to this decision—that the Unionists of the north-east had long indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved, the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and later the Anglo-Irish Treaty.|$|E

By 1949, there were governmental claims that 12,000 women had been recovered in India and 6,000 in Pakistan. By 1954, there were 20,728 Muslim women recovered from India and 9,032 Hindu and Sikh women recovered from Pakistan. Most of the Hindu and Sikh women refused to go back to India, fearing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be accepted by their family, a fear mirrored by Muslim women.|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Second Vatican Council, biblical theologian Herbert Haag raised the question: Is {{original}} sin in Scripture?
