5|$|After Thiệu's resignation, the South Vietnamese {{military}} situation increasingly declined. On the 26th, the North Vietnamese {{launched an}} all-out attack to take Biên Hòa and the sprawling logistical complex at Long Binh {{from the south}} and southeast. Three days later, <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Vũng Tàu was under assault and the pressure against the Cu Chi front was intense.|$|E

5|$|Numerous smaller strikes {{occurred}} in the Congo later in the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasaï, provoked by the conscription of workers for the mines and deteriorating working conditions. In 1945, riots and strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Matadi.|$|E
5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its {{uninterrupted}} rail link between <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between North Korea and South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into the beleaguered country. Initially, units occupying Japan were called into the country, but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States. In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Pusan.|$|E
5|$|In April 1914 {{the waiting}} for the {{military}} units ended, and American troops {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Frederick Funston were sent into Mexico. The Navy had taken <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Veracruz and the 7th Regiment was ordered {{to take part in the}} occupation of the city. Middleton's landing party went in unopposed and settled into occupation duty without a shot being fired. Middleton spent a total of seven months in Mexico and returned home to Galveston in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775-76. Zahir had turned <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|The British government's {{principal}} {{interest in}} Japan was to renew pre-war trade concessions, and to secure new ones; it was {{particularly interested in}} <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Kobe. The Americans blocked these attempts. Robertson clashed repeatedly with Lieutenant General Sir Charles Gairdner, the official representative of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gairdner was nominally senior in rank to Robertson until March 1947, when Robertson was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, backdated to January 1944. Robertson resisted Gairdner's requests for BCOF aircraft for personal purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Sack of Damietta was a {{successful}} raid on <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Damietta on the Nile Delta by the Byzantine navy on 22–24 May 853. The city, whose garrison was absent at the time, was sacked and plundered, yielding not only many captives but also large quantities of weapons and supplies intended for the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantine attack, which was repeated in the subsequent years, shocked the Abbasid authorities, and urgent measures were taken to refortify the coasts and strengthen the local fleet, beginning {{a revival of the}} Egyptian navy that culminated in the Tulunid and Fatimid periods.|$|E

5|$|U-28s second war patrol {{took place}} from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was {{instructed}} to lay a minefield near <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Swansea. En route to Bristol, U-28 sank two ships; the 5,000ton Dutch tanker MV Sliedrecht and the 5,100ton British freighter SS Royston Grange. U-28 then laid her minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600ton British freighter SS Protesilaus 60 days after it was laid.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} 4th Division {{was still at}} Camp Greene, Middleton wired there {{to find out that}} the unit was already on its way overseas. He caught a train for New York, and when he arrived on 28 April 1918, he found his {{division}} at Camp Mills on Long Island, living in tents and awaiting transport. Middleton was given command of the First Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, and departed New York with his regiment aboard the Princess Matokia on 11 May in a convoy of fourteen ships. Three days out of France, a fleet of destroyers met the convoy and escorted it to <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Brest where they arrived on 23 May. There the division unloaded and organized for several days, subsequently loading onto a troop train to arrive at Calais on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|Early Haifa is {{believed}} to have occupied the area which extends from the present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture. Under Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance. Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s-40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> 'Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop. In the 9th century under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, Arabs and Jews, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city's most lucrative industries.|$|E

5|$|However the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans {{remained}} passive throughout 210 BC, and Philip {{continued to}} make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having beaten back an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian strategos Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba. Moving west Philip probably also took Phalara <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, {{an island in the}} Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, and which he was to use as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cosme caused minor, but widespread, {{damage on}} {{mainland}} Mexico. Unstable structures, {{such as those}} made of wood and coconut, suffered the most damage {{as a result of}} the storm. Flooding and multiple landslides also left damaged and caused road blockages. Heavy rains were reported in southwest and south central Mexico, particularly in Michoacan. High waves were reported along the coast from Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, to Acapulco, Guerrero. In Guerrero, rain caused at least 24landslides, blocking state highways in several locations. Precipitation {{as a result of the}} storm system also resulted in flooding in <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Acapulco. Storm flooding damaged 50homes, mainly due to the overflown streams of the Tlapa River. In Colima, coastal flooding induced by a storm surge damaged 34 tourist facilities, according to the Secretary of State Economic Development. Most of these facilities were located in the municipalities of Tecomny and Armory.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
