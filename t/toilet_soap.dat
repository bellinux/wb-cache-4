25|$|Hard <b>toilet</b> <b>soap</b> with a {{pleasant}} smell {{was produced in}} the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854–925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria, {{to other parts of}} the Muslim world and to Europe.|$|E

There are four distinct departments: 1. The manufacture of soap - toilet, household and soft, 2. Stearine and parafine candles, 3. Refining glycerine, 4. Making all kinds of lubricating oils and machinery grease. [...] The soap department is very nearly in full swing. <b>Toilet</b> <b>soap</b> was started last Saturday. Large quantities of candles are being turned out, which have to be pronounced up to the highest standard, imported or colonial.

The person when has a need, is willing and able to satisfy the need is called a Consumer. A business community that is ignorant of consumer preferences cannot possibly fulfill its obligations in a meaningful and responsive manner. There are Psychological Theories that help us to understand and predict the effect of all external and internal factors on a consumer. External factors include Culture, Society, Reference group and family etc. Internal factors comprise in a consumer mind and how consumers learning, memory, attitude, personality, lifestyle and motivation levels affect consumer behavior. What would initiate a buying process and how a buying decision would end is all covered under the study of consumer behavior. This all further helps relate product / service, price and promotion etc. with consumer behavior. Thus organization can place marketing mix so as to propagate their product/services.

In anger he stalked back to his camp, and there took off the almost ruined suit and buried it in the ground for forty-eight hours, which removed the worst of the odor. Following the advice given, he washed himself in a mud paste, {{allowing}} the mud to dry on him at the heat of the fire. Later he washed the mud off and used some heavily scented <b>toilet</b> <b>soap,</b> and thus removed the worst of the odor from his person.

60|$|With {{an uneasy}} sense of some {{impending}} revelation, Christie descended to the drawing-room. As {{she opened the}} door, a strong flavor of that <b>toilet</b> <b>soap</b> and eau de Cologne with which Whiskey Dick was {{in the habit of}} gracefully effacing the traces of dissipation made known his presence. In spite of a new suit of clothes, whose pristine folds refused to adapt themselves entirely to the contour of his figure, he was somewhat subdued by the unexpected elegance of the drawing-room of Christie's host. But a glance at Christie's sad but gracious face quickly reassured him. Taking from his hat a three-cornered parcel, he unfolded a handsome saffrona rose, which he gravely presented to her. Having thus reestablished his position, he sank elegantly into a tete-a-tete ottoman. Finding the position inconvenient to face Christie, who had seated herself on a chair, he transferred himself {{to the other side of}} the ottoman, and addressed her over its back as from a pulpit.|$|E
6000|$|I {{might have}} waited long. Perhaps I lack a sense; for our whole {{existence}} {{seemed to me}} one dreary bustle, and the place we bustled in fitly {{to be called the}} Place of Yawning. I slept in a little den behind the office; Pinkerton, in the office itself, stretched on a patent sofa which sometimes collapsed, his slumbers still further menaced by an imminent clock with an alarm. Roused by this diabolical contrivance, we rose early, went forth early to breakfast, and returned by nine to what Pinkerton called work, and I distraction. Masses of letters must be opened, read, and answered; some by me at a subsidiary desk which had been introduced on the morning of my arrival; others by my bright-eyed friend, pacing the room like a caged lion as he dictated to the tinkling type-writers. Masses of wet proof had to be overhauled and scrawled upon with a blue pencil--"rustic"; [...] "six-inch caps"; [...] "bold spacing here"; or sometimes terms more fervid--as, for instance, this (which I remember Pinkerton to have spirted on the margin of an advertisement of Soothing Syrup), [...] "Throw this all down. Have you never printed an advertisement? I'll be round in half-an-hour." [...] The ledger and sale-book, besides, we had always with us. Such was the backbone of our occupation, and tolerable enough; but the far greater proportion of our time was consumed by visitors--whole-souled, grand fellows no doubt, and as sharp as a needle, but to me unfortunately not diverting. Some were apparently half-witted, and must be talked over by the hour before they could reach the humblest decision, which they only left the office to return again (ten minutes later) and rescind. Others came with a vast show of hurry and despatch, but I observed it to be principally show. The agricultural model, for instance, which was practicable, proved a kind of fly-paper for these busybodies. I have seen them blankly turn the crank of it for five minutes at a time, simulating (to nobody's deception) business interest: [...] "Good thing this, Pinkerton? Sell much of it? Ha! Couldn't use it, I suppose, as a medium of advertisement for my article?"--which was perhaps <b>toilet</b> <b>soap.</b> Others (a still worse variety) carried us to neighbouring saloons to dice for cocktails and (after the cocktails were paid) for dollars on a corner of the counter. The attraction of dice for all these people was, indeed, extraordinary: at a certain club where I once dined in the character of [...] "my partner, Mr. Dodd," [...] the dice-box came on the table with the wine, an artless substitute for after-dinner wit.|$|E

[...] After initial difficulties in managing the sugar mill, Gujarmal successfully managed to turn things around to make his debut venture into a profitable entity. One of Gujarmal’s major successes was the <b>toilet</b> <b>soap</b> factory, which began operations in 1941. Gujarmal {{with the help of a}} Bengali gentleman figured out a way to produce <b>toilet</b> <b>soap</b> without the use of tallow— the substance used to make the soap cake dry and hard. Instead, his <b>toilet</b> <b>soap</b> factory used vanaspati, from his vanaspati manufacturing unit, which proved to be a huge success.|$|E
