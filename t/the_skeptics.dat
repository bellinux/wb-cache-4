25|$|Yet another {{prominent}} spiritualist and trance medium {{prior to}} the Civil War was Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875), of mixed race, who also {{played a part in}} the abolitionist movement. Nevertheless, many abolitionists and reformers held themselves aloof from the spiritualist movement; among <b>the</b> <b>skeptics</b> was the famous abolitionist, Frederick Douglass.|$|E

40|$|Several {{critics of}} contextualism {{claim that this}} view cannot {{consistently}} maintain its advertised neutrality between skepticism and anti-skepticism. Some critics contend that contextualists are forced to side with <b>the</b> <b>skeptic,</b> since any defense of contextualism unavoidably puts in place <b>the</b> <b>skeptic's</b> high requirements for knowledge; others hold that the contextualists' claim to have knowledge of what their own view entails forces them to reject <b>the</b> <b>skeptic's</b> knowledge denial. I show that these arguments misconstrue the role of context in contextualism, and explain how we are to understand the contextualist's proposed agreement with both <b>the</b> <b>skeptic's</b> knowledge denial and the anti-skeptic's knowledge attribution...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{unclear if}} RAT is {{sufficient}} to defeat skepticism. Although RAT is capable of defending against one of <b>the</b> <b>skeptic's</b> attack on knowledge, <b>the</b> <b>skeptic</b> may have other tools that RAT cannot defeat.|$|R
25|$|The {{existence}} of Unruh radiation is not universally accepted. Some {{claim that it}} has already been observed, while others claim that it is not emitted at all. While <b>the</b> <b>skeptics</b> accept that an accelerating object thermalizes at the Unruh temperature, they do not believe that this leads to the emission of photons, arguing that the emission and absorption rates of the accelerating particle are balanced.|$|E
25|$|While most cryptozoologists {{recognize}} {{that at least}} some reports are simple misidentifications, they claim that many of the creatures described by those who have seen them look nothing like the known species put forward by skeptics and claim that certain reports stick out. For their part, <b>the</b> <b>skeptics</b> remain unconvinced, pointing out that {{even in the absence of}} outright hoaxes, imagination has a way of twisting and inflating the slightly out-of-the-ordinary until it becomes extraordinary.|$|E
25|$|In late 1990, due to {{a sudden}} onset of leukemia, Seckel had to enter the hospital, where his health quickly deteriorated. The Southern California Skeptics folded. In 1991, Michael Shermer started a new Los Angeles-area skeptical group called <b>The</b> <b>Skeptics</b> Society, using SCS's mailing list and {{involving}} many of its original board members. Seckel started to recover from his illness in 1994, turning his full attention to studying the human brain, specifically vision and how it relates to perception.|$|E

25|$|Research in anomalistic {{psychology}} {{has discovered}} {{that in some cases}} telepathy can be explained by a covariation bias. In an experiment (Schienle et al. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst <b>the</b> <b>skeptics</b> made accurate hit judgments. The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by hindsight and confirmation biases.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin {{has long}} had an {{interest}} in magic. While in college he honed his skills as a magician and attended magic conferences. At one of these conferences he met well-known magician and skeptic James Randi, who greatly influenced Benjamin's decision to perform Mathemagics shows for live audiences. Randi invited him to perform his mathematical tricks on a television program called Exploring Psychic Powers Live, co-hosted by Uri Geller. Randi also encouraged Benjamin to become involved in the growing skeptical movement. He attended early meetings of the Southern California Skeptics in the 1990s, which later evolved into <b>the</b> <b>Skeptics</b> Society. It was at these meetings that he met Skeptics Society President Michael Shermer, who would later become a co-author on three of Benjamin's books.|$|E
25|$|Most {{adherents of}} the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account. Within the Latter Day Saint movement {{there are several}} apologetic groups that disagree with <b>the</b> <b>skeptics</b> and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), and Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the limited geography model, which states {{that the people of}} the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either Mesoamerica, South America, or the Great Lakes area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

25|$|For the 1996 season, Oklahoma hired former player John Blake as head coach. Blake was the {{favorite}} to succeed Schnellenberger and {{was backed by}} Barry Switzer, Steve Owens, and former Oklahoma president George Lynn Cross. However, many were skeptical of Oklahoma's choice for the new coach. His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to his predecessor. In his seven-year coaching career (four years at OU, three years with the Dallas Cowboys and one year at Tulsa), {{he had never been}} more than a position coach. <b>The</b> <b>skeptics</b> were proven right. In Blake's first season, he went 3–8. It was the worst record, percentage wise, Oklahoma had experienced since 1895 and is tied for the most losses in one year (along with Blake's 1997 squad) to this very day. In his three years at Oklahoma, Blake went 3–8, 4–8, and 5–6 for a final record of 12–22. It was the first time since 1922–1924 that Oklahoma had three consecutive losing seasons. Blake's largest contribution to the team was his recruiting. He set the stage by recruiting several players that would help lead the program's resurgence, including J.T. Thatcher, Josh Norman, Roy Williams and Rocky Calmus. Many of them got a chance to play fairly quickly, since Blake's teams were often out of games early. Blake was fired after the 1998 season.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced <b>the</b> <b>skeptics</b> who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
50|$|Epistemic closure, however, is {{vulnerable}} to exploitation by <b>the</b> <b>skeptic.</b> Eating oatmeal entails not eating scrambled eggs. It also entails not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon into believing one is eating oatmeal. Because John does not have {{evidence to suggest that}} he is not being deceived by an evil demon, <b>the</b> <b>skeptic</b> argues that John does not know he is eating oatmeal. To combat this attack by <b>the</b> <b>skeptic,</b> Dretske develops relevant alternatives theory (RAT).|$|R

500|$|In the 1870s, {{a scandal}} was exposed, in which {{contractors}} for star postal routes were greatly overpaid {{for their services}} with the connivance of government officials (including Second Assistant Postal Secretary Thomas J. Brady and former Senator Stephen Wallace Dorsey). Reformers feared Arthur, as a former supporter of the spoils system, would not commit to continuing {{the investigation into the}} scandal. But Arthur's Attorney General, Brewster, did in fact continue the investigations begun by MacVeigh, and hired notable Democratic lawyers William W. Ker and Richard T. Merrick to strengthen the prosecution team and forestall <b>the</b> <b>skeptics.</b> [...] Although Arthur had worked closely with Dorsey before his presidency, once in office he supported the investigation and forced the resignation of officials suspected in the scandal. An 1882 trial of the ringleaders resulted in convictions for two minor conspirators and a hung jury for the rest. [...] After a juror came forward with allegations that the defendants attempted to bribe him, the judge set aside the guilty verdicts and granted a new trial. [...] Before the second trial began, Arthur removed five federal office holders who were sympathetic with the defense, including a former Senator. [...] The second trial began in December 1882 and lasted until July 1883 and, again, did not result in a guilty verdict. [...] Failure to obtain a conviction tarnished the administration's image, but Arthur did succeed in putting a stop to the fraud.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{biography}} for <b>The</b> <b>Skeptics</b> Society, Schell cites an essay by Junior Skeptic Magazine Editor Daniel Loxton, [...] "Where {{do we go}} from here?", as a source of inspiration for her skeptical outreach. “It brought home just how much work there really is to do, but it also helped me understand that we can move beyond simply being skeptics ourselves. With enough effort and the right planning, we really can help people become better critical thinkers." [...] "There is more to skepticism than just being right."

Derrida utilized, like Heidegger, references to Greek philosophical notions associated with <b>the</b> <b>Skeptics</b> and the Presocratics, such as Epoché and Aporia to articulate his notion of implicit circularity between premises and conclusions, origins and manifestations, but—in a manner analogous in certain respects to Gilles Deleuze—presented a radical re-reading of canonical philosophical figures such as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes as themselves being informed by such [...] "destabilizing" [...] notions.|$|E
