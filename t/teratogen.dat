Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a <b>teratogen.</b> Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute {{high dose}} {{exposure}} to teratogenic chemicals alters the proper {{development of an}} embryo leading to infertility, impaired fecundity, and few viable offspring. However, chronic exposure to sub-toxic doses of <b>teratogens</b> during early development may also have long-term impacts on egg quality and embryo viability. Methods: To test the hypothesis that low dose exposure during early development can impact long-term reproductive health, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae were exposed to 10 <b>teratogens</b> during larval development, and subsequently were examined for the pattern of egg-laying and egg quality (hatched larvae and embryo viability) as gravid adults.  After the exposure, adult gravid worms were transferred to untreated plates and the numbers of eggs laid were recorded every 3 hours, and the day following exposure the numbers of hatched larvae were counted. Results: While fecundity and fertility were typically impaired by <b>teratogens,</b> unexpectedly, many <b>teratogens</b> initially increased egg-laying at the earliest interval compared to control but not at later intervals. However, egg quality, as assessed by embryo viability, remained the same {{because many of the}} eggs (< 50 %) did not hatch. Conclusions: Chronic, low dose exposures to <b>teratogens</b> during early larval development have subtle, long-term effects on egg laying and egg quality...|$|R

40|$|Teratology, {{study of}} {{abnormal}} prenatal development, as a descriptive science has starts with written language. The modern experimental teratology era {{started in the}} early quarter of 20 th centaury. Since the thalidomide catastrophe in early 1960 s regulatory agencies launched requirements for new drugs to be thoroughly tested on animals prior to human use. One of the major concerns in the teratological studies is the mechanism of teratogenesis; {{it is very difficult}} to know the exact mechanism of teratogenesis. However there are many proposed mechanism of teratogenesis by Wilson 1973. <b>Teratogens</b> induce one or multiple unique pathogenic responses in the developing embryos. Susceptibility f teratogenesis varies with age and therefore can be divided into three developmental periods: early embryonic development, organogenesis and early differentiation, and late embryonic development. Animal based studies provide the initial guideline if a chemical or drug may present a teratogenic risk. A variety of laboratory animals from different classes of animals are being used for the teratological studies. Rat, rabbit, mice, hamster, and non human primates are the most prevalent laboratory animal species of the mammal class. Xenopus laevis of the amphibian class has been used and suggested as a model for mammalian teratogenicity. From the bird class chicken, duck and quail have been used most often in laboratory studies. Zebrafish, Japanese medaka and fathead minnow are the most commonly used laboratory fish species, promoted by OECD for future testing of chemical toxicity. <b>Teratogens</b> can be classified as recreational and social <b>teratogens,</b> pharmaceutical <b>teratogens,</b> industrial and environmental <b>teratogens,</b> agricultural <b>teratogens,</b> and metabolic and infectious diseases.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent. These exposures include, {{but are not limited}} to, medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and occupational exposures. Paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential <b>teratogen.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background & Objectives: Teratology is {{a branch}} of {{embryology}} science that studies causes, mechanisms and abnormal pattern development. Embryo growth traumatic factors during pregnancy are called <b>teratogens</b> that some <b>teratogens</b> pass the placental barrier and cause adverse effect during development stages and malformation, however a drug may improve general health of the mother, {{but it might be}} poisonous for embryo and cause diverse malformation. Since study of embryo health and risk factor in this stage is important, the aim of this review article was the investigation of some types of teratosgens (such as radiation, infectious agents, heat disorders, maternal conditions) and particularly the effect of teratogenic drugs on embryo including some legal drugs (such as acetaminophen, thalidomide, acyclovir, sedatives and anticonvulsants) and illegal drugs (such as nicotine, alcohol, cocaine and marijuana). Conclusion: In general, <b>teratogens</b> depending on the type and duration of exposure in pregnancyperiod, adversely affect embryo and cause various disorders. A better understanding of these <b>teratogens</b> can contribute to prevent these defects, since many other drugs with similar effects and lower teratogenicity can be used to improve mothers’ health...|$|R

25|$|For the {{treatment}} of acne, the most prescribed retinoid drug is 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin). It reduces the size and secretion of the sebaceous glands. Although {{it is known that}} 40mg of isotretinoin will break down to an equivalent of 10mg of ATRA— the mechanism of action of the drug (original brand name Accutane) remains unknown and is a matter of some controversy. Isotretinoin reduces bacterial numbers in both the ducts and skin surface. This is thought to be a result of the reduction in sebum, a nutrient source for the bacteria. Isotretinoin reduces inflammation via inhibition of chemotactic responses of monocytes and neutrophils. Isotretinoin also has been shown to initiate remodeling of the sebaceous glands; triggering changes in gene expression that selectively induce apoptosis. Isotretinoin is a <b>teratogen</b> with a number of potential side-effects. Consequently, its use requires medical supervision.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, or retinol, is {{the sole}} vitamin which is {{embryotoxic}} even in a therapeutic dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, the retinoic acid, {{plays an important role}} as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs. Its natural precursor, the β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophile vitamins, including retinol. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamine A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong <b>teratogen</b> that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women, and that the patient is aware of {{how important it is to}} prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. Medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamine A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (microphthalmia), ears, thymus, face deformities, neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as mental retardation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its carcinogenic properties, DES is a known <b>teratogen,</b> an agent capable of causing malformations in daughters and sons who were exposed in utero.

These anomalies contribute to an increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in prenatally DES-exposed daughters. The most recent published research on DES daughters' adverse health outcomes documented by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) appears in the October 6, 2011 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine under the authorship of RN Hoover et al., and lists these adverse effects and risk factors: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5%; spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6%; preterm delivery, 53.3% vs. 17.8%; loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7%; ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9%; preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7%; stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6%; early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7%; grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4%; and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2%.
