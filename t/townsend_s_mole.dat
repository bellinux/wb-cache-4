40|$|The {{quantum yield}} of {{photosynthetic}} O 2 exchange {{was measured in}} eight species of leaf succulents representative of both malic enzyme type and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase type CAM plants. Measurements were made at 25 °C and CO 2 saturation using a leaf disc O 2 electrode system, either during or after deacidification. The mean quantum yield was 0. 095 ± 0. 012 (<b>sd)</b> <b>moles</b> O 2 per mole quanta, which compared with 0. 094 ± 0. 006 (<b>sd)</b> <b>moles</b> O 2 per mole quanta for spinach leaf discs measured under the same conditions. There were no consistent differences in quantum yield between decarboxylation types or during different phases of CAM metabolism. On the basis of current notions of compartmentation of CAM biochemistry, our observations are interpreted to indicate that CO 2 refixation is energetically independent of gluconeogenesis during deacidification...|$|R

40|$|Problems {{experienced}} {{with the land}} fill disposal of highly corrosive acid tar wastes mean that alternative, less environmentally damaging methods of disposal must be employed. The incineration of acid tars, although possessing several advantages over landfill disposal, can lead to unacceptably high SO 2 -emission concentrations in the flue gases unless precautions are taken. However, such incinerations have been achieved successfully in the present tests with a two-stage fluidised-bed combustor: the attained combustion efficiencies were high (at around 99 %). The use of a fluidised-bed combustor for burning acid tar requires that limestone {{be added to the}} bed material in order to provide some degree of sulphur capture. The sensitivity of the SO 2 emission to the limestone concentration (as indicated by the Ca: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio) fell as the Ca: S ratio was increased. At a Ca: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio of 4 : 1, 91 % sulphur retention was achieved. During this test, 340 kg/h acid tar was pumped into the bed and burnt there successfully with 98 kg/h coal: the bed's temperature and height, and the excess oxygen-in-flue concentration were kept constant. Ultimately, average SO 2 emission-levels (in the flue gas) of around 417 ppm were thereby achieved; i. e., well below the 600 ppm SO 2 -emission limit stipulated by the Commission of the European Communities. Nevertheless, the fluctuations in the SO 2 emissions meant that a slightly higher Ca: S ratio of 5 : 1 was recommended {{in order to ensure that}} the emission levels were consistently below the required limit, i. e., such that 97 % of all the mean 48 -hourly values would not exceed 110 % of the stipulated emission limit. ...|$|R

40|$|Physicochemical processes, {{such as the}} Lo-cat and Amine-Claus process, are {{commonly}} used to remove hydrogen sulfide from hydrocarbon gas streams such as landfill gas, natural gas, and synthesis gas. Biodesulfurization offers environmental advantages, but still requires optimization and more insight in the reaction pathways and kinetics.

40|$|Aims:  To {{compare the}} {{susceptibility}} of a 3 -day-old biofilm and planktonic Salmonella to disinfectants at different exposure times. We hypothesize that Salmonella biofilms are more resilient to disinfectants compared to planktonic Salmonella. Methods and Results:  The susceptibility of planktonic cells to disinfectants was tested by {{a modified version}} of the Council of Europe suspension test EN 1276. Salmonella biofilms were formed using the Calgary Biofilm Device. Results show that 3 -day-old Salmonella biofilms are less susceptible to the disinfectants benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine gluconate, citric acid, quaternary ammonium compounds, sodium hypochlorite (SH) and ethanol, compared to planktonic Salmonella. Surprisingly, the results also demonstrate that low concentrations of SH were more effective against a 3 -day-old biofilm compared to high concentrations of SH. Conclusions:  While all the disinfectants evaluated were able to reduce biofilm-associated cells at concentrations and contact times sufficient to eliminate planktonic cells, there were still sufficient viable cells remaining in the biofilm to cause further contamination and potential infection. Significance and Impact of the Study:  Protocols for the use of chemical disinfectants need to include biofilm susceptibility testing. There is a requirement for an effective and standardized tool for determining the susceptibility of biofilms to disinfectants. H. S. Wong, K. M. <b>Townsend,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Fenwick, R. D.

40|$|Two phase {{pure copper}} sulfides, rhombohedral phase digenite (Cu 9 S 5) and {{hexagonal}} phase covellite (CuS) {{have been successfully}} prepared via hydrothermal method using copper nitrate and sodium thiosulfate without any assisting agent. The structural, chemical, and thermal properties of the as-synthesized phase pure systems were investigated with various characterization techniques, including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), BET gas sorption, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), energy dispersive X-ray scpectroscopy (EDX), thermogravimetric analysis coupled to mass scpectroscopy (TGA-MS), as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. In this study, the phase pure covellite has shown a potential ability to remove Hg(II) in aqueous system with maximum sorption capacity of ca. 400 mg/ g {{can be reached at}} pH 4. The collected experimental data is best fitted to Langmuir isotherm and the sorption of Hg(II) onto covellite in aqueous system is favored {{in a wide range of}} pH. This was supported by the calculated thermodynamic parameter, ΔG° which has shown that the sorption of Hg(II) onto covellite is favorable in a wide range of pH, particularly at low pH. Apart from that, three synthesis parameters (synthesis temperature, Cu: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio, and synthesis time) have been systematically investigated throughout the study. It was found that synthesis temperature and Cu: <b>S</b> <b>mole</b> ratio determined the phase purity, crystal phase, and morphology of the final products formed; while synthesis time has pronounced effect on the crystallite size of the yields. Furthermore, several mechanistic pathways leading to the final formation of covellite were proposed and discussed based on the detailed analysis of PXRD done at different synthesis temperatures. This current study also revealed that the renowned most stable phase in copper sulfide family, covellite has transformed into a mixed phase of pentahydrate copper sulfate and covellite at ambient condition after a certain period. It could be shown that covellite is an air-sensitive material which undergoes structural changes after exposure to moisture or air. This discovery was supported with various observations from PXRD, EDX, and TG-MS techniques. Therefore, phase stability study was conducted to find out the most efficient way to store copper sulfides besides to investigate the stability of covellite over a series of time at ambient condition. The phase stability experiments indicated that covellite with the common washing and storage methods described in the research methodology was stable up to 4 weeks. Covellite with the purging of nitrogen gas before storage is the best method to prevent covellite from further oxidation...|$|R

40|$|Accepted {{manuscript}} online: 15 DEC 2015 Information on fracture biomechanics {{has implications}} in materials research and clinical practice. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the influence of non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL) size, restorative status and direction of occlusal loading on the biomechanical behavior of mandibular premolars, using finite element analysis (FEA), strain gauge tests and fracture resistance tests. Ten buccal cusps were loaded on the outer and inner slopes to calculate the strain generated cervically. Data were collected for healthy teeth at baseline and progressively at three lesion depths (0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 5 mm), followed by restoration with resin composite. The magnitude and distribution of von Mises stress and maximum principal stress were simulated at all stages using FEA, and fracture strength was also determined (n = 7 per group). There were significant effects of the lesion size and loading directions on stress, strain and fracture resistance (p< 0. 05). Fracture resistance values decreased with increase in lesion size, but returned to baseline with restorations. Combined assessment of computer-based and experimental techniques provide an holistic approach to characterize the biomechanical behaviour of teeth with both unrestored and restored NCCLs.
