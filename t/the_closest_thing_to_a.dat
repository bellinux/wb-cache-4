This period is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> golden age in Egyptian tradition, {{the period of}} {{stability}} that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of maat.|$|E

25|$|During these investigations, {{numerous}} witnesses {{came forward}} with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre.

25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. <b>The</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred {{to the amount of}} land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E

Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions {{thanks in part to the}} limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E
25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monograph are chapters {{dedicated to}} his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they {{paint a picture of}} a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E

[...] He noted that Black Lives Matter is not monolithic and [...] "is a movement comprising numerous groups. ...

500|$|Regarding the {{commercial}} {{impact of the}} album, Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watson wrote, [...] "For a pop star who was once dismissed as being incapable of yielding more than one hit song per album, Rihanna's newfound staying power {{is nothing short of}} remarkable–and proof that there's room for more than one diva in this game." [...] Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic concluded that it was Good Girl Gone Bad that made Rihanna a [...] "full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the album, as <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce.|$|E
500|$|Simkins {{noted that}} Tillman [...] "rose above the {{handicap}} of his radical views, his obstreperousness, and the insularity of his issues {{to become a}} considerable force in national politics".

[...] "To students of black history and racial equality its most striking features are {{the extent to which it}} expressed the desire of white Carolinians to dominate blacks and the fact that much of its unity and force derived from its antiblack racial policies." [...] Tillman's movement took power from the Bourbon Democrats in South Carolina, but a greater price was paid, electorally and in lives, by African Americans.|$|E

500|$|J. Edward Keyes of eMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars and wrote that the [...] "uber-futurist" [...] {{production}} of the release accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "Robo Dominatrix vocal approach—is a big reason the record works so well. Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded is all blue-light electronics and primal throb, 25th-century pop music in the here and now." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine also gave Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded {{four out of five}} stars, but was skeptical about the choice to re-release the album, writing that [...] "it isn't worth forking out for Good Girl Gone Bad twice just to hear the new songs". Despite that, he praised the newly added songs especially [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again"; he called the song [...] "superior". Levine further wrote, [...] "if Reloaded encourages a few hesitant pop fans to invest in this album, <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Thriller that 2007/8 is likely to produce, this rather cynical reissue should be let off the hook... just." [...] Among other achieved awards and nominations, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] received nominations for Best Dance Recording and Pop Collaboration with Vocals respectively at the 2009 Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe he would be <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel {{went on to become a}} much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in the science fiction sequel [...] Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, [...] "I was paid to show off basically". The Wall Street Journal found little fun in the movie [...] "except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen" [...] while The New York Times said he [...] "shows up to deliver <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> performance in the movie". The Daily Telegraph felt his [...] "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is". However, USA Today felt his [...] "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable. On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, The Special Relationship, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the [...] "special relationship" [...] between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; both parties have since said they will not work together again [...] "for the foreseeable future". Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC's 30 Rock as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom's star and creator, has said that [...] "he was so funny and delightful to work with". In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Since his {{appearance}} in Final Fantasy XII, Balthier has received mostly positive reception. When {{he was first}} revealed, the fan response was very positive. GameSpy's Justin Speer described him as a [...] "clever-bastard type", praising his wry delivery. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called Balthier the best character in the game, describing him as the [...] "Auron of the cast". 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish called Final Fantasy XII protagonist Vaan annoying, placing the duo of Balthier and Fran above him. 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister stated Balthiers presence in Final Fantasy XII helped ease some fans dislike of the [...] "angsty teen" [...] behavior of the main character Vaan. PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that while Vaan is the main character, he usually takes a back seat, adding that Balthier is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male lead. For similar reasons, GameZone listed Balthier as the tenth best Final Fantasy character, emphasizing how Balthier becomes [...] "as much the leading man as Vaan." [...] PALGN's Phil Larsen commented that though a lofty prediction, he expected that the duo of Balthier and Fran would [...] "go {{down in history as}} one of the greatest duos of modern narrative storytelling". Balthier ranked ninth on IGN's top 25 best Final Fantasy characters, ranking higher than any other character from Final Fantasy XII. Editor Dave Smith commented that he makes a [...] "convincing case" [...] that he is the main hero, upstaging fellow playable characters due to his [...] "sharp looks and even sharper wit." [...] GamesRadar'sAJ Glasser listed Balthier and Fran as one of her favourite Final Fantasy couples, describing theirs as being a well-balanced relationship. Destructoid's Aaron Linde noted that few video game characters had both his intelligence and his common sense, and wished more male characters in gaming could be like him.|$|E
500|$|David Fricke, in {{his review}} for the {{magazine}} Rolling Stone, considers Imaginos [...] "the best black-plastic blitz to bear the Cult's trademark cross and claw since 1974's Secret Treaties", but remarks that the [...] "lengthy gestation" [...] of the album and the many musicians involved makes it [...] "a bit of a cheat for Cult Purists", and that is [...] "only an illusionary re-creation of the way BÖC used to be". William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Imaginos is [...] "the album that comes closest to defining Blue Öyster Cult" [...] and their [...] "creative swan song", and [...] "perhaps BÖC's most consistent album, certainly its most uncompromising (...) and also <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> real heavy-metal statement from a band that never quite fit that description". For Don Kaye of Kerrang!, the album is [...] "the best BÖC slab since (...) Cultösaurus Erectus and harks back in style and attitude towards the brilliance of masterpieces like Secret Treaties and Spectres". A contrary evaluation comes from Blue Öyster Cult biographer Martin Popoff, who has [...] "come to dismiss it as somewhat of a sell-out". Despite it being [...] "the band's heaviest, fulfilling many a fan’s wish for sustained metal", Popoff finds [...] "the whole thing {{perched on the edge}} of parody, too dressy and fantastical lyrically in a painfully self-conscious way, (...) a laborious exercise in expected weird", ultimately [...] "a baffling yet anticlimactic punctuation to the band’s perplexed career". A reviewer from the Italian music criticism site Storia della Musica points out that the album is now a 'cult' item for its rarity, its content and the scarce love shown by the band for this work. He writes that [...] "it could have been the Tommy or The Dark Side of the Moon of BÖC" [...] but, [...] "despite the profound influences it evokes", its [...] "mutilated and sabotaged form" [...] and the disinterest of the musicians involved makes Imaginos only a wasted opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|The album's first single, [...] "The Day That Never Comes", was {{described}} by BBC Music as <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ballad on the album.

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album has been generally mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 50, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on 11 reviews.
