Methods: We selected 'Diagnosis-Related Groups' (DRG) of disorders {{that are associated with}} chronic abdominal pain from a large teaching hospital and a tertiary referral centre. For each DRG we determined the percentage of patients that can present with abdominal pain. The total costs for both hospitals were calculated using the registered quantity of the DRGs. Each DRG was categorised by somatic and functional origin. The results were subsequently extrapolated to the entire Dutch population demanding hospital care for chronic abdominal pain. Finally, the percentage and associated costs were calculated for patients who had two or more separate diagnoses for chronic abdominal pain in the field of gastroenterology, gynaecology, internal medicine and urology. Results: The yearly outpatient and (day) clinical health costs for patients with chronic abdominal pain in the Netherlands were approximately € 623 million (gastroenterology € 226 million; gynaecology € 303 million; internal medicine € 63 million; and urology € 31 million).

Using a 60 kHz transducer, AE levels were recorded for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 termites per block. The association of AE and varying numbers of drywood termites best fit an exponential curve. These {{data suggest that the}} detection capabilities of AE increase with increasing numbers of termites. The implications of this finding to the potential use of AE in detecting termites under field conditions are discussed. In California, as many as 73 species of insects have been reported to cause damage to wooden structures (Ebeling 1975). Of these species, the subterranean termite Reticulitermes hesperus Banks and the drywood termite Incisitermes minor (Hagen) have had the greatest economic impact. Each year, more than 1. 5 million inspection reports on termites and other wood-damaging pests are filed with the California Structural Pest Control Board (SPCB). Notices of Corrective Actions against these pests annually exceed 250, 000, and <b>the</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>costs</b> of these inspections and control measures exceed $ 350 million (Brier and others 1988).

40|$|Consequences of {{classical}} swine fever (CSF) epidemics depend on the control measures, {{but also on the}} number of infected herds {{at the end of the}} high-risk period (HRP). Surveillance programmes aim to keep this number as low as possible, so the effectiveness of surveillance programmes can be measured by the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. In this paper, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the following five Dutch CSF surveillance programmes is presented: (1) routine gross pathology of severely diseased pigs; (2) routine virological tests of tonsils of all pigs, submitted under 1; (3) daily clinical observation by the farmer; (4) periodic clinical inspection by a veterinarian; (5) leucocyte counts in blood samples from diseased animals on a herd where antimicrobial 'group therapy' is started. The evaluation was done by a modelling study, in which virus transmission, disease development, and actions and diagnostic tests in surveillance programmes were simulated. Also, <b>the</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>costs</b> of the programmes were calculated, and direct costs of CSF epidemics were related to the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. It appeared that the current Dutch surveillance programmes, without the leucocyte counts, keep the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP below 20 with 95 % probability. Leaving out the most-expensive programme of periodic inspection (12. 5 M¿ per year) does not change this result - indicating that (for CSF surveillance) the programme could well be stopped. If the leucocyte programme, which is currently not effective due to the low sample submission rate, optimally were applied, the 95 th percentile could be reduced to 10 infected herds. However, whether application is beneficial is unclear, because of uncertainty of the economic benefits due to the many expected false-positive herds each year...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of animal}} {{productivity}} on {{the costs of}} complying with environmental legislation in Dutch dairy farming P. B. M. Berentsen, Farm Management Group, Wageningen University, Hollandseweg 1, 6706 KN Wageningen, The Netherlands Available online 20 November 2003. Abstract Dutch dairy farmers have to comply with two policies that aim to reduce losses of nitrogen and phosphate to soil and ground water. The first policy (Mineral Accounting System, MINAS) uses a farm gate balance approach for registering nutrient input and output and consequently nutrient surpluses. Surpluses above an acceptable level are taxed. The second policy (Manure Transfer Agreement System, MTAS) aims at restricting manure application by requiring a manure transfer agreement for manure that is produced on the farm but cannot be applied according to maximum application rates. A possible way to meet both policies is to increase animal productivity in order to complete the milk quota with a smaller herd. This paper explores the impact of increasing animal productivity on economic results of dairy farms of different intensities taking into account environmental policies and a restricting quota. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>costs</b> of extra quota are determined below which it is more interesting to buy extra milk quota in response to increasing milk production per cow than to decrease the number of cows. A linear programming model of a dairy farm is {{used to examine the}} economic and environmental effects of improved productivity for three farms differing in intensity. From the results, it appears that an improvement of dairy cow productivity leads to considerably lower costs of meeting the environmental policies. From the economic values (EV) of milk production under the 2003 environmental legislation follows that farms with a low intensity can pay three times as much for additional quota than high intensity farms.

40|$|Background: Several {{surveys in}} the last 50 years have {{repeatedly}} indicated that Belgium is affected by mild iodine deficiency. Within {{the framework of the}} national food and health plan in Belgium, a selective, progressive, and monitored strategy was proposed in 2009 to optimize iodine intake. The objective {{of the present study was}} to perform a health economic evaluation of the consequences of inadequate iodine intake in Belgium, focusing on undisputed and measurable health outcomes such as thyroid nodular disease and its associated morbidity (hyperthyroidism). Methods: For the estimation of direct, indirect, medical, and nonmedical costs related to thyroid nodular diseases in Belgium, data from the Federal Public Service of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, the National Institute for Disease and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI), the Information Network about the prescription of reimbursable medicines (FARMANET), Intercontinental Marketing Services, and expert opinions were used. These costs translate into savings after implementation of the iodization program and are defined as costs due to thyroid nodular disease throughout the article. Costs related to the iodization program are referred to as program costs. Only figures dating from before the start of the intervention were exploited. Only adult and elderly people (>= 18 years) were taken into account in this study because thyroid nodular diseases predominantly affect this age group. Results: <b>The</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>costs</b> due to thyroid nodular diseases caused by mild iodine deficiency in the Belgian adult population are similar to(sic) 38 million. It is expected that the iodization program will result in additional costs of similar to(sic) 54, 000 per year and decrease the prevalence of thyroid nodular diseases by 38 % after a 4 - 5 -year period. The net savings after establishment of the program are therefore estimated to be at least (sic) 14 million a year. Conclusions: Optimization of iodine intake in Belgium should be quite cost effective, if only considering its impact on nodular thyroid disease. There are likely added benefits relating to more optimal thyroid hormone influenced brain development that are more difficult to estimate but may be even more important...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that optimal greenhouse design must account for (and be combined to) optimal climate management. We prove this by showing that different strategies and set-points to control the greenhouse ventilators result in different ¿optimal sets¿ of design parameters. We determined these optimal sets for a passive greenhouse in Almería, Spain where tomatoes were grown. The greenhouse design parameters investigated in this research were: 1) the transmission of the cover for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), 2) the transmission of near infrared (NIR) radiation and 3) the emission coefficient for longwave radiation of the cover. Six optimal sets of design parameters were determined by maximising the marginal revenues (crop yield minus costs of design parameters), under given climate conditions, and for different ventilation control strategies. Each ventilation control strategy had different set-points for the air temperature and carbon dioxide concen¬tration to control the greenhouse ventilators. To solve this optimization problem we used a dynamic crop-greenhouse model and an optimization algorithm. The model described the combined influence of the relevant design parameters, outdoor climate and ventilation control upon economic crop yield, through their effect on indoor climate. <b>The</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>costs</b> of the design parameters were empirically derived from prices, physical properties and lifespan of a number of greenhouse cover materials. Results showed that indeed for different strategies and set-points to control the green¬house ventilators different ¿optimal sets¿ of design parameters and marginal revenues were obtained. For example, the difference between the highest optimal NIR trans¬mission 1. 00 and the lowest optimal NIR transmission 0. 40 was 60 %, while the highest marginal revenues 16. 94 ¿m- 2 differed 18, 7 % with the lowest marginal revenues of 13. 77 ¿ m- 2. Additionally, it was found that the cover design parameters were time dependent. In conclusion, only a combined optimal control and design approach that takes into account the best climate control strategy and the time dependency of the design parameters will ensure optimal design parameters and maximum marginal revenues...|$|E
40|$|A strong {{increase}} of onshore and {{offshore wind power}} capacities is an official political target in Germany and other countries. The wind energy shares therefore rise in many power systems. Wind power generation has other characteristics than the power generation by conventional power plants. The wind is a natural resource that is fluctuating. The meteorological dependency leads to a limited predictability of the available power. A third aspect is the concentration of wind farms at locations with high wind yields as in the North of Germany. From a methodological point of view, the thesis focuses on {{the analysis of the}} three aspects with regard to the power system operation and the development of related modelling approaches. This especially refers to the application of a stochastic optimization model for the system analysis and to the simulation of wind power generation and wind power forecasts. The application orientated focus is on a scenario analysis of the German power system in 2020. The analysis aims at the identification of promising system adaptations that lead to an improved wind power integration and a more efficient power system operation. Before the model presentation, the importance of the three aspects above is discussed giving the basics for the latter modelling. It is shown that the residual load fluctuations are increased by the wind power generation, especially if they are related to the residual load levels. The flexibility of thermal power plants is also regarded here. An analysis of operational uncertainties shows the importance of wind power forecast errors in relation to load forecast errors. The DC load flow model and characteristics of the transmission grid are explained. A stochastic market model is presented that allows an integrative analysis of the wind power integration. One characteristic of the optimization model is the application of a rolling planning so that forecast errors can be specifically considered. A main modification of the model compared to earlier model versions is given by the representation of grid constraints. A grid reduction approach is developed that reduces the transmission grid to a simplified structure that is applied in the market model. The grid reduction approach is based on a comparison of DC load flow solutions in the reduced and unreduced grid. Additionally, an approach for the calculation of tertiary reserves is given. The approach considers the wind forecast quality and combines probabilistic elements with an optimization. The simulation of wind power generation and forecasts combines different analyses and methods. General quantitative relations between the variability of wind power generation and the geographical region size are derived. The equations are applied in the simulation of wind power generation that is based on adapted wind power curves. The adapted power curves consider regional smoothing effects in the transformation of wind speed to wind power. The simulation results reflect the high variability of the concentrated offshore wind power. For the simulation of the wind power forecasts, a scenario generation method based on moment matching is presented that allows simulating non Gaussian distributed forecast errors and their correlations. The results of a statistical analysis of measured forecast errors are used in the simulation. An empirical relation between error correlation and geographical distance is for example given. The German forecast quality that is simulated for 2020 assuming an improvement of forecasting by 20 % is, related to the installed capacity, similar to the one of today due to the high spatial concentration of the offshore capacities. For the scenario analysis of the power system in 2020, the power plant portfolios of twelve German regions and other parameters are derived based on different sources. This includes reserve requirement values and reduced grid parameters that are calculated by the methods mentioned above. The results show that, in the regarded scenario, 3 % of the yearly wind energy cannot be integrated into the system. They are curtailed nearly exclusively due to transmission constraints. The network congestions also lead to high differences between the regional electricity prices. <b>The</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>costs</b> of wind forecast errors amount to circa 180 million Euros or 1 % of the operational system costs. The model results thereby indicate a large cost saving potential by risk management methods. Based on scenario modifications, integration measures related to CAES capacities, demand side management and more flexible power plants as well as infrastructural changes by grid expansions and an adapted geographical allocation of power plants are analysed. The importance of a stochastic modelling approach for the evaluation of flexibility related scenarios is shown. The comparison of the integration measures identifies infrastructural changes as most efficient system improvements whereas the benefits of CAES capacities are small. Assuming a grid without any transmission constraints, the yearly system costs are reduced by one billion Euros. A limited grid upgrade leads to 10 % of this cost reduction. Similar cost savings are achieved by adapting the geographical locations of the power plants. Adjusting the generation to the grid is therefore a promising alternative to grid expansions especially considering the long processes that are involved with new transmission lines. A market design with regional electricity prices would give related incentives. Ein starker Ausbau der Windenergie, onshore und offshore, ist ein erklärtes politisches Ziel in Deutschland und anderen Ländern. Der Windenergieanteil nimmt folglich in immer mehr Stromsystemen zu. Die Stromerzeugung durch Windenergie weist andere Eigenschaften auf als sie beim Betrieb konventioneller Kraftwerke gegeben sind. Die Erzeugung beruht auf der natürlichen Ressource Wind und ist daher fluktuierend. Die meteorologische Abhängigkeit führt auch zu einer begrenzten Prognostizierbarkeit des verfügbaren Stromes. Ein dritter Aspekt ist die Konzentration der Windenergieanlagen an windreichen Standorten wie im Norden Deutschlands. Die Arbeit verfolgt zunächst das methodische Ziel, diese drei Aspekte bei der Analyse des Strombetriebs greifbar zu machen und geeignete Ansätze für die Strommarktmodellierung zu entwickeln. Dies betrifft insbesondere die Simulation der Windstromerzeugung und Windstromprognosen und die Anwendung eines stochastischen Optimierungsmodells zur Systemanalyse. Außerdem wird das anwendungsorientierte Ziel verfolgt, verschiedene Szenarien des deutschen Stromsystems für das Jahr 2020 zu untersuchen. Vielversprechende Systemanpassungen für eine verbesserte Integration der Windenergie und einen effizienteren Strombetrieb sind dabei zu identifizieren. Vor der Methodenentwicklung und Anwendung des Strommarktmodells wird zunächst die Bedeutung der drei obengenannten Aspekte erörtert und die Grundlage für dianpassungen hinsichtlich des Einsatzes von CAES Speicherkraftwerken, Demand Side Mangagement und flexiblerer Kraftwerke sowie Änderungen der Infrastruktur durch Netzausbauten und einer angepassten geographischen Allokation von Kraftwerken untersucht. Die Ergebnisse belegen die Vorteile eines stochastischen Marktmodellierungsansatzes für die Evaluierung flexibilitätsbezogener Integrationsmaßnahmen. Der Vergleich der Integrationsmaßnahmen identifiziert infrastrukturelle Maßnahmen als wirksamste Systemverbesserung, während der Nutzen zusätzlicher CAES Speicherkapazitäten gering ist. Unter der Annahme eines Netzes ohne Übertragungsengpässe reduzieren sich die jährlichen Systembetriebskosten um eine Milliarde Euro. In einem moderateren Netzausbauszenario lassen sich nur 10 % dieser Einsparung realisieren. Eine Kostenreduktion in ähnlicher Höhe wird durch eine angepasste Standortwahl neuer Kraftwerke erreicht. Eine Anpassung der Stromerzeugung an die Netzsituation ist demnach eine vielversprechende Alternative zu Netzausbauten, die vor allem auch wegen der langwierigen Prozesse beim Bau neuer Netzleitungen interessant ist. Ein regionales Preismodell würde dafür Anreize schaffen...|$|E
