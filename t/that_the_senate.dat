5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E

500|$|Irving {{was still}} in London when Van Buren {{received}} word <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States <b>Senate</b> had refused to confirm him as the new Minister. Consoling Van Buren, Irving predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> partisan move would backfire.

5|$|The Honolulu Advertiser {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Democratic leadership reconsidered {{their support}} for the bill because of the large demonstration of opponents and their pressure on senators to oppose the bill. It found that some senators privately suggested the bill's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to the bill were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in 2001, Bush stated his {{opposition}} to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the world's population and would have cost {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. He also cited <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|After further refusals {{from the}} USAF and DoD {{to provide the}} four {{officers}} for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline passed without the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate subpoenas directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Senate</b> has fared better in revising legislation than in representing regional interests. Any attempt to modify <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> role must take this fact into consideration. The author does precisely that in proposing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> seats should be realloted {{taking into account}} regional disparities, that Senators should be nominated by the provinces and, finally, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> powers should be reduced at a political level but increased to ensure proper representation of regional interests...|$|R

5|$|The Pisones {{had been}} {{longtime}} {{supporters of the}} Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius. Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps {{to the death of}} Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> was against him, Piso committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} and {{powers of the}} Indiana General Assembly are established in the state constitution. The General Assembly has sole legislative power within the state government. Each house can initiate legislation, with the exception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> is not permitted to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each law passed by the General Assembly must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the General Assembly has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E
5|$|To the north, Stefan Crnojević did {{not keep}} {{relations}} with Alfonso. Instead, he allied himself with Venice which gave him the Flag of St. Marc to bear. Crnojević thus became a Venetian vassal, who promised to protect Albania Veneta from Serbian and Turkish attacks. Skanderbeg grew agitated from the Venetian subtleties and threatened a renewed war against Venice under the pretext <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> had not been annually paying the 1,400 ducats promised to the Albanian in 1448. He had already moved his men towards Durazzo and Scutari, leaving the Republic with {{no choice but to}} ease their secretive diplomacy.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This was more of a triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E
5000|$|The {{documentary}} criticizes Senator Christopher Dodd {{and other}} government officials for benefiting from exclusive financial programs; Moore lambasts Dodd in particular for predatory lending as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Banking Committee. <b>The</b> AP reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interest rates and fees involved were norms for <b>the</b> industry, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> Select Committee on Ethics cleared Dodd and Kent Conrad of getting special treatments, but it cautioned the senators to exercise [...] "more vigilance" [...] with such deals.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor {{leadership}} {{decided to}} introduce a motion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator Doug McClelland, manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader Reg Withers of Labor's intent at about 1.30. Withers then attended a leadership meeting and learned of Fraser's appointment; he assured the new Prime Minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, Ken Wriedt, made the motion. Even as Wriedt did so, {{he was told that}} the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15pm, by which time {{it was too late to}} withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24pm, Labor's appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the signing}} of the treaty, Tyler {{complied}} with the Texans' demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico. In the event <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler's cabinet was split on the administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.|$|E

25|$|Rutledge {{also argued}} that if either house of the {{legislature}} {{was to have the}} sole authority to introduce appropriation bills, it should be the Senate. He noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> would be better able to think clearly about what the consequences of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the House of Representatives, he concluded {{that there would be no}} danger of the Senate ruling the country.|$|E

50|$|Beck {{and other}} Teamster leaders {{subsequently}} challenged {{the authority of}} the Permanent Subcommittee to investigate the union by arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> Labor and Public Welfare Committee had jurisdiction over labor racketeering, not Government Operations. McClellan objected to the transfer of his investigation to the Labor Committee because he felt the Labor chairman, Senator John F. Kennedy, was too close to union leaders and would not thoroughly investigate organized labor.|$|R
