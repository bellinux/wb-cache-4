40|$|Synthesis of DC-to-DC {{converter}} topologies in the {{two largest}} families - PWM and Quasi-Resonant (QR) - is completed in this thesis In a PWM converter, two linear time-invariant networks, consisting of only capacitors and inductors, source and load, are switched at constant frequency with duty ratio D. From defining assumptions, several general properties of PWM converter networks are derived. The established general properties interrelate the number of elements, attainable DC conversion ratio M(D), and features such as continuous terminal currents or possible coupling of inductors. Based on matrix representation of the converter topology, the systematic synthesis procedure for generation of PWM converters with a given number of reactive elements is constructed. A prescribed set of requirements is the input for the procedure. The requirements may include desired DC conversion ratio, continuous terminal currents, possible coupling of inductors and a given number of switches. In particular, the number of switches implemented as transistors can be specified. Outputs of the procedure are complete classes of PWM converters that satisfy the input requirements. A number of useful PWM topologies, which have not been identified before, are uncovered. A comparison {{of members of the}} classes is included. Several extensions of PWM converters are considered, including insertion of the isolation transformer and two discontinuous operating modes for which unified DC analyses are completed. Quasi-Resonant converters are defined as two-switch PWM converter networks to which resonant elements are added. Synthesis of QR, converters is based on the recognition that there are only a finite number of topologically distinct positions for resonant elements within a two-switch PWM parent converter. If a single resonant inductor and a single resonant capacitor are added to a two-switch PWM <b>topology,</b> <b>examination</b> of all possible positions yields a total of six QR classes, which come in dual pairs. Two pairs are identified as known QR classes, namely, Zero-Current/Zero-Voltage (ZV/ZC) and Zero-Current/Zero-Voltage Quasi-Square-Wave (ZC-QSW/ZV-QSW). The remaining two classes, named Off-Resonant and On-Resonant Quasi-PWM (Q[f]-PWM/Q[n]-PWM), have not been recognized so far. The names originate from the fact that Q-PWM converters can be regarded as PWM converters operating in both discontinuous modes simultaneously. The synthesis procedure can be generalized to encompass additional resonant elements. As an example, classes of Zero-Current and Zero-Voltage Multi-Resonant (ZC-MR/ZV-MR) converters are formally defined. In contrast to square-wave switch waveforms in PWM converters, all QR topologies exhibit smooth quasi-sinusoidal waveforms and therefore reduced switching losses. Of particular interest are operating modes in which all switching transitions are at zero current or at zero voltage. A study of operating modes and a DC analysis unified with respect to all PWM parents and all topological variations are carried out for four selected classes of QR Converters - Q[n]-PWM, ZV, ZV-QSW, and ZV-MR. It is emphasized that for a QR converter, topology alone is not sufficient to derive DC conversion properties. Subject to different switch implementations and control timing, the emerging operating modes can result in vastly different behavior of the same converter topology. Two switch implementations are considered - conventional, with one controllable switch and one diode, and the one that resembles the technique of synchronous rectification - with two controllable switches. In the first case, with the exception of converters in two Q-PWM classes, only variable-frequency control is applicable. However, if both switches are controllable, constant-frequency control is restored in all QR classes, and several novel operating modes of practical interest are uncovered. Various QR classes and operating modes are compared with respect to sets of switching transitions, sensitivity to parasitic elements, available operating region, frequency range and stresses on switching devices. The role of free parameters in various design trade-offs is exposed, thus allowing a designer to select and realize the topology best suited for a particular application...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. — Assessment of the {{reliability}} of a given phylogenetic hypothesis {{is an important step}} in phylogenetic analysis. Historically, the nonparametric bootstrap procedure has been the most frequently used method for assessing the support for specific phylogenetic relationships. The recent employment of Bayesian methods for phylogenetic inference problems has resulted in clade support being expressed in terms of posterior probabilities. We used simulated data and the four-taxon case to explore the relationship between nonparametric bootstrap values (as inferred by maximum likelihood) and posterior probabilities (as inferred by Bayesian analysis). The results suggest a complex association between the two measures. Three general regions of tree space can be identified: (1) the neutral zone, where differences between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values are not significant, (2) near the two-branch corner, and (3) deep in the two-branch corner. In the last two regions, significant differences occur between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values. Whether bootstrap or posterior probability values are higher depends on the data in support of alternative <b>topologies.</b> <b>Examination</b> of star <b>topologies</b> revealed that both bootstrap and posterior probability values differ significantly from theoretical expectations...|$|R
40|$|The four-alpha-helix bundle, {{a common}} {{structural}} motif in globular proteins, {{provides an excellent}} forum for the examination of predictive constraints for protein backbone <b>topology.</b> An exhaustive <b>examination</b> of the Brookhaven Crystallographic Protein Data Bank and other literature sources has lead {{to the discovery of}} 20 putative four-alpha-helix bundles. Application of an analytical method that examines the difference between solvent-accessible surface areas in packed and partially unpacked bundles reduced the number of structures to 16. Angular requirements further reduced the list of bundles to 13. In 12 of these bundles, all pairs of neighboring helices were oriented in an anti-parallel fashion. This distribution is in accordance with structure types expected if the helix macro dipole effect makes a substantial contribution to the stability of the native structure. The characterizations and classifications made in this study prompt a reevaluation of constraints used in structure prediction efforts...|$|R

The binding of viral coat glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to sialylated glycan receptors on host epithelial cells is the critical initial step in the infection and transmission of these viruses.

However, {{studies have shown that the}} classification of glycan binding preference of HA based on sialic acid linkage alone is insufficient to establish a correlation between receptor specificity of HA and the efficient transmission of influenza A viruses.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{permanent}} magnet "direct drive" electrical {{generators for wind turbines}} with large power output. A variety of such generator topologies is reviewed, tested and optimised {{in an attempt}} to increase their potential as commercial concepts for the wind industry. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to gearbox drivetrains. This novel technology reduces energy loses thus allowing more energy to be yield from the wind and decreases the maintenance cost at the same time. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transport and assembly. A number of structural designs have been suggested in the literature in an attempt to minimise this attribute. A set of design tools are set out in an attempt to investigate the structural stiffness of the different permanent magnet direct drive generator topologies against a number of structural stresses that apply to such wind turbine energy converters. Optimisation techniques, both analytical and structural, are also developed for minimising the total mass of a variety of "directly driven" machines with power output of 5 MW or greater. Conventional and promising generator designs are modelled and optimised with the use of these optimisation techniques. The <b>topologies</b> under <b>examination</b> are then compared in terms of structural mass, stiffness and cost. As the number of wind turbine manufactures who adopt the direct drive concept increases, it is important to outline the unique characteristics of the different topologies and increase their manufacturing potential. Discussions and conclusions will provide an indication of the design solutions that could help decrease the mass and cost of such machines...|$|R
40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) {{have become}} increasingly important in view of their promise of ubiquitous connectivity beyond traditional fixed infrastructure networks. Such networks, consisting of potentially highly mobile nodes, have provided new challenges by introducing special consideration stemming from the unique characteristics of the wireless medium and the dynamic nature of the network topology. The TCP protocol, which has been widely deployed on a multitude of internetworks including the Internet, is naturally viewed as the de facto reliable transport protocol for use in MANETs. However, assumptions made at TCP’s inception reflected characteristics of the prevalent wired infrastructure of networks {{at the time and}} could subsequently lead to sub-optimal performance when used in wireless ad hoc environments. The basic presupposition underlying TCP congestion control is that packet losses are predominantly an indication of congestion in the network. The detrimental effect of such an assumption on TCP’s performance in MANET environments has been a long-standing research problem. Hence, previous work has focused on addressing the ambiguity behind the cause of packet loss as perceived by TCP by proposing changes at various levels across the network protocol stack, such as at the MAC mechanism of the transceiver or via coupling with the routing protocol at the network layer. The main challenge addressed by the current work is to propose new methods to ameliorate the illness-effects of TCP’s misinterpretation of the causes of packet loss in MANETs. An assumed restriction on any proposed modifications is that resulting performance increases should be achievable by introducing limited changes confined to the transport layer. Such a restriction aids incremental adoption and ease of deployment by requiring minimal implementation effort. Further, the issue of packet loss ambiguity, from a transport layer perspective, has, by definition, to be dealt with in an end-to-end fashion. As such, a proposed solution may involve implementation at the sender, the receiver or both to address TCP shortcomings. Some attempts at describing TCP behaviour in MANETs have been previously reported in the literature. However, a thorough enquiry into the performance of those TCP agents popular in terms of research and adoption has been lacking. Specifically, very little work has been performed on an exhaustive analysis of TCP variants across different MANET routing protocols and under various mobility conditions. The first part of the dissertation addresses this shortcoming through extensive simulation evaluation in order to ascertain the relative performance merits of each TCP variant in terms of achieved goodput over dynamic <b>topologies.</b> Careful <b>examination</b> reveals sub-par performance of TCP Reno, the largely equivalent performance of NewReno and SACK, whilst the effectiveness of a proactive TCP variant (Vegas) is explicitly stated and justified {{for the first time in}} a dynamic MANET environment. Examination of the literature reveals that in addition to losses caused by route breakages, the hidden terminal effect contributes significantly to non-congestion induced packet losses in MANETs, which in turn has noticeably negative impact on TCP goodput. By adapting the conservative slow start mechanism of TCP Vegas into a form suitable for reactive TCP agents, like Reno, NewReno and SACK, the second part of the dissertation proposes a new Reno-based congestion avoidance mechanism which increases TCP goodput considerably across long paths by mitigating the negative effects of hidden terminals and alleviating some of the ambiguity of non-congestion related packet loss in MANETs. The proposed changes maintain intact the end-to-end semantics of TCP and are solely applicable to the sender. The new mechanism is further contrasted with an existing transport layer-focused solution and is shown to perform significantly better in a range of dynamic scenarios. As solution from an end-to-end perspective may be applicable to either or both communicating ends, the idea of implementing receiver-side alterations is also explored. Previous work has been primarily concerned with reducing receiver-generated cumulative ACK responses by “bundling” them into as few packets as possible thereby reducing misinterpretations of packet loss due to hidden terminals. However, a thorough evaluation of such receiver-side solutions reveals limitations in common evaluation practices and the solutions themselves. In an effort to address this shortcoming, the third part of this research work first specifies a tighter problem domain, identifying the circumstances under which the problem may be tackled by an end-to-end solution. Subsequent original analysis reveals that by taking into account optimisations possible in wireless communications, namely the partial or complete omission of the RTS/CTS handshake, noticeable improvements in TCP goodput are achievable especially over long paths. This novel modification is activated in a variety of topologies and is assessed using new metrics to more accurately gauge its effectiveness in a wireless multihop environment.
