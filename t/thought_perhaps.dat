5|$|The {{population}} of Hiroshima {{had reached a}} peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At {{the time of the}} attack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others <b>thought</b> <b>perhaps</b> their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks, beginning in 1944. Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.|$|E
25|$|Buried Viking treasures {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} silver {{have been found}} in the Low Countries. Two such treasures {{have been found in}} Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is <b>thought</b> <b>perhaps</b> to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.|$|E
25|$|Amir and 300 rebel {{soldiers}} were captured by Siliwangi troops on 1 December. Some 35,000 people were later arrested. It is <b>thought</b> <b>perhaps</b> 8,000 {{people were killed}} in the affair. As part of a second major military offensive against the Republic, on 19 December Dutch troops occupied Yogyakarta city and the Republican government was captured, including Sukarno, Hatta, Agus Salim, and Sjahrir. Republican forces withdraw to the countryside beginning full-scale guerrilla war {{on either side of the}} van Mook line. Rather than risk their release, the army killed Amir and fifty other leftist prisoners as it withdrew from Yogyakarta that evening.|$|E

25|$|The Union forces {{prepared}} to leave Hampton Roads on December 10, but a winter storm hit the fleet for three days, preventing the fleet's departure until the 14th. The transports carrying Butler's force arrived at Fort Fisher first, since the navy took longer to refuel at Beaufort than expected. When Porter's ships arrived on the 19th, another storm hit the fleet, causing some ships to scatter and forcing the army transports to return to Beaufort. After the storm subsided on the 23rd, Porter decided to start the attack without Butler, ordering the Louisiana to be blown up that night. Near midnight, the ship was towed close to the fort's seawall and set on fire. However, the Louisiana was farther out to sea than the navy <b>thought,</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{as far as a}} mile offshore; as a result, Fort Fisher was undamaged by the blast.|$|E

Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and <b>thought</b> <b>perhaps</b> we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't {{know how to handle}} murderers {{and they were going to}} show us." ...|$|E

She also wrote on her official website that the song is about raising money and awareness for what she considers to be an HIV/AIDS genocide. Citing Mandela's speech in which he said, [...] "Let us use the universal language of music, to sing out our message around the world", Lennox wanted [...] "Sing" [...] to be an anthem and symbol of unity and empowerment, to help spread awareness in the world. [...] "Because the incidence of HIV AIDS {{is on the rise}} for women, especially in the pandemic across the whole of the African continent, I <b>thought</b> <b>perhaps</b> I could be of benefit by writing a song and empowering those women who do not have an international voice," [...] the singer clarified.|$|E

Cade was {{appointed}} captain, Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F., on 1 July 1940 and posted to the 2nd/9th Field Ambulance. Although trained as a psychiatrist, Dr. Cade served as a surgeon and departed for Singapore in 1941 on RMS Queen Mary. [...] He was promoted to major in September 1941.
