5|$|Mosley {{identified}} {{his major}} achievement as FIA President as {{the promotion of}} the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP or Encap). He has also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing. In 2008, stories about his sex life appeared in the British press, along with unfounded allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood {{down at the end of}} his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, Jean Todt.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, both of Wiesenthal's {{employers}} terminated {{his services}} in 1960, {{as there were}} too few refugees left {{in the city to}} justify the expense. Wiesenthal opened a new documentation centre (the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime) in Vienna in 1961. He became a Mossad operative, for which he received the equivalent of several hundred dollars per month. He maintained files on hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals and located many, about six of whom were arrested {{as a result of his}} activities. Successes included locating and bringing to trial Erich Rajakowitsch, responsible for the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, and Franz Murer, the commandant of the Vilna Ghetto. In 1963 Wiesenthal read in <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> Karl Silberbauer, the man who had arrested famed diarist Anne Frank, had been located; he was serving on the police force in Vienna. Wiesenthal's publicity campaign led to Silberbauer being temporarily suspended from the force, but he was never prosecuted for arresting the Frank family.|$|E
25|$|Freema Agyeman {{told the}} school {{publication}} <b>The</b> <b>Newspaper</b> <b>that</b> Martha is {{older and more}} secure than Rose. Agyeman speculated that Martha, by contrast, travels with the Doctor for the adventure, rather than because of a need for guidance or education (Agyeman also told <b>The</b> <b>Newspaper</b> <b>that</b> Martha hopes to eventually go back to Earth and finish her medical education). In addition, Martha's family appears to be of a higher social class than Rose; whereas Rose's family was fairly typically working class, Martha's family appears to be wealthier (her father owns {{what appears to be}} a late model Mercedes-Benz convertible, and the clothes worn by her family are substantially more in line with fashion), probably middle to upper middle class.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Post {{made public}} the definitional change on April 18. A DCFEMS {{spokesperson}} subsequently {{admitted that the}} full-year arson closure rate was about 34 percent.

Aomame's close friendship with Ayumi makes her recall an earlier friend of hers who {{was the victim of}} domestic abuse and committed suicide because of it. Aomame and Ayumi remain friends until one day when Aomame reads in <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> Ayumi had been strangled to death in a hotel.|$|E
25|$|Reepalu later {{conceded that}} he has not been {{sufficiently}} informed about the vulnerable situation faced by Jews after meeting with community leaders. Reepalu then said that Skånska Dagbladet, <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> initially reported many Reepalu's controversial statements, had misrepresented him as antisemitic; the newspaper was subsequently banned from a press conference at City Hall, reportedly at Reepalu's request. In response, Skånska Dagbladet published on its website the full tapes of its interview with Ilmar Reepalu, as well as all the texts published in its article series on threats and harassment faced by Malmö Jews, and the exchange of emails between the newspaper and the mayor's office.|$|E

25|$|Dana {{made the}} Sun a Democratic newspaper, {{independent}} and outspoken in {{the expression of}} its opinions respecting the affairs of either party. His criticisms of civil maladministration during General Grant's terms as president led to a notable attempt {{on the part of}} that administration, in July 1873, to take him from New York on a charge of libel, to be tried without a jury in a Washington police court. Application was made to the United States District Court in New York for a warrant of removal, but in a memorable decision Judge Blatchford, later a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, refused the warrant, holding the proposed form of trial to be unconstitutional. Perhaps {{to a greater extent than}} in the case of any other conspicuous journalist, Dana's personality was identified in the public mind with <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> he edited.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Parks {{received}} an eviction notice from her $1800 per month apartment due to non-payment of rent. Parks {{was incapable of}} managing her own financial affairs by this time due to age-related physical and mental decline. Her rent was paid from a collection taken by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. When her rent became delinquent and her impending eviction was highly publicized in 2004, executives of the ownership company announced they had forgiven the back rent and would allow Parks, by then 91 and in extremely poor health, to live rent free in the building {{for the remainder of}} her life. Elaine Steele, who manages the nonprofit Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, told <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> Parks gets proper care and eviction notices were sent in error in 2002. Her heirs and various interest organizations alleged at the time that her financial affairs had been mismanaged.|$|E
25|$|A {{newspaper}} typically generates 70–80% of {{its revenue}} from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> is not advertising is called editorial content, editorial matter, or simply editorial, although the last term {{is also used to}} refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time– early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The business model of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by The Sun, a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{principal}} lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech, how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print.
