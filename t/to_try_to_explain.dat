5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition {{of anthropology}} as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E

Studies were made <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the change in behavior to an extremely high producer of rain. One area of Thornhill, just north of the Toronto City limits recorded 175mm (6.9") of rain in less than 1 hour.|$|E

Between 1976 and 1982, he wrote [...] "Fairlie at Large," [...] a {{bi-weekly}} column for The Washington Post. In those pieces he often abandoned political subjects to write about American manners and morals: for instance, why Americans would do well to give up showers in favor of more contemplative baths. His romantic attachment to the possibilities of American life found its fullest expression in a long essay titled [...] "Why I Love America," [...] which The New Republic published on July 4, 1983.|$|R
40|$|The {{macroporous}} {{materials are}} {{a mix of}} solid particles, joined together with bridges of materials {{that may be the}} same or different of the solid particles. For example, volcanic rocks like volcanic agglomerates. In this way, it is interesting <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how the collapse of these materials takes place. With the great improvement of the numerical methods and the power of computers it has been possible to carry out a discrete analysis instead of a continuum one, like would had happened with the classical theories of continuum.

25|$|The {{cause of}} {{the sinking of the}} Clan Ranald is still undetermined. Many {{theories}} have been put forward <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it. One of these theories was that the vessel struck Marion Reef. However, this was dismissed, as an inspection of the hull revealed that there were no holes that indicated that the vessel hit any underwater obstruction. Other theories include the water ballast tanks were not emptied or that the sea cock was opened throughout the journey. Some even suggested that most of the crew were drunk at that time.|$|E
25|$|The first {{measurements}} {{of the number of}} solar neutrinos reaching the earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the Standard Solar Model. As several experiments confirmed this deficit the effect became known as the solar neutrino problem. Over several decades many ideas were put forward <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the effect, one of which was the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations. All of the solar neutrino detectors prior to SNO had been sensitive primarily or exclusively to electron neutrinos and yielded little to no information on muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos.|$|E

25|$|Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was {{discovered}} by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> this phenomenon. He was disappointed {{to find that the}} cause was an experimental artifact — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Darwin’s {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} {{laid the groundwork for}} modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that heritable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all. This misunderstanding was called the inheritance of acquired characters and was part of the theory of transmutation of species put forward in 1809 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In the late 19th century this theory became known as Lamarckism. Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called pangenesis <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s August Weismann's experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favor.|$|E

This places her {{at odds with the}} SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her [...] "Angel" [...] since they do not know her real name, but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to understand what she is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. However, she often lacks a proper understanding of others, as she never thinks <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to the SSS why she was doing what she did.

2500|$|The {{idea that}} {{intention}} co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement {{is reminiscent of}} [...] "forward models of motor control" [...] (or FMMC, which have been used <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> inner speech). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they {{are in control of}} a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see self serving biases) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).|$|E
2500|$|Astrophysicist Jeanne Cavelos says in The Science of Star Wars {{that the}} Force raises {{questions}} that scientists have long asked. She {{points out that}} the ancient Greeks explored the idea of a [...] "fifth element" [...] that permeated and connected everything in the universe, and that Isaac Newton proposed that the human brain might be able to trigger waves in the ether, giving humans psychic powers. Cavelos's sources are mostly skeptical about a [...] "real world" [...] explanation for the Force, but they explore ideas in areas such as quantum physics, parapsychology, and the notion of science so advanced that it appears magical. Explaining the Force is particularly difficult, Cavelos says, because [...] "it does so many different things". Several scientists have said it is best not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how the Force works.|$|E
