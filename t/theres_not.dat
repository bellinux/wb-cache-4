60|$|REGINALD [lurching {{across the}} kitchen towards the hearth {{with his hands in}} his pockets] It's no use: they wont listen to our sort. [Turning on them] Of course they have to make you a Bishop and Boxer a General, because, after all, their blessed rabble of snobs and cads and half-starved shopkeepers cant do {{government}} work; and the bounders and week-enders are too lazy and vulgar. Theyd simply rot without us; but what do they ever do for us? what attention do they ever pay to what we say and what we want? I take it that we Bridgenorths are a pretty typical English family of the sort that has always set things straight and stuck up for the right to think and believe according to our conscience. But nowadays we are expected to dress and eat as the week-end bounders do, and to think and believe as the converted cannibals of Central Africa do, and to lie down and let every snob and every cad and every halfpenny journalist walk over us. Why, <b>theres</b> <b>not</b> a newspaper in England today that represents what I call solid Bridgenorth opinion and tradition. Half of them read as if they were published at the nearest mother's meeting, and the other half at the nearest motor garage. Do you call these chaps gentlemen? Do you call them Englishmen? I dont.[He throws himself disgustedly into the nearest chair].|$|E
60|$|THE ENVOY. Well, {{about this}} colonizing plan of yours. My {{father-in-law}} {{here has been}} telling me something about it; and he has just now let out that you want not only to colonize us, but to--to--to--well, shall we say to supersede us? Now why supersede us? Why not live and let live? <b>Theres</b> <b>not</b> a scrap of ill-feeling on our side. We should welcome a colony of immortals--we may almost call you that--in the British Middle East. No doubt the Turanian Empire, with its Mahometan traditions, overshadows us now. We have had to bring the Emperor {{with us on this}} expedition, though of course {{you know as well as}} I do that he has imposed himself on my party just to spy on me. I dont deny that he has the whip hand of us to some extent, because if it came to a war none of our generals could stand up against him. I give him best at that game: he is the finest soldier in the world. Besides, he is an emperor and an autocrat; and I am only an elected representative of the British democracy. Not that our British democrats wont fight: they will fight the heads off all the Turanians that ever walked; but then it takes so long to work them up to it, while he has only to say the word and march. But you people would never get on with him. Believe me, you would not be as comfortable in Turania as you would be with us. We understand you. We like you. We are easy-going people; and we are rich people. That will appeal to you. Turania is a poor place when all is said. Five-eighths of it is desert. They dont irrigate as we do. Besides--now I am sure this will appeal to you and to all right-minded men--we are Christians.|$|E

Seduce Me: The Spawn of Green Porno is a five-episode online series that premiered in mid-2010 and explores the topic of animal courtship—as with Green Porno, Rossellini wrote, directed, and acted in the series (she is also a producer of the series). Rossellini explained in 2010, [...] " [...] I always wanted to make films about animals-- <b>theres</b> <b>not</b> an enormous audience, but theres an enormous audience for sex." ...|$|E

Both the British and American press published elaborate plans of the base.

5000|$|Jesus Freak Hideouts Scott Fryberger {{said that}} [...] "Overall, while How to Be Loved is {{definitely}} a well-intentioned album, it ends up being just another seemingly lifeless contemporary album that wont really make any waves in the music realm. Again, I enjoy the lyrics I mentioned from [...] "Love Your Neighbor", {{as well as the}} John Mayer-esque [...] "Loved", which may be the strongest track on the album, but those are the only real highlights to speak of. Agnew also has a really strong voice that, in the right circumstances, can aid in making the songs more powerful. But in the end, <b>theres</b> <b>not</b> much else to praise about this album." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{award is}} {{annually}} {{given to the}} LCBL player with the most distinguished pitching season, regardless of role. This is solely determined by Pitcher Rating, a statistical equation created by Ross Clites in 2010. The formula takes into consideration individual winning percentage, saves (if any), strikeouts, ERA, WHIP, and a pitchers run support average per start. It takes the subjectivity out of performances that only come around once a week. This is especially essential for pitchers in a summer league, where <b>theres</b> <b>not</b> a sample size of 30+ games and 100+ at-bats to judge. No manager {{can see all the}} starts made by each ace, and there is no safety net for an off-day. Thus, No voting and highest PR value wins.|$|E

[...] The crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen, but Muirhead-Gould remained unconvinced and before he left, added sarcastically: [...] "If you see another sub, see if the captain has a black beard.
