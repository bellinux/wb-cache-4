30|$|Availability {{is quite}} often {{measured}} in downtime minutes, outage duration and frequency. A FIVE nine availability system allows for 5.24  minutes downtime per year. The distribution of these 5.24  minutes among various system components {{is not always}} a straightforward matter. Quite often the distribution of downtime minutes needs to be negotiated among the owners of system components. More interesting even is how the system gets partitioned into components or subsystems. The broadest partitioning is the typical hardware/software partitions. Such partition makes it very difficult to design for the proper recovery when a failure occurs. More detailed partitioning, however, makes it very difficult to achieve the required availability or outage requirement. An optimal distribution <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> among the various hardware and software components is a fine art orchestrated by expert system architects.|$|R

30|$|Synchronism {{checking}} {{might lead}} complicated procedure and malfunction. Therefore, the individual component {{as well as}} the whole system reliability should be considered. Synchronism checking relays have been produced by several companies and applied in the field. In particular, synchronism checking has been used in the reclosing of transmission lines, and no malfunction in synchronism checking has been reported. Also, with the development of digital signal processing technology, it is possible to accurately obtain the differences in voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase angle between two points. Therefore, this paper does not consider the reclosing failure due to the synchronism checking problems. The conventional distribution systems do not consider synchronism checking in reclosing procedure. If the BESS is disconnected from distribution system during fault, the BESS cannot be used for the UPS. In order to increase the utilization of BESS, the BESS should be connected during a fault, so the synchronism checking must be considered as discussed in introduction. The <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> faulty phase will be increased due to extra time for synchronism checking. However, the extra time for synchronism checking is actually very short due to a development of digital signal technology. In [23], a time delay of synchronism relay using in power networks is specified. Estabilization time of synchronism relay signals is 30  ms. Time for action of output unit of the synchronism relay is 30  ms. Time set in the synchronism relay for checking depends on the setting of operator, which has usually a delay of 100  ms [23]. Therefore, the closing time delay is usually 160  ms, i.e. about 10 cycles at 60  Hz. In our algorithm, the normal power is supplied to the load by BESS after opening of CB. After that, the time delay for synchronism checking between source and load sides is counted. Therefore, in the simulation results, the reclosing is performed within 1 / 2 cycles after fixed dead time (0.5 or 15  s). This is very short time delay. In other words, the increase <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> faulty phase at the proposed scheme will be very short comparing with the conventional reclosing scheme. In summary, by applying proposed reclosing scheme, the interruptions of healthy phases will be prevented and hence the reliability will improve. Also, the increase <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> faulty phase will not affect to the reliability.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a methodology to predict the reactivity impact as a function <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> between cycles <b>of</b> 3 He, 6 Li, and other poisons in the High Flux Isotope Reactor s (HFIR) beryllium reflector. The reactivity worth at startup of the HFIR has been incorrectly predicted in the past after the reactor has been shut-down for long periods of time. The incorrect prediction was postulated to be due to the erroneous calculation of 3 He buildup in the beryllium reflector. It is necessary to develop a better estimate of the start-of-cycle symmetric critical control element positions since if the estimated and actual symmetrical critical control element positions differ by more than $ 1. 55 in reactivity (approximately one-half inch in control element startup position), HFIR is to be shutdown and a technical evaluation is performed to resolve the discrepancy prior to restart. 3 He is generated and depleted during operation, but during an <b>outage,</b> the depletion <b>of</b> 3 He ceases because it is a stable isotope. 3 He is born from the radioactive decay of tritium, and thus the concentration of 3 He increases during shutdown. SCALE, specifically the TRITON and CSAS 5 control modules including the KENO V. A, COUPLE, and ORIGEN functional modules were utilized in this study. An equation relating the down time (td) to the change in symmetric control element position was generated and validated against measurements for approximately 40 HFIR operating cycles. The newly-derived correlation was shown to improve accuracy of predictions for long periods of down time...|$|R

40|$|As our {{electric}} power distribution infrastructure has aged, considerable investment {{has been applied}} to modernizing the electrical power grid through weatherization and in deployment of real-time monitoring systems. A key {{question is whether or not}} these investments are reducing the number and duration <b>of</b> power <b>outages,</b> leading to improved reliability. Statistical methods are applied to analyze electrical disturbance data (from the Department of Energy, DOE) and reliability index data (from state utility public service commission regulators) to detect signs of improvement. The number of installed smart meters provided by several utilities is used to determine whether the number of smart meters correlate with a reduction in outage frequency. Indication emerged that the number <b>of</b> power <b>outages</b> may be decreasing over time. The magnitude of power loss has decreased from 2003 to 2007, and behaves cyclically from 2008 to 2014, with a few outlier points in both groups. The duration also appears to be decreasing between 2003 - 2014. Large blackout events exceeding 5 GW continue to be rare, and certain power outage events are seasonally dependent. There was a linear relationship between the number of customers and the magnitude <b>of</b> a power <b>outage</b> event. However, no relationship was found between the magnitude <b>of</b> power <b>outages</b> and <b>time</b> to restore power. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>outages</b> maybe decreasing as the number of installed smart meters has increased.
