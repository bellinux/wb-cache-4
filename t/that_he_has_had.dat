Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
5|$|Sameer {{decides to}} leave Goa, and Sunny taunts {{him that he}} got close to Rani through Sameer's mistakes. Sameer says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> enough dreaming, and wishes Sunny happiness. Sunny taunts Sameer again, and Sameer loses his temper. He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a {{friendly}} match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents.

5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In the episode, SpongeBob is determined to have a perfect day. But much to his disappointment, however, the day refuses to go at all as he planned. Each of his friends has a different problem of his/her own, so he sets out to help them while spoiling his own agendas.

5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries {{to run away from}} any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises to the rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> sex with 480 women.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman {{begins in}} medias res with the upper-class Maria's unjust {{imprisonment}} by her husband, George Venables. Not only has he condemned Maria {{to live in}} an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is not mad, agrees to bring her a few books. Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his marginalia. The two begin to communicate and eventually meet. Darnford reveals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.|$|E
5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of The Witness for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and Blow {{and his team}} started looking at this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. At the time of this decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn about the upcoming PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> difficulties working with Microsoft in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through with Microsoft to release his earlier game, Braid. The Witness had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that Blow and his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the performance, a Patbot {{performs}} {{instead of}} Pat, unbeknown to the audience. Wilf, knowing {{it to be}} a robot (and not realising there is the real Pat too), tries to unmask the Patbot. Then, the real Pat interrupts the performance. As Carbunkle releases the first few Patbots to kill off Pat, Simon Cowbell and Mr Brown, revealing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> enough of them hindering his plans, Josh saves them.

25|$|Kotoōshū managed {{only three}} double-figure scores in 2006, and {{none at all}} in 2007, only doing enough to {{maintain}} his rank. Shortly before the November 2007 tournament he dislocated his right knee in training. Clearly troubled by the injury he pulled out on the 7th day, {{the first time in}} his career <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> to withdraw from a tournament.

25|$|She co-starred with Woody Allen in the 1991 film Scenes from a Mall, {{again for}} Paul Mazursky. In the film, Allen's {{character}} reveals to his author wife Deborah, played by Midler, {{after years of}} a happy marriage, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> an affair, resulting in her request for divorce. The movie performed poorly, and received a mixed reception by critics. Midler fared somewhat better with her other 1991 project For the Boys, on which she reteamed with The Rose director Mark Rydell. A historical musical drama, it {{tells the story of}} 1940s actress and singer Dixie Leonard, played by Midler, who teams up with Eddie Sparks, a famous performer to entertain American troops. While the film received a mixed reception from critics, Midler earned rave review for her portrayal.

50|$|The {{facts in}} {{evidence}} against John Williams were <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> {{an opportunity to}} take the maul, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> money after the murders but not before, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> returned to his room just after the killer <b>had</b> fled the second crime scene, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> bloody and torn shirts. Although an attempt was made to identify the maul and ascertain whether any of Williams's shirts <b>had</b> bloodstains on them, the courts could not assess forensic evidence and gave great weight to eyewitnesses' statements.|$|R
25|$|Monica Charles Brooks-Dent (played by Keesha Sharp) is William's wife. All {{four of the}} girlfriends (especially Lynn and Toni) {{hated her}} (Joan comes to see her {{vulnerable}} side and becomes her friend, and Toni moves to New York {{at the end of}} the sixth season). In the seventh season, they slowly and later fully accept Monica as their friend as Monica does the same. Although engaged to William, the two date twice before; they meet at a bar the first time. Since the last time William proposes to her in Monaco, he has occasionally had doubts about ever doing so. Eventually he marries her, but on their wedding day he has too much to drink and confesses <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> and still has doubts about marrying her. Monica leaves William in Season 7 but returns shortly after the girlfriends go to Chicago to persuade her to get back together with William. On their visit, they discover that Monica, due to her father's dementia and her mother's power of attorney, has been cut off from her family fortune, so Joan offers Monica a job at the J-Spot. William is thrilled about Monica's return until she demands half of what he earned while they were married. They manage to slowly rebuild their relationship but constantly clash at the J-Spot. In the Season 7 finale, they get back together. By Season 8, Monica was pregnant and is seen spending more time with the other three girlfriends, particularly Joan.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie has {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with employee, Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), eventually leading to Danielle being sacked and Ronnie publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen clutching a locket containing {{a photograph of}} Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's daughter. It transpires that Danielle {{is the result of}} a teenage romance between Ronnie and her first boyfriend, Joel Reynolds (Cavan Clerkin). Archie disapproved of the pregnancy and put Danielle—named Amy by Ronnie—up for adoption. Danielle was adopted by Lizzie and Andy Jones (Aneirin Hughes), and is now trying to locate her birth mother. On Archie and Peggy's wedding day, Danielle tells Ronnie that she is her daughter. Ronnie does not believe her because Archie told her that her daughter is dead, and throws her out. She later realises that Danielle was telling the truth and tries to apologise to Danielle but she is hit by Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) car and dies in Ronnie's arms. Danielle's adoptive father, Andy, comes to London to get her and takes Danielle's remains back to Telford and bans Ronnie from the funeral. Despite this, Ronnie goes to Telford and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) convinces Andy to talk to Ronnie about Danielle. Grieving for the daughter she was not allowed to raise, Ronnie becomes obsessed with having a baby. She tries tricking Jack into getting her pregnant and rekindles her romance with Joel until she learns <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> a vasectomy so Ronnie ends their relationship. She gets pregnant by Owen Turner (Lee Ross), but miscarries when Archie pushes her into the bar during an argument. Archie is later murdered and Ronnie is arrested as a suspect but released without charge. When Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering their father, Ronnie reveals that Archie raped Stacey, and did the same to her when she was 13.

He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he is talking about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper").

[...] In fact, Armey points to Jackson as an example of his ability to work with politicians at all ends of the political spectrum. [...] Jackson also has a very good relationship with Republican United States President George W. Bush despite their sharp ideological differences. [...] The relationship traces back to when Jackson Sr. and United States President-Elect George H. W. Bush met to discuss a range of issues while Jackson Jr. and his siblings Santita and Jonathan had an hour-and-a-half luncheon with future president George W. [...] He also developed a relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton that enabled him to watch Super Bowl XXXIII at Camp David with them.|$|E

He found guest roles on television shows but his first break came in 1999, {{after he was}} cast in a leading role on the short-lived but well-reviewed NBC television series Freaks and Geeks, which ran for 18 episodes and was canceled due to low viewership. Later, the show became a cult hit among audiences. He has since described the series as [...] "one of the most fun" [...] work experiences <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had.</b> In another interview, Franco said: [...] "When we were doing Freaks and Geeks, I didn’t quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn’t on me... So I was improvising a little bit back then, {{but not in a}} productive way." [...] After his film debut Never Been Kissed, he played a popular jock Chris in Whatever It Takes (2000), a modern-day remake of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac.|$|E
