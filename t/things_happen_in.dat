500|$|Valve {{aimed for}} a November 1997 release {{to compete with}} Quake II. By September 1997, the team found that while they had built a number of {{innovative}} aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion. The company postponed the release and reworked every level. They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game, and then spent a month iterating on the level. When {{the rest of the}} team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as [...] "Die Hard meets Evil Dead", they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, the level had a number of interesting <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> it and all when the player came into near proximity of the event, rather than based on time elements, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level had means to respond to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.|$|E
