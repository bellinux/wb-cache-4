5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} map {{itself of}} Europa Barbarorum covers a wider geographical area {{than that of}} Rome: Total War, expanding into {{areas such as the}} Arabian Peninsula, India, Central Asia, and Scandinavia. Relief, province boundaries, snow boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map. The Nile–Red Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea has been added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such as the Amber and Silk Roads, which can be captured and exploited by the player or by the artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The video then cuts {{to a shot}} of {{the band}} playing the game before {{returning}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again stands in front of the players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E

5|$|Wave 9 {{requires}} the player {{to cross a}} river of lava by stunning the monsters that live there. Once across, Jones must grab the Sankara Stones to progress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Map</b> Room where he can use the map pieces he has collected {{to figure out where}} the secret door exit is in Wave 10. Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass {{requires the}} use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the rope bridge and the final battle with Mola Ram.|$|E
5|$|Defense of the Ancients is {{maintained}} via official forums. Users can post ideas for new heroes or items, {{some of which}} are added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> Players have contributed icons and hero descriptions and created the artwork displayed while the map loads, and suggestions for changes to existing heroes or items are taken seriously; IceFrog once changed a new hero less than two weeks after the new version of the map was released. Versions of the scenario where enemy heroes are controlled by artificial intelligences have also been released. Mescon continued to maintain dota-allstars.com, which by the end of IceFrog's affiliation in May 2009 had over 1,500,000 registered users and had received over one million unique visitors every month. Due to their separation, IceFrog announced that he would be further developing a new official site, playdota.com, while continuing game development; Mescon closed dota-allstars on July 22, 2010, citing dropping statistics and his new passion for League of Legends as the reason for its end.|$|E
5|$|His {{expertise}} {{resulted in}} his being invited by Charles Close, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey (OS), to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer. Accepting the position, Crawford moved to Southampton and began {{work at the}} project in October 1920. His arrival at the OS generated some resentment, with co-workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be unimportant. His job entailed correcting and updating information about archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised, and involved him undertaking much fieldwork, travelling across the British landscape to check the location of previously recorded sites and discover new ones. He began in Gloucestershire in late 1920, visiting 208 sites around the Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> Based on his research in this region, in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
25|$|Cartographic {{symbology}} encodes {{information on}} the map in ways intended to convey information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E

25|$|Probabilistic methods aim to {{overcome}} the above issue, by producing robust estimates of the probabilities {{of each of the}} possible genotypes, taking into account noise, as well as other available prior information {{that can be used to}} improve estimates.

25|$|Players return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> screen if {{they all}} run out of lives, or if all players lose their lives at the same time, leaving no one to free them. For most levels, there is a midway flag that if touched will return the player to that point after dying and being sent back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> screen. Stages are {{completed}} by getting at least one player to touch the goal at the end, though a bonus is awarded if all players manage to grab hold of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. In a few levels, {{in addition to the}} normal goal and flag pole, there are alternative exits leading to a flag pole with a red flag. Reaching this goal will open up a new path on the map, leading to new stages on the overworld map and, in some worlds, a warp cannon (which will blast the player off to a later world).|$|E
25|$|The North London Line {{was added}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> in 1977. While run by British Rail, {{and later by}} Silverlink, it was shown in British Rail/National Rail colours, {{although}} its appearance was intermittent, being omitted from some map editions over the years. In November 2007 it {{was taken over by}} London Overground and changed to an orange double stripe. The semi-orbital route originally ran from Richmond to Broad Street, then Richmond to North Woolwich; today the line runs from Richmond to Stratford.|$|E
25|$|Limited-service routes have {{sometimes}} been identified with hatched lines, with some complications added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> to show where peak-only services ran through to branches, {{such as that}} to Chesham on the Metropolitan line.

25|$|Instead of {{following}} mostly linear paths inside predefined missions as in Star Fox 1, the player moves {{a team of}} two ships freely around a map screen that represents the Lylat system. When the player's ships make contact with enemy forces, the game switches to an action perspective, piloting the Arwing ship directly with controls and game play similar to the first Star Fox. When the player clears the specified objectives, {{he or she is}} taken back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> screen to select a new destination.|$|E
25|$|Although Qingjun's map is lost, a {{modified}} {{edition of the}} map is contained in the Shuidong Riji (水東日記) by the Ming period book collector Ye Sheng (葉盛) (1420–1474) {{under the name of}} Guanglun Jiangli Tu (廣輪疆理圖). Ye Sheng also recorded Yan Jie (嚴節)'s colophon <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> (1452). According to Yan Jie, the Guanglun Jiangli Tu was created in 1360. The extant map was modified, probably by Yan Jie, to catch up with contemporary Ming place names. The original map covered place names of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. Also, Yan Jie's map suggests that the western end of Qingjun's map was around Hotan.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is limited}} to the north with Campos Gerais and Santana da Vargem, on south with the municipality of Varginha, Elói Mendes and Paraguaçu,on east with Nepomuceno e Carmo da Cachoeira and west with Campos Gerais.

According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> of urban hierarchy produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Três Pontas is classified as a B zone center, that means the city has a restricted influence, only over the smaller cities around it. The city is under influence of Varginha that, on the other hand, is under influence of Belo Horizonte.|$|E
