40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of three species of tuna, (<b>Thunnus</b> obesus, T <b>albacares,</b> T alalunga) commonly taken by longline, were studied during scientific cruises in Polynesia, South Pacific. An empirical method was devised for reconstructing the individual weight of prey prior to digestion. It permitted {{the estimation of}} the initial weight of stomach content. Observed values, related to the individual weight of each tuna, appeared low and suggest {{that the vast majority}} of tuna caught by longline had empty or almost empty stomachs. A comparison with observations of tuna caught by the most active gears, such as purse seine or gillnet suggest that only tunas with a low rate of stomach repletion are taken by longline. This suggestion leads to the hypothesis that the catch rate of longline fishing depends not only on tuna density, but also on the relative joint densities of prey and tuna, particularly in biologically heterogeneous environments. The consequences of such a hypothesis on the value of longline CPUE for indexing abundance of deep swimming tuna could be important...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{distribution}} in the oceans is controlled by complex biogeochemical cycles, resulting in retention of trace amounts of this metal in plants and animals. Inter- and intra-specific variations in mercury levels of predatory pelagic fish have been previously linked to size, age, trophic position, physical and chemical environmental parameters, and location of capture; however, considerable variation remains unexplained. In this paper, we focus on differences in ecology, depth of occurrence, and total mercury levels in 9 species of commercially important pelagic fish (<b>Thunnus</b> obesus, T. <b>albacares,</b> Katsuwonus pelamis, Xiphias gladius, Lampris guttatus, Coryphaena hippurus, Taractichthys steindachneri, Tetrapturus audax, and Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) and in numerous representatives (fishes, squids, and crustaceans) of their lower trophic level prey sampled from the central North Pacific Ocean. Results indicate that total mercury levels of predatory pelagic fishes and their prey increase with median depth of occurrence {{in the water column}} and mimic concentrations of dissolved organic mercury in seawater. Stomach content analysis results from this study and others indicate a greater occurrence of higher-mercury containing deeper-water prey organisms in the diets of the deeper-ranging predators, X. gladius, T. obesus, and L. guttatus. While present in trace amounts, dissolved organic mercury increases with depth in the water column suggesting that the mesopelagic habitat is a major entry point for mercury into marine food webs. These data suggest that a major determinant of mercury levels in oceanic predators is their depth of forage...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis provide a {{greater amount of}} DNA sequencing reads at a low cost. Microsatellites are the markers of choice {{for a variety of}} population genetic studies, and high quality markers can be discovered in non-model organisms, such as tuna, with these recent developments. Here, we use a high-throughput method to isolate microsatellite markers in albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga, based on coupling multiplex enrichment and next-generation sequencing on 454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. The crucial minimum number of polymorphic markers to infer evolutionary and ecological processes for this species has been described for the first time. We provide 1670 microsatellite design primer pairs, and technical and molecular genetics selection resulting in 43 polymorphic microsatellite markers. On this panel, we characterized 34 random and selectively neutral markers («neutral») and 9 «non-neutral» markers. The variability of «neutral» markers was screened with 136 individuals of albacore tuna from southwest Indian Ocean (42), northwest Indian Ocean (31), South Africa (31), and southeast Atlantic Ocean (32). Power analysis demonstrated that the panel of genetic markers can be applied in diversity and population genetics studies. Global genetic diversity for albacore was high with a mean number of alleles at 16. 94; observed heterozygosity 66 % and expected heterozygosity 77 %. The number of individuals was insufficient to provide accurate results on differentiation. Of the 9 «non-neutral» markers, 3 were linked to a sequence of known function. The one is located to a sequence having an immunity function (ThuAla-Tcell- 01) and the other to a sequence having energy allocation function (ThuAla-Hki- 01). These two markers were genotyped on the 136 individuals and presented different diversity levels. ThuAla-Tcell- 01 has a high number of alleles (20), heterozygosity (87 - 90 %), and assignment index. ThuAla-Hki- 01 has a lower number of alleles (9), low heterozygosity (24 - 27 %), low assignment index and significant inbreeding. Finally, the 34 «neutral» and 3 «non-neutral» microsatellites markers were tested on four economically important Scombridae species-Thunnus <b>albacares,</b> <b>Thunnus</b> thynnus, Thunnus obesus, and Acanthocybium solandri...|$|R

50|$|Until October 2010, Skipjack (Euthynnus pelamis) and {{yellowfin tuna}} (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares)</b> were fished {{for about two}} {{months of the year}} as their year-long migratory route takes them through Chagos waters. While the {{remoteness}} of the Chagos offers some protection from extractive activities, legal and illegal fishing have had an impact. There is considerable poaching of turtles and other marine life. Sharks, which {{play a vital role in}} balancing the food web of tropical reefs, have suffered sharp declines from illegal fishing for their fins and as bycatch in legal fisheries. Sea cucumbers, which cleanse sand, are poached to feed Asian markets.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the 15 known {{species of}} Photobacterium have evolved into {{pathogens}} of marine life. Some of these diseases affect commercially important fish and can therefore indirectly impact human health through their consumption. This genus {{has been shown}} to degrade the chitin of the Deep Sea Tanner Crab (Chionoecetes tanneri). The species Photobacterium damselae are among the most virulent and are divided into two subspecies: piscicida and damsela. [...] P. damselae subspecies piscicida is the causative agent of fish pasteurellosis. Bacterial colonies grow on the infected fish's spleen and kidney, eventually leading to mortality. This disease accounts for severe losses in some fish farming enterprises {{with some of the most}} susceptible fish including Yellowfin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares),</b> certain Seabreams (Sparus spp.), Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and White perch (Morone americana). This subspecies is not pathogenic for humans.|$|E
5000|$|The Republic of the Marshall Islands has a {{commercial}} fishery that targets bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares)</b> tuna using pelagic longline fishing gear.

30|$|At present, {{a series}} of studies on the ocean {{temperature}} structure have been carried out. The researches on thermocline are meaningful for not only the theoretical study but also the national defense, underwater communications, and fisheries. In terms of fishing, the <b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares</b> {{is one of the major}} targets of the oceanic tuna fishery worldwide, and it moves mostly inside the mixed layer and occasionally below the upper boundary of the thermocline, which is influenced by the temperature gradient greatly [21]. Meanwhile, there are many environmental factors affecting the fishing rate of the <b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares.</b> Romena [22] pointed out that the distribution of adult <b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares</b> was affected by the 20  °C isotherm, and Song [23] analyzed that the vertical distribution of <b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares</b> was related to the thermocline. Concerning the underwater communication and military detection, the underwater acoustic communication is currently the unique means of communication in the ocean, but the acoustic propagation in the water is influenced by changes in temperature, salinity, and density. Therefore, a sudden change in seawater structure in the thermocline area will directly affect the sound transmission, leading to sonar failure [24]. In this condition, the researches on the thermocline are significant to study the distribution of marine fishing grounds and underwater communication detection.|$|E
