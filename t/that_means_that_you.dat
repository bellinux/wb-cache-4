6000|$|... “Asking yourself? <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are really}} asking me. But why {{do it so}} publicly? I mean it. One single, {{detached}} presence {{is enough to make}} a public. One alone. Why not wait till he returns to those regions of space and air—from which he came.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Impertinent! Frank, <b>you</b> said to-night <b>that</b> {{other men}} think what this odious Mr. Pepys says. Yes, you did! Don't deny it! Does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{always think of}} me as [...] "poor wretch"?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You LOVE it," [...] said Miss Patty with emphasis. [...] "Does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really LOVE it? Or <b>that</b> <b>you</b> merely {{like the}} looks of it? The girls {{nowadays}} indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never can tell what they DO mean. It wasn't so in my young days. THEN a girl did not say she LOVED turnips, in just the same tone as she might have said she loved her mother or her Savior." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, as {{you liked}} {{him at first}} well enough to bring him {{straight}} to see me, I suppose <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> now <b>you</b> are immensely pleased with him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a Rodent {{just the}} same. You've got big gnawing teeth, and any one {{with that kind}} of teeth is a Rodent," [...] {{retorted}} Peter. Then at a sudden thought a funny look passed over his face. [...] "Why, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I are related in a way," [...] he added.|$|E
60|$|CONFUCIUS. Not grown-up {{children}}, {{children at}} fifty, sixty, seventy. Your maturity is so late {{that you never}} attain to it. You have to be governed by races which are mature at forty. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are potentially the most highly developed race on earth, and would be actually the greatest if you could {{live long enough to}} attain to maturity.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Only I dread {{to think}} of {{anything}} beyond the present. What is, we know. We are together now, and it is unknown how long we shall be so; the unknown always fills my mind with terrible possibilities, even when I may reasonably {{expect it to be}} cheerful... Clym, the eclipsed moonlight shines upon your face with a strange foreign colour, and shows its shape as if it were cut out in gold. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be doing better things than this." ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{overseas}} branches {{are only}} affiliated with Bank of China branches in China. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> deposit {{money in a}} China branch, you cannot access your money in overseas branches.|$|R
2500|$|You and Senator Kerry {{have said}} that the war in Iraq is the wrong war at the wrong time. Does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> had been {{president}} and vice president that Saddam Hussein would still be in power? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} were, {{and that was}} the disobedience; for when I command you to keep in sight of me, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must take good care that you do mind where you are. Suppose I were to tell Jonas that he might go and take a walk, but that he must be sure to come back in half an hour, and he should go, and pay no {{attention}} to the time, and so not come back until three quarters of an hour; would that be obedience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hardly know}} what to write to you, my dear Father, about this new symptom of illness. I suppose, from what you say, that at your time of life the disease being so mild in its form now, will hardly prove {{dangerous}} to you, especially as you submit at once to a strictness of diet which must be pretty hard to follow out--just the habit of a whole life to be given up; and I know that to forego anything that I like, in matters of eating and drinking, wants an effort that I feel ashamed of being obliged to make. I don't, therefore, make myself unnecessarily anxious, though I can't help feeling that such a discipline must be hard. You say that in other respects you are much the same; but <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are in almost constant pain, and that you cannot obtain entire relief from it, except in bed.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR PLAYMATE,--You said on our tramp that I {{would make}} a [...] good playmate, but I'm sure that I should be a very poor one [...] if I did not wish you a gloriously merry Xmas & a New Year [...] that will bring you all the dear things you want.

6000|$|DICK. But, Joy, dear, don't you see--if your Mother knows a {{thing like}} that, and does n't speak of it, it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> she--it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't make her hate him--it means----If it were anybody else-- but, well, you can't give your own Mother away! ...|$|R

Digger the Badger is just as much a cousin of yours as is Shadow the Weasel. You {{are members of the}} same order and it is a rather large order. It is called the Car-niv-o-ra, which means 'flesh-eating.' You are a member of the Marten or Weasel family, and that family is called the 'Mus-tel-i-dae.' Digger the Badger {{is also a member of}} that family. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> two are cousins. You and Digger and Glutton the Wolverine belong to the stout-bodied branch of the family. Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Shadow the Weasel, Pekan the Fisher and Spite the Marten belong to its slim-bodied branch. But all are members of the same family despite the {{difference}} in looks, and thus, of course, are cousins. Seeing that you are here, Jimmy, I think we will find out just how much these little folks know about you.|$|E

The Nachos kernel instead is compiled to the platform of the Host OS and thus runs natively on the Host OS' CPU.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{advice to}} young singers is: [...] "To strive for excellence, that's the answer. If you strive for excellence, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are determined.

5000|$|Despite these {{supportive}} stances, the anarchist {{movement of}} the time certainly wasn't free of homophobia: an editorial in an influential Spanish anarchist journal from 1935 argued that an Anarchist shouldn't even associate with homosexuals, let alone be one: [...] "If you are an anarchist, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are more morally upright and physically strong than the average man. And he who likes inverts is no real man, and is therefore no real anarchist." ...|$|E

[...] "Your {{retention of}} <b>that</b> document <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> take {{sides in the}} civil war which seems hanging over my country.

5000|$|Seth Mnookin, {{author of}} The Panic Virus, also partly blames {{the media for}} {{presenting}} a false balance between scientific evidence and people's personal experiences: [...] "Reporting fell into this 'on the one hand, on the other hand' fallacy, this notion {{that if you have}} two sides that are disagreeing, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should present both of them with equal weight."

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} {{option is}} the weighted [...] The {{advantage of this}} measure is that could weight errors, so you can define how to weight for your relevant business, ex gross profit or ABC. The {{only problem is that}} for seasonal products you will create an undefined result when sales = 0 and that is not symmetrical, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can be much more inaccurate if sales are higher than if they are lower than the forecast.

40|$|Speakers: Tom Peters and Lori Bell Broadcast Date: April 11, 2008 In {{surveying}} {{the landscape of}} our profession and the technological trends that impact it, it is simple to identify several new technologies that “could” be used by libraries to improve or enhance the patrons’ experience with and perception of the Library. This program will investigate new trends in libraries such as patron-created folksonomic cataloging (del. cio. us, LibraryThing 2 ̆ 6 {{the new breed of}} OPAC’s), libraries and librarians in virtual environments such as Second Life, as well as give an update on libraries and social networks (mySpace 2 ̆ 6 facebook). Are these trends? Just fads? Plain old Folly? We’ll deal with a central question in this teleconference: To what extent do Libraries need to quickly adopt new technologies into their programs? Or, “just because you can do it, does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should?” This teleconference is 90 minutes in length [...] Noon to 1 : 30 p. m. Eastern Time...|$|R

If <b>you</b> ask <b>that,</b> it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know nothing {{of the life of}} the Maritime Provinces and the sturdy temper of the people.

3000|$|Two {{patients}} {{and a single}} clinician—but no administrators—defined culturally competent care as fighting stigma. One patient with bipolar depression exemplified these responses of cultural competence as “more education on mental illness {{so that people can}} understand <b>that</b> because <b>you</b> have a mental illness, <b>that</b> doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a crazy person, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to be hospitalized for life.” A patient with a different disorder said that cultural competence is “enlightening people on mental issues so that people don’t stigmatize.” [...]...|$|R
