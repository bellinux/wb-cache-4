25|$|<b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> {{petitions}} {{asking the}} courts for freedom has been a practice within North America {{dating back to the}} late 1600s. Some of the first petitions for freedom were not directed at the courts, but to the various colonial joint stock companies, such as the Dutch West India Company, which operated in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic area. During the early importation of enslaved laborers, the West India Company had no strict laws governing their status and condition. Enslaved persons were allowed to marry and raise families as long as they continued to work for the company. In this regard, many early petitions were by slaves attempting to obtain freedom on behalf of their nuclear families. In the antebellum period, women slaves were instrumental in seeking freedom to protect their children.|$|E

500|$|While most of {{the early}} reviewers of the Rights of Men, {{as well as most}} of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and {{juxtaposed}} it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, {{have come to the conclusion}} that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable. Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. It is not until after the halfway point of Rights of Men that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, [...] "it seems that in <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career." ...|$|E
500|$|Luis {{uses the}} term [...] "onomastic displacement" [...] with {{reference}} to the multiple nicknames that fragment Yolanda's concept of a whole and unified self. This continuous onomastic displacement incites in Yolanda the desire to question her divided identity, to seek unity, clarity and a coherent understanding of her circumstances. Yolanda achieves this clarity through <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and even as a young girl she revels in the completion of her speech for the Teacher's Day address because [...] "she finally sound like herself in English!" [...] Unlike her sister Sandi, [...] "whose artistic predilections were crushed as a child, Yolanda faces and works through her identity problems in her writing". [...] Barak views Yolanda's writing as a process {{that can be used to}} reunite the fragments of her identity; as an aid in the acceptance of [...] "her own 'hybrid' nature... bringing both her worlds and all her selves into balance". It is thus only through writing, the expression of Yolanda's most intricately personal thoughts and revelations, that the protagonist can retain the hope of restoring her unified personal identity.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{contend that}} Gibson's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream.

His influence on early pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged, and he holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design. Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the [...] "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking [...] "what if <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> it down, in fact, brought it about?" ...|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare's early {{classical}} and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give {{way in the}} mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes. Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing, the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies. After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives—which introduced {{a new kind of}} drama. According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar, [...] "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> began to infuse each other".|$|E

40|$|Wandering Shards' is a {{performed}} {{reading with}} film projection. The {{context of the}} work is the foreshore at Greenwich where the River Thames is framed by the historical monuments to Britain’s past maritime power on one bank and the current financial district of Canary Wharf on the other. Here, the river continually throws up osteo artefacts, the ‘waste’ remainder of industries which once lined the southern shore. ‘Wandering Shards’ explores the uncanny pull of these objects not through a drive to archive or establish a fixed osteo-archaeological identification, but rather to consider their attraction as transformational objects that conjoin with the dynamics of the river and our own organic past and present. The presentation further suggests that through <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> speaking and visual imaging, overlooked ‘remains’ can be considered to generate imaginative and material renewal, a practice of ‘bringing to life’ which is inherently contingent...|$|R
40|$|The {{three main}} {{objectives}} of the research project ‘No Problem Has Solution: A Digital Archive of the Book of Disquiet’ 1 are: (1) to represent <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and editing {{in the production of}} the LdoD 2; (2) to explore the potential of the digital medium to simulate the history of this dynamics; and (3) to create a space for virtualizing the LdoD capable of fostering new dynamics of reading, editing, and researching in the encounter between readers and its ma-terial corpus <b>of</b> <b>written</b> fragments. This article describes the project’s rationale and proposes a conceptual model of the functions that the software application to be developed should be able to perform. In this model, the electronic encoding of the fragments should support radial configurations that respond to multiple interactions. This model of the dynamic and reconfigurative iterability of the archive will enable users to virtualize the book according to four functions: reader-function, editor-function, book-function, and author-function. ...|$|R
2500|$|Moreover, {{because of}} the novel's strict {{adherence}} to history, critic Greg Harris describes the novel pushing the boundaries between historical fiction and non-fiction. In her study of the novel, Karin Westman describes <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> historical fiction as [...] "a challenge" [...] for Barker. Westman notes that Barker, at times, made deliberate choices not to preserve realism, when, for example, she omits the kinds of language and humour used by soldiers during the period. In some interviews, Barker directly challenges the characterisation of the novel as an [...] "historical novel," [...] suggesting that the First World War stands in for other wars and allows her to represent more unspecific war-related themes.|$|E
2500|$|Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) take {{exception}} {{to the role of}} [...] "hot lesbian" [...] in advertisements, and what has turned lesbianism into a commodity. As Diamond (2005) states, [...] "media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand this is not necessarily the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality" [...] (p.105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of {{what it is to be}} lesbian, thus making it much harder for real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, [...] "In order to resist this we must first recognize the ubiquitous presence of [...] "fad" [...] lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities" [...] (p.113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be sure of what media means to them, and call into question things that do not appear [...] "authentic". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the [...] "hot lesbian", and ensure they do not fall into the [...] "heteronormative appropriation" [...] of advertising's effects.|$|E
2500|$|Among the new {{intellectual}} currents influencing Koreans during Japanese rule, {{a version}} of Social Darwinism promulgated by the Chinese historian Liang Qichao was influential among nationalist journalist-historians like Shin Chaeho, Choe Nam-seon, and Park Eun-sik. Liang taught {{that the world was}} divided between peoples who were expansionist and influential, such as the Anglo-Saxons and Germans, and those peoples who were weak and insignificant. The themes of struggle for existence (saengjŏn kyŏngjaeng), survival of the fittest (yangyuk kangsik) and natural selection (ch'ŏntaek) inspired not only Shin's own historical views, but also those the Korean [...] "self-strengthening movement" [...] (chagang undong), which operated in similar terms to that in China and in Japan. Shin was also influenced by Liang's [...] "Methods for the Study of Chinese History" [...] (Zhongguo lishi yangjiufa, 1922), from which many of Shin's methods derive. He wrote his own history of Korea which broke from Confucian tradition, whose purveyors he decried as [...] "effete" [...] and disconnected from Korea's [...] "manly" [...] tradition going back to the ancient [...] "Korean" [...] expansionist kingdom of Goguryeo. Shin felt that Confucian historiography, and especially that of Kim Bu-sik and his alleged pro-Silla bias, suppressed a valid Korean claim to Manchurian territory, which not only had Goguryeo possessed, but Shin conceived as a central stage of Korean history, and a measure of the minjoks strength. Moreover, it was <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> history that caused Koreans not to rise up and conquer Manchuria again, according to Shin, resulting in a [...] "great country becoming a small country, a great people becoming a small people". Yet he also criticized the shin sach'e textbooks after the Confucians, who nonetheless treated Japan sympathetically, translated Japanese historical works, and reflected the Japanese worldview. He also criticized Pan-Asianism as a guise for Japanese expansionism and regarded East Asia as a mere geographic unit, rather than a basis for solidarity. As a result, his new history focused on [...] both [...] "national struggle" [...] rather than on {{the rise and fall of}} political dynasties, and emphasizing Korea's separateness from China and Japan, as he argued that historiography [...] "should promote national spirit and independence". The fellow historians Park Eun-sik (1859–1925) and Chang Chi-yŏng likewise attempted to rectify the [...] "slave literary culture" [...] (noyejŏk munhwa sasang) of the yangban to reflect historical Korea's supposed martial tradition.|$|E
