40|$|The use of {{the four}} new {{synthesized}} polyurethane acrylate binders in the pigment print paste for screen printing cotton and polyester fabrics and pigment fixation through the polymerization process of the binder by using the <b>thermofixation</b> technique {{as well as the}} UV curing technique was studied. The effect of changing time and temperature of <b>thermofixation,</b> and the time of UV curing on the color strength, and prints fastness properties were also studied. The results showed that, the newly synthesized polyurethane acrylate binders could be successfully used for pigment fixation on cotton and polyester using the two fixation techniques and in general their prints possessed better color strength values as compared to those obtained upon using the selected commercial binders...|$|E
40|$|Polylactic acid {{also named}} {{polylactide}} (PLA) is a biodegradable fiber synthesized from renewable natural plant sugars. Widely used in biomedical applications, PLA fibers can be dyed with standard polyester dyes and dyeing procedures. Some {{of the common}} dyeing methods include high temperature (HT) dyeing, rapidly dyeing in HT, <b>thermofixation,</b> dyeing with carrier, solvent-assisted dyeing and solvent dyeing. Regardless of the dyeing method, the key to achieving better dye uptake is the selection of appropriate dyeing conditions. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|The iodine {{sorption}} allows {{to study}} the variation of the free volume of polyester fibres submitted to dry heat treatments or to hat treatments {{in the presence of}} water and/or solvents that are frequently used in the textile industry or control laboratories. From the iodine sorption curve {{as a function of the}} <b>thermofixation</b> temperature, it is inferred that the sorption at 65 Â°C alloys to detect structure differences induced by variations of the <b>thermofixation</b> temperatures of the wool/polyester articles; nevertheless, the sensitivity of the method is perhaps not sufficient to detect this same type of differences in the cellulosic-polyester articles. On the other hand, it is possible to use the iodine sorption at 500 C as a control method of the variation of the structure and, consequently of the dyeing behaviour of articles having undergone the texturizing operation. Besides the study has related the produced effect in the fibre structure by dyeing treatments with and without carrier, or by treatments using solvents as perchlorethylene, dioxane, and methylene chloriae. The perchlorethylene sets the fibre structure as well as the carriers that were used. On the other hand, treatments with dioxane and methylene chloride product an increasing of rate of weak crystalline order...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeCyclodextrins (CDs) are torus shaped cyclic {{oligosaccharides}} with a hydrophobic internal {{cavity and}} a hydrophilic external surface. We performed and analysed an antibiotic binding on Dacron (polyethyleneterephtalate, PET) vascular grafts, previously coated with CDs based polymers. MethodsThe CDs coating process {{was based on}} the pad-dry-cure method patented in our laboratory. The Dacron prostheses were immersed into a solution containing a polycarboxylic acid, a cyclodextrin and a catalyst, and placed into a <b>thermofixation</b> oven before impregnation with an antibiotic solution (Vancomycin). Biocompatibility tests were performed with L 132 human epithelial cells. The antibiotic release in an aqueous medium was assessed by batch type experiments using UV spectroscopy. ResultsViability tests confirmed that the CDs polymers coating the Dacron fibers were not toxic towards L 132 cell. Cell proliferation was similar on coated and uncoated grafts. A linear release of Vancomycin was observed over 50 days. ConclusionOur results demonstrate the feasibility of coating CDs onto vascular Dacron grafts. Biological tests show no toxicity of the different cyclodextrins coated. A linear release of antibiotics was depicted over 50 days, demonstrating that cyclodextrin grafting was an efficient drug delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Finishing using TiO 2 -nanosol {{treatment}} {{of cellulose acetate}} (CA) fabrics {{before and after the}} latter were pretreated with H 2 O 2 was undertaken with a view to impart unique properties to CA fabrics, notably, self-cleaning. Finishing was performed as per the pad-dry-cure method. The finishing treatment involved dispersing the nano-sized TiO 2 particles in a mixture of water and ethylene glycol (1 : 1) and application of the dispersions to CA fabrics was made under a variety of conditions. Self cleaning ability of the fabrics is favored by 1) increasing the concentration of TiO 2 -nanosol to certain limit; 2) prolongation of curing time up to 15 second; 3) raising the microwave power from 80 % to 100 % but with the certainty that power of 90 % is the most proper. Besides, exposure time-to UV radiation-up to 90 minutes is essential to have remarkable self cleaning properties while keeping other technical properties, namely, strength, roughness and wettability practically unaltered. Incorporation of binder in the finishing pad-bath helps stabilizing the deposition of TiO 2 with excellent self-cleaning. Pre{{treatment of}} CA fabrics with H 2 O 2 is a pre requisite to guarantee excellent self-cleaning ability. <b>Thermofixation</b> and microwave fixation produces fabrics with very comparable technical properties...|$|E
40|$|ISPERSE dyes are nonionic, have D {{very limited}} {{solubility}} in water at room temperature and have substantivity for one or more hydrophobic fibers; e. g., polyesters and nylons. They are usually applied from a fine aqueous dispersion containing some dissolved dye. This definition changes the emphasis of that given in the Colour Index (I) to stress the most important fibers and to {{reflect the fact that}} it is the aqueous solution from which dyeing normally takes place, despite the 'low water solubility of the dye. Solutions are characterized by the presence of the solute (dye) as single molecules; i. e., in a monomolecular form. Even in <b>thermofixation</b> and heat transfer printing (Z), where dyeing takes place in the absence of water, the dyes must first sublime into single molecules (dissolve) in air before diffusion into the fiber can take place. The AATCC Buyer's Guide (3) lists over 700 disperse dye products under more than 200 Colour Index names. The majority of these are blues, ca. 30 %; reds, ca. 25 % and yellows, ca. 20 %. Oranges and violets both account for ca. 8 % and browns account for ca. 3 %. This leaves little room The fiber, dye and dyebath variables which affect the batch dyeing of polyester with disperse dyes are discussed, as are some of the chemical properties of disperse dyes which influence the normal conditions of dye application, stripping and reduction clearing. Discussion of the continuous dyeing of polyester is deferred to a iater chapter on dyeing polyester/cellulosic fiber blends...|$|E
