25|$|Alliance {{undertook}} a hostile takeover effort, suing {{to block the}} WMS merger, announcing a <b>tender</b> <b>offer</b> of up to $55 million for 4.4 million shares of Bally, enough {{to give it a}} controlling interest, and seeking consent from Bally's shareholders to replace a majority of the board. Bally and WMS fired back with separate lawsuits seeking to block Alliance's <b>tender</b> <b>offer.</b> Alliance raised its offer to $70 million for 5.4 million shares, and WMS in turn raised its total bid to $142 million. In October, Alliance announced that it had been tendered 5.8 million shares, and alleged that Bally and WMS had reached an impasse over Bally's failure to find a buyer for Bally Wulff. The next day, Bally's board capitulated, canceling the deal with WMS and approving a merger with Alliance on terms {{similar to those of the}} <b>tender</b> <b>offer,</b> with a total value of $215 million.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} wealth effects of European cash <b>tender</b> <b>offers</b> for bonds {{during the period}} from 1996 to 2005. European bond offers are made to refinance (35 % of cases), to reduce debt (40 %) or {{triggered}} by an ownership change (25 %). We investigate the wealth effects to both bondholders and shareholders. Cash <b>tender</b> <b>offers</b> for bonds turn out to be value creating for firms; with bondholders taking most of the gains on a relative basis. We find no evidence of wealth transfers from shareholders to bondholders: bondholders are paid an average tender premium of 3. 9 % but shareholders do not experience a significant wealth loss. Shareholders even benefit from making refinancing bond <b>tender</b> <b>offers</b> after a drop in interest rates. The wealth effects to both bondholders and shareholders increase in the remaining time to maturity.

This research provides direct empirical evidence on the relationship between managerial welfare and takeover bid resistance.

However, by late 1962, the initial sales gains evaporated {{and the six}} outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963, the stock was trading in the $30s. Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971, the board turned to William J. Kane, who joined A in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations, including cleanliness, product availability, customer service, and courtesy. When his program stalled, Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem was that most A were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973, the stock dropped to $17, and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a <b>tender</b> <b>offer</b> at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer, although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A's continuing difficulties.
