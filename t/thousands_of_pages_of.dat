Almost all of the film's script was drawn from <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> documentation.

Ron Howard had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood.

5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> {{evidence}} gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent {{assigned to the}} case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On {{their way to the}} finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian left-wing {{became a}} major {{priority}} for intelligence services in the RCMP during the period between the two world wars, particularity focusing on the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). As {{the likelihood of a}} second world war increased in 1938, some attention shifted to fascist movements in Canada. In these years, at divisions and in the field, the number of persons involved in intelligence work varied enormously. This number did not usually exceed 10 to 20 officers in major cities and most work was done on a part-time basis. Likewise, the full-time Ottawa intelligence staff never exceeded {{more than a handful of}} personnel in the inter-war period. However, the efforts of Ottawa and out-lying divisions produced hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> material in the period alone.|$|E
25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although everyone {{knew that there were}} spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} Trevor-Roper gave {{his opinion of}} authenticity, Rupert Murdoch and his {{negotiation}} team arrived in Zürich. A deal was provisionally agreed for $2.5million for the US serialisation rights, with an additional $750,000 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the discussions between Murdoch and Sorge were taking place, the diaries were examined by Broyle and his Newsweek team. After lengthy negotiation Broyle was informed that the minimum price Stern would consider was $3million; the Americans returned home, informing Hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days. When Broyle contacted the Germans he offered the amount, subject to authentication by their chosen expert, Gerhard Weinberg. In 1952 Weinberg, a cautious and careful historian, had written the Guide to Captured German Documents, {{for use by the}} US military; the work is described by Hamilton as definitive in its scope of the subject. Weinberg travelled to Zürich and, like Trevor-Roper, was impressed and reassured by the range of items on show; he was also partly persuaded by Trevor-Roper's endorsement of the diaries' authenticity. Weinberg commented that [...] "the notion of anyone forging hundreds, even <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> handwriting was hard to credit".|$|E
500|$|Aldrich Ames, a CIA counterintelligence agent {{working in}} the SE Division, {{approached}} the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. on April 16, 1985, and within a month received $50,000 from the KGB in exchange for espionage service. Meeting with Soviet official and go-between Sergey Dmitriyevich Chuvakhin on June 13, Ames passed him copied documents identifying over ten Soviet agents working for the CIA and FBI. As a CIA review related, [...] the Soviets began arresting and sometimes executing U.S. operatives later in 1985, and the CIA realized that it [...] "was faced with a major CI problem." [...] Suspicions initially fell on Edward Lee Howard, a former CIA officer who also compromised CIA operations in 1985 and defected to the Soviet Union on September 21. However, the CIA realized by Fall 1985 that Howard was not responsible {{for all of the}} damage. Three agents arrested in Fall 1985 and later executed, some of the CIA's most valuable sources, had been betrayed by Ames, not Howard. By December, six SE agents had vanished, a trend which continued into 1986; according to a congressional report, the over 20 operations Ames revealed [...] "amounted to a virtual collapse of the CIA's Soviet operations." [...] Ames, who stated that he spied for the KGB due to his financial debt, gave <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> classified documents to the Soviets and later admitted to disclosing over 100 CIA, FBI, military, and allied operations; he was deemed responsible for the arrests and executions of ten U.S. sources.|$|E
500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E
