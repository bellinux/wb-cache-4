40|$|Although agency theory {{suggests}} that firms ought to index executive compensation to remove market-wide effects (i. e., RPE), {{there is little evidence}} to support this theory. Oyer (2004) posits that absence of RPE is optimal if <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> reservation wages from outside employment opportunities rise and fall with the economy's fortunes. We directly test and find support for Oyer's (2004) theory. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> outside opportunities depend on his talent proxied by <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> financial press visibility and his firm's recent industry-adjusted ROA. Our results are robust to alternate explanations such as managerial skimming, oligopoly and asymmetric benchmarking...|$|R

40|$|To empirically {{test the}} impact of CEOs' outside wealth on their compensation, I use spousal divorce {{as a proxy for}} an exogenous, {{negative}} shock to a CEO's outside wealth. I hypothesize that this shock decreases a CEO's risk tolerance. I also expect that the board of directors responds to this decrease by raising <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> cash compensation and by increasing the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> compensation to changes in firm value. I find that cash bonuses, restricted stock grants, and option grants increase following a CEO's divorce, consistent with boards reacting to changes in CEOs' outside wealth and risk incentives. I also find that firms' total risk and idiosyncratic risk significantly drop during the year of a CEO's divorce, consistent with a drop in <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> risk tolerance. Overconfident CEOs, who are more risk tolerant, do not receive the same increases in compensation following divorce. I find little support for the relation between divorce and compensation being endogenously determined by performance or by poor corporate governance. Overall, the results support predictions that the board of directors takes <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> wealth into account when setting compensation and that outside wealth impacts <b>the</b> <b>CEO's</b> risk preferences...|$|R
