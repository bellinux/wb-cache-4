Comparisons are made of the dynamic behaviour of non-irradiated and irradiated materials previously subjected to creep, low cycle fatigue and irradiation (2, 10 and 30 displacements per atom). In particular, complete results of the effect of irradiation on the dynamic mechanical properties of AISI 304 L steel, tested at 20, 400 and 550 ◦C are presented. These high strain rate tests have been performed with a modified Hopkinson bar (MHB), installed inside a hot cell. Examples of testing large nuclear steel specimens with a very large Hopkinson bar are also shown. The results overall demonstrate the capability of <b>the</b> MHB <b>to</b> efficiently <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> stress conditions in case of accidental internal and external dynamic loadings in nuclear reactors, thus contributing to the important process of their structural assessment.

Dis-regulation of cell division through checkpoint malfunction can lead to developmental defects and contribute to the development or progression of tumors. This review approaches two important mitotic checkpoints, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The highly conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) controls the onset of anaphase by preventing premature segregation of the sister chromatids of the duplicated genome, to the spindle poles. In contrast, the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC), in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, ensures that during asymmetric cell division mitotic exit does not occur until the spindle is properly aligned with the cell polarity axis. Although there are no known homologs, there is indication that functionally similar checkpoints exist also in animal cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of growing safety-related {{requirements}} in shipbuilding the design of double hulls in respect to accidents and collisions is mainly orientated on damage stability calculations. In order to increase the collision resistance and thereby the damage stability of ships {{the concept of an}} alternative stiffening system (English: plates strengthened stiffeners, German: Plattenverstärkte Profilsteifen – PVPS) invented by Röhr et al. (2008) was investigated for practical use within the scope of the project SideColl, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). A collision experiment with a scaled double hull structure is performed with the alternative stiffening system. Beside the experimental investigations numerical simulations with the finite element software LS-Dyna are conducted. With the adaption of suitable discretizations and fracture criteria in the finite element model the structural response in terms of the force-displacement curve are well predicted. Furthermore, the crack initiation and the failure mechanism are captured in good agreement with the experiment. An equivalent model for weld joints is applied to the double hull structure <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> different <b>material</b> behavior at plastic deformations and fracture in the numerical analysis...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{machining}} {{has been}} exploited {{as a means for}} producing ultra-fine grained (UFG) and nanocrystalline microstructures for various metal materials, such as aluminum alloys, copper, stainless steel, titanium and nickel-based super alloys, etc. However, no predictive, analytical or numerical work has ever been presented to quantitatively predict the change of grain sizes during machining. In this paper, a dislocation density-based viscoplastic model is adapted for modeling the grain size refinement mechanism during machining by means of a finite element based numerical framework. A novel Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) finite element model embedded with the dislocation density subroutine is developed to model the severe plastic deformation and grain refinement during a steady-state cutting process. The orthogonal cutting tests of a commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) material are simulated in order to assess the validity of the numerical solution through comparison with experiments. <b>The</b> dislocation density-based <b>material</b> model is calibrated <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> observed <b>material</b> constitutive mechanical behavior of CP Ti under various strains, strain rates and temperatures in the cutting process.
