5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a review}} of our {{guidelines}} for the longest dreadlock, we have taken expert advice and {{made the decision to}} rest this category. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is difficult, and in many cases impossible, to measure the authenticity of the locks due to expert methods employed in the attachment of hair extensions/re-attachment of broken off dreadlocks. Effectively the dreadlock can become an extension and therefore impossible to adjudicate accurately. It is for this reason Guinness World Records has decided to rest the category and will no longer be monitoring the category for longest dreadlock.|$|E
25|$|Any {{branch of}} an {{organization}} that is part {{of an organization}} banned by the central government of the PRC under state security reasons can be banned in Hong Kong at any time, and the Hong Kong government does not have to conduct any independent investigation. This provision was of particular concern because Mainland China does not have a general legal mechanism for defining a banned organization or political dissidents. One consequence of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> becomes somewhat harder to prosecute regular members of an organization disliked by the PRC, as it requires the central government {{to try to find a}} crime which the individual has committed.|$|E

The possible route for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> leaves the trackbed just north of Stourbridge Town and runs past Stourbridge Interchange, travelling along Foster Street before crossing St John's Road and running onto High Street with a stop opposite the Ryemarket Square. Then travelling further down High Street for a terminus at the public space in between High Street and Lower Street. Press reports in August 2010 marked the milestone of half a million passengers having been passed, and indicate substantial growth rates and reliability levels comparable to the Docklands Light Railway; a new depot could consolidate this early success.|$|E
25|$|Masks in Mexico {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of dance, ceremony, festivals and theatre, with their wearing not {{separate}} from the event in which they are used. The most common uses are with traditional dances, which are a form of theater, with characters, storyline and music, but the performers are not professionals. The purpose of the masks it convert participants into other beings or characters. This element is so important in many events that if a dancer does not use a mask, he often wears dark glasses to indicate that he is not his normal self. A double sense of masking is to use dark glasses over a mask. With few exceptions, dances are performed by males, who play female roles wearing masks. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not considered proper for women in Europe to act or dance, a prohibition brought to Mexico by the Spanish. One important character of this type is La Malinche, in dances about the Conquest.|$|E
25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E

25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} of athletics stadiums in England is very poor compared to most other developed countries. The {{main reason for}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the UK since the Second World War, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. The largest existing stadium is the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. London's largest athletics venue is Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. It will be superseded by the Olympic Stadium, which will be built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but {{will most likely be}} reduced to 60,000 seats after the Games with the London organising committee's decision to accept West Ham United's bid to take over the stadium. There are two Athletic stadiums in Birmingham the Alexander Stadium (12,700 capacity) which is home to UK Athletics and there is also the National Indoor Arena (14,150) which is also used for other events.|$|E

500|$|Territorial {{disputes}} between Chile, Peru and Bolivia triggered the War of the Pacific in 1879 with Chile invading and occupying Peruvian and Bolivian land. [...] In {{the course of}} the war, North suffered damage to his waterworks, and one of his ships was sunk. [...] However he also befriended the Chilean Admiral Patricio Lynch who later supported him in his business ventures. [...] During the war, North was assisted by two British men: Robert Harvey, who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates (saltpetre) industry, and John Dawson, a banker. [...] North was able to use Harvey's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru's poor military performance during the war. [...] After the war, the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields, perhaps influenced by appeals from North's friends. [...] North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds. [...] The reason that the Chilean government allowed <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would have cost them GBP£4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators. [...] By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates.|$|E

De Mortillet emphasised the importance of the presence or absence of the cortex around the edge in the 19th century: [...] "Even on some of the best worked pieces it is common to see, sometimes on the base but more often on the side, a small area that has not been worked, that is uncut. It could be thought that this is a mistake or an error. But often the most probable reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was intentional.
