You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Roxas' {{personality}} changes significantly {{across the}} series due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> first introduced, he appears with fake memories {{that make him}} believe he is a common teenager, and {{spends most of his}} time with his friends. After learning that he is Sora's Nobody, and remembering his past, Roxas gives up his existence so that Sora can continue to exist, but still expresses happiness for his fate. During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no memories of a previous life, unlike other Nobodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E

5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further complicated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|Deliberate, {{productive}} {{struggle with}} mathematical ideas refers to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, {{even if this}} struggle initially involves confusion and errors, {{the end result is}} greater learning. This {{has been shown to be}} true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.|$|E

On 10 February 1807 she sailed to Rio Grande with an army commissary officer aboard to procure provisions from the Portuguese. While Rollo was at Montevideo she suffered from desertions.

25|$|The primary defect {{associated}} with iminoglycinuria is a homozygous (recessive) mutation of the SLC36A2 (PAT2) gene. One of several membrane transport proteins in the {{solute carrier family}} of amino acid transporters, PAT2 is the high-affinity renal transporter of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline found to be defective in both alleles when iminoglycinuria is present in an individual. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> only one PAT2 allele is defective, hyperglycinuria will be present instead of iminoglycinuria. These findings delineate iminoglycinuria as the homozygous form of hyperglycinuria, with the former having a higher degree of urinary excretion of glycine and imino acids correlating to mutations in both alleles.|$|E
25|$|A vector may be {{described}} as a list of numbers in terms of a basis, but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless of how one chooses to describe it in a basis. This persistence of identity is reflected in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a vector is written in one basis, and then the basis is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a change of basis formula. Such a transformation law is known as a covariant transformation. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, {{in the same way as}} a basis does: the covariant derivative must change by a covariant transformation (hence the name).|$|E
60|$|That the cat did {{not turn}} and rend Tarzan is {{something}} of a miracle which may possibly be accounted for by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> twice <b>when</b> it turned growling upon the ape-man he had rapped it sharply upon its sensitive nose, inculcating in its mind thereby a most wholesome fear of the cudgel and the ape-beasts behind it.|$|R

60|$|Now <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> was <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Solomon {{jumped into}} the bramble-bush {{he was wearing his}} spectacles, and the brambles pushed the glasses so close against his eyes that he could not open them; and so, as every other part of him was {{scratched}} and bleeding, and he could not open his eyes, he made sure they were scratched out.|$|R
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference lies in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{a retired}} Air Force officer, Major Wesley T. Carter, filed a {{complaint}} with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the Air Force Reserve at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.|$|E
25|$|A horreum (plural: horrea) was a type {{of public}} {{warehouse}} used during the ancient Roman period. Although the Latin term {{is often used to}} refer to granaries, Roman horrea were used to store many other types of consumables; the giant Horrea Galbae in Rome were used not only to store grain but also olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing and even marble. By the end of the imperial period, the city of Rome had nearly 300 horrea to supply its demands. The biggest were enormous, even by modern standards; the Horrea Galbae contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m²). The amount of storage space available in the public horrea can be judged by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the emperor Septimius Severus died in 211 AD, he is said to have left the city's horrea stocked with enough food to supply Rome's million-strong population for seven years. Smaller (though similar) horrea were a standard feature of Roman towns, cities and forts throughout the empire; well-preserved examples of military horrea have been excavated on Hadrian's Wall in England, notably at the forts of Housesteads, Corbridge and South Shields.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} how narrators from Brazilian Amazon region configurate oral tradition {{in two different}} ways. The first way, called “folk-tale” is characterized considering <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> narrators, <b>when</b> telling their stories, privilege the dimensions of repetition and stability. The second one, called “oral story”, ischaracterized considering <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> narrators, <b>when</b> telling their stories, privilege the dimensions of difference and instability. The present analysis of both configurations takes into account two aspects (i) the enunciative situation {{in which they were}} produced and (ii) the textual and discursive strategies developed by narrators. Folk-tales present (i) fixed plots, which are common-shared and (ii) referenciation strategies that do not show the discursive instances in which the stories are produced. Oral stories reconstruct tradition radically. In this way, they do not present fixed plots, what makes possible the emergency of versions that are distant from the formulaic nature of oral tradition. Referenciation strategies present in this second narrative configuration are much more varied and they also make possible the emergency of the discursive instances in which narratives are produced...|$|R

500|$|Hemodynamic {{techniques}} {{take advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{an area of the}} brain works at a task, blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen (in {{what is known as the}} Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent, or BOLD, response). [...] Such techniques include PET and fMRI. [...] These techniques provide high spatial resolution, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain; temporal resolution (or information about the timing of brain activity), on the other hand, is poor, since the BOLD response happens much more slowly than language processing. [...] In addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations, hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time, as a function of linguistic exposure.|$|E

Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her.

[...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{that an important}} function of leptin is to confine the storage of triglycerides (TG) to the adipocytes, while limiting TG storage in nonadipocytes, thus protecting them from lipotoxicity. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> TG content in nonadipocytes normally remains within a narrow range, while that of adipocytes varies enormously with food intake, {{is consistent with a}} system of TG homeostasis in normal nonadipocytes. <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> leptin receptors are dysfunctional, TG content in nonadipocytes such as islets can increase 100 -fold, and that constitutively expressed ectopic hyperleptinemia depletes TG, suggest that leptin controls the homeostatic system for intracellular TG. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> function and viability of nonadipocytes is compromised when their TG content rises above or falls below the normal range suggests that normal homeostasis of their intracellular TG is critical for optimal function and to prevent lipoapoptosis. Thus far, lipotoxic diabetes of fa/fa Zucker diabetic fatty rats is the only proven lipodegenerative disease, but the possibility of lipotoxic disease of skeletal and/or cardiac muscle may require investigation, as does the possible influence of the intracellular TG content on autoimmune and neoplastic processes...|$|R

On 29 October 1889, nearly {{a year to the}} day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.|$|E

The show displayed a 1936 treatment of Lucille Lloyd's [...] "California Allegory" [...] triptych, with Queen Califia as the central figure. Templeton said that [...] "Califia {{is a part of}} California history, and she also reinforces <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Cortes named this place California, he had 300 black people with him." [...] Templeton pointed out that Columbus had a black navigator and that Africans were seen by Europeans as being culturally advanced in the 15th century. William E.

He said, [...] "One of the things we're trying to do is let people have the additional insight and appreciation for the contributions of African Americans to this wonderful country and more specifically to the state of California", adding that [...] "the Queen Califia exhibit is particularly poignant." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
