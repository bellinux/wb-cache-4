5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The final {{part of the}} {{ceremony}} was marked with <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> of lots. It was assisted by Vladimir Kramnik and Hou Yifan as the highest-rated players of the highest-ranked teams in the open and women's event, respectively, who joined the Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov for <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> of colours. The draw resulted in Hou picking the White pieces, meaning that all players in the women's section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will be White in the first round; and Kramnik picking the Black pieces, meaning that all players in the open section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will have the Black pieces in the opening round.|$|E

5|$|Designed by Burges for himself, the Zodiac settle was {{originally}} placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House {{was designed by}} Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House {{until his death in}} 1881, and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> room windows in Tower House. The decoration of <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> room remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T.H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold.|$|E
5|$|John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, who he {{regarded}} like a son, drew {{a sketch of}} the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> placed participants and selected witnesses on Fremont Street in Tombstone, and Earp annotated it with lines indicating how the participants moved during the 30-second shootout. It was sold at auction by Alexander Autographs in early October 2010, for $380,000.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} Merchant Navy class was undertaken by <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> office at Brighton works, but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to {{a limited number of}} personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|The S-IVB orbital {{workshop}} was {{the only}} one of these plans to make it off <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board. Dubbed Skylab, it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Under his ownership, <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> Room was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style, In the process, Crace's {{stencilling}} {{was over}} painted and then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and the carpet dyed by Sketchleys. In 1917, {{to assist the}} war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork melted down for ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} years, {{the running}} order was not decided by <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> of lots, but instead by the producers, {{with the aim}} of making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out. The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|When Beswick's family home, Cheetwood Old Hall was {{demolished}} in 1890 to {{make way}} for a brickyard, contractors discovered a double coffin buried underneath <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> room, the mystery of the burial was never solved but at the time it was thought to be connected to the Beswick family and Dr White who had resided at the hall after Hannah Beswick removed to Oldham.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the game}} is only {{available}} in Hong Kong, some people play it illegally in other countries, particularly in Mainland China. The reason for such popularity is because <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> takes place in Hong Kong and is broadcast live on television {{to ensure that no}} one can manipulate <b>the</b> <b>draw.</b> This is contrary to many lotteries in mainland China, where <b>the</b> <b>draws</b> are not broadcast live and there are many reports indicating that <b>the</b> <b>draws</b> are manipulated.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>draw</b> for <b>the</b> fifth round {{was made}} live on Sky Sports {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} the Albion Rovers-Celtic match on 22 January 2017. <b>The</b> <b>draw</b> was made by former Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs and Celtic fan Rod Stewart, who memorably performed his part of <b>the</b> <b>draw</b> in an enthusiastic manner.|$|R
5|$|While {{most other}} museums were using cast or sculpted Camarasaurus skulls on Apatosaurus mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull {{based on the}} lower jaw of a Camarasaurus, with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 {{illustration}} of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> and other skulls.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|Bembo's {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. From these drawings, Benton-pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
