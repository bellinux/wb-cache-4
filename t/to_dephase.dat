40|$|Resonant {{tunneling}} through identical potential barriers is {{a textbook}} problem in quantum mechanics. Its solution yields total transparency (100 % tunneling) at discrete energies. This dramatic phenomenon results from coherent interference among many trajectories, {{and it is}} the basis of transport through periodic structures. Resonant tunneling of electrons is commonly seen in semiconducting 'quantum dots'. Here we demonstrate that detecting (distinguishing) electron trajectories in a quantum dot (QD) renders the QD nearly insulating. We couple trajectories in the QD to a 'detector' by employing edge channels in the integer quantum Hall regime. That is, we couple electrons tunneling through an inner channel to electrons in the neighboring outer, 'detector' channel. A small bias applied to the detector channel suffices <b>to</b> <b>dephase</b> (quench) the resonant tunneling completely. We derive a formula for dephasing that agrees well with our data and implies that just a few electrons passing through the detector channel suffice <b>to</b> <b>dephase</b> the QD completely.

40|$|Motivated by {{the spin}} self-rephasing {{recently}} observed in an atomic clock, we introduce a simple dynamical model {{to study the}} competition between dephasing and synchronization. Two spins S are taken to be initially parallel and in the plane perpendicular to an inhomogeneous magnetic field Δ that tends <b>to</b> <b>dephase</b> them. In addition, the spins are coupled by exchange interaction J that tries to keep them locked. The analytical solution of the classical dynamics shows that, there is a phase transition to a synchronized regime for sufficiently large exchange interaction J>Δ compared to the inhomogeneity. The quantum dynamics is solved analytically in four limits [...] large/small J/Δ and large/small S [...] and numerically in between. In {{sharp contrast to the}} classical case, the quantum solution features very rich S-dependent multiscale dynamics. For any finite S, there is no synchronization but a crossover around J=Δ between two regimes. The synchronization transition is only recovered when S→∞, approaching the classical solution in a non-trivial way. Quantum effects therefore suppress the synchronization transition.

40|$|Purpose: To report {{possible}} erroneous {{estimates of}} diffusion parameters in the twice-refocused spin-echo (TRSE) technique, proposed to eliminate eddy-current-induced geometric distortions in diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging, when stimulated echo signals are inappropriately included. Materials and Methods: Eleven subjects were included for imaging experiments on two 1. 5 Tesla systems using the TRSE sequence. Three versions, two with unbalanced crusher gradients inserted <b>to</b> <b>dephase</b> the stimulated echo from the b = 0 images {{and one with}} balanced crusher gradients, were implemented. The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived and compared. Results: The ADCs obtained with unbalanced crusher gradients were closer to values reported in the literature. Stimulated echo led to ADC over-estimations by 34. 2 %, 50. 4 %, 54. 0 %, 51. 5 %, 24. 0 %, and 41. 9 % in the genu of corpus callosum, splenium of corpus callosum, bilateral corona radiata, internal capsule, mediofrontal gyrus, and the cuneus, respectively (P < 0. 01), with concomitant reduction in FA in highly anisotropic regions. Over-estimations of diffusion coefficients {{were found to be}} roughly equal along all directions. Conclusion: Formation of stimulated echo in the TRSE technique can lead to erroneous estimations of the diffusion parameters, even if no prominent morphological artifacts are seen. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
