25|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company {{for a long period}} of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>kids,</b> or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.|$|E

In 2009, Azaria told Empire he was instead focusing on making a documentary about fatherhood. Two years later he told the Los Angeles Times that this project was [...] "half-complete" [...] and was [...] "forever looking for financing to finish it."

5000|$|Selfish Reasons <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> More <b>Kids</b> is a 2011 book {{arguing that}} people often work too hard in child-rearing, {{and as a}} result, they are scared {{of the idea of}} <b>having</b> <b>kids.</b> Caplan's book urged parents to relax with respect to child-rearing. The book argues that as the {{perceived}} costs (in terms of child-rearing expense and effort) of <b>having</b> <b>kids</b> fell, it made sense <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more <b>kids</b> based on the basic theory of supply and demand. The book was reviewed in Wall Street Journal. The book was also reviewed by The Guardian, RealClearMarkets and the Washington Times. The book also led to debates sponsored by the Wall Street Journal and The Guardian. The Guardian had Caplan debating [...] "Tiger Mom" [...] Amy Chua on the merits of strict parenting style.

[...] Hannah admits that she and Simon had a difficult relationship, but has an alibi placing her in Glasgow at the time after an argument. As more pieces of the interviews are discovered, it is claimed that [...] "Hannah" [...] is actually two women: Hannah and Eve, identical twins separated at birth by the midwife, Florence. Florence was the widow of a war veteran who desparately wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>kids,</b> but {{did not believe in}} remarrying, so she faked the death of one of the twins to claim one for herself. Florence deliberately keeps Eve indoors as much as possible, much to the latter's frustration. The twins were unaware of each other's existence until years later, at which point they decided to act as a single person, keeping a common diary and a set of rules defining their actions as [...] "Hannah".

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four, and said [...] "It's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality.

2500|$|At Elimination Chamber, Nikki Bella and Natalya had a {{backstage}} confrontation {{that lead}} to Natalya shoving Nikki into Maryse. Later that night, The Miz attempted to eliminate John Cena from the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match only for Miz to get eliminated by Cena. On the February 21 episode of SmackDown, Nikki and Natalya's Falls Count Anywhere match led to the backstage area, where Natalya again shoved Nikki into Maryse, who retaliated by attacking Nikki with a lead pipe, thus costing her the match. In that episode's main event, the same incident between Cena and Miz happened in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, but this time, Miz returned and caused Cena's elimination. Cena was then the guest on Miz TV where Miz criticized Cena for being a hypocrite, as Cena was basically {{doing the same thing}} that he himself had criticized The Rock for doing: leaving the WWE and going to Hollywood. Miz said that he works as hard as Cena, but does not get the same opportunities, and he eliminated Cena to prevent him from going to WrestleMania 33 and wanted Cena to know what he felt when Cena defeated him for the WWE Championship back in 2011. Miz also said that Cena gets what he wants, but Cena said if that were true, he would be facing The Undertaker. Cena then criticized Miz for copying other people's gimmicks and moves, which caused Maryse to slap Cena for insulting her husband. Nikki then came out and Maryse and Miz retreated. The following week, The Miz and Maryse attacked Cena and Nikki after the latter two's match against James Ellsworth and Carmella. The Miz said he was tired of Cena's lies and said his relationship with Nikki was also a lie. Afterwards on Talking Smack, The Miz and Maryse said that Nikki was in her current position because of her relationship with Cena and that Nikki was jealous of them because Cena would not marry Nikki. The following week, Miz and Maryse continued their insults against Cena and Nikki and the two came out and chased Miz and Maryse out of the ring. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then came out and said that since he could not fight The Miz, who had been insulting him for several months, both The Miz and Maryse would face Cena and Nikki at WrestleMania; Maryse's last match was in 2011. The Miz and Maryse then made fun of Cena and Nikki's reality show Total Bellas by impersonating them in [...] "unaired footage". On March 27, Cena was a guest host on NBC's Today and revealed weatherman Al Roker as the guest ring announcer for the match. On the final SmackDown before WrestleMania, more [...] "unaired footage" [...] from Total Bellas was shown. The Miz and Maryse then threw more insults at Cena and Nikki, including Cena not wanting <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>kids.</b> Cena retaliated and asked how many kids Miz and Maryse had. Cena said that although he takes time off to make movies, he comes back to WWE when he is done, just as The Miz and other WWE Superstars have done before. Cena called Maryse a waste of a paycheck as she does not do much on the show and that she was only back in the WWE because Miz begged for it. Cena then said that he and Nikki would destroy Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania.|$|E
