5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating <b>taller</b> buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in <b>taller</b> buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in <b>taller</b> buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout <b>taller</b> buildings for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of <b>taller</b> buildings during the 1870s was hindered {{by the financial}} Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and property values slumped. By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic upturn making the {{construction of}} <b>taller</b> buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions {{for the development of}} the skyscraper.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers <b>taller</b> than , leaving the development of <b>taller</b> buildings to New York.|$|E

5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this {{was the result of}} improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made <b>taller</b> buildings easier to ascend. Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling <b>taller</b> projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium rents. The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the <b>taller</b> a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories. 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.|$|E
5|$|The added {{height of}} the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest {{building}} {{in the world and}} the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure.

The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E
