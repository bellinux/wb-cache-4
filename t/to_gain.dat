Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to run out the clock.

5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E

40|$|Strategies for {{sustainably}} using biofuels must {{be thoroughly}} assessed at several levels. First, {{the use of}} biofuels must comply with sustainable development’s main dimensions. Second, the use of biofuels must comply with sustainable transport’s main dimensions. Third, gains from using biofuels strategies must compare favorably <b>to</b> <b>gains</b> from other sustainable transport strategies, such as altering transport patterns and reducing transport volume. Fourth, the gains must compare favorably <b>to</b> <b>gains</b> from improving conventional fossil-fuel-based advanced vehicles. Fifth, the gains must compare favorably <b>to</b> <b>gains</b> from using other alternative fuels. Sixth, the gains from using one generation of biofuels (e. g., first generation) must compare favorably <b>to</b> <b>gains</b> from using others (e. g., second through fourth generations). Performing scientifically sound and fair comparisons demands reliable theoretical perspectives and a well-established methodological basis. Industrial ecology theory and life cycle assessment methodology, respectively, are well-suited for these tasks.
