5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight turning radius, but they suffered from weather helm and tended <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two picket boats, one launch, two yawls, and one dinghy. These were handled with a large derrick that was fitted to the main mast.|$|E

50|$|Akin to {{many other}} inlets along the Outer Banks, Oregon Inlet moves southward due <b>to</b> <b>drifting</b> sands during tides and storms. It has moved south over two miles since 1846, {{averaging}} around 66 feet per year.|$|R
40|$|Observers adapted <b>to</b> <b>drifting</b> {{patterns}} varying {{either in}} luminance (first-order pattern), or in contrast (second-order pattern). Sensitivity to increases or decreases in {{the speed of}} the first-order pattern increased sharply as adaptation time increased, but sensitivity to speed changes of the second-order pattern remained unchanged throughout the adaptation time. Adaptation of first-order motion mechanisms seems thus to mediate increased sensitivity to variations in speed around the adapting speed. No evidence was found for such effects of adaptation to second-order motion. The observed differences in the effects of adaptation accord well with reports of fundamental differences between after-effects <b>to</b> <b>drifting</b> first- and second-order patterns and are in harmony with models of motion perception emphasizing different mechanisms for the detection of first- and second-order motion...|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough extended from the Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) south-southwest of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E

5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E
5|$|Continuing <b>to</b> <b>drift,</b> Cofresí and {{his crew}} were {{captured}} after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. Cofresí and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking the locks on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night on a rope made from their clothing. With Cofresí were two other inmates: a man known as Portalatín and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of El Scipión. After reaching the province of San Pedro de Macorís, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where Portalatín disembarked. From there {{they went to the}} island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|He {{revealed}} in his 1996 autobiography {{that he had}} a strained relationship with his brother Bobby. Though the pair had different personalities, Jack felt that Bobby began <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> away from the Charlton family following his marriage to Norma, who did not get along with their mother. Bobby did not see his mother after 1992 until her death on 25 March 1996 {{as a result of the}} feud, though he and Norma did attend her funeral. Though the two brothers remained distant, Jack presented Bobby with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and allowed it <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> {{in the ice}} towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E

5|$|Intermittent {{bursts of}} deep {{convection}} kept satellite intensity estimates at 40mph (65km/h) {{through the morning}} of June28. After becoming embedded within a low-level westerly flow, the system began to slowly execute a small counter-clockwise loop. That afternoon, Celia degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system; operationally, the system was monitored as a tropical depression for an additional six hours before the final advisory from the NHC was issued. The remnants of Celia continued <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> towards the north before finally dissipating on June30, about 990mi (1,590km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|Steering {{currents}} above Alicia remained weak {{during the}} storm's lifetime. However, a ridge was well formed {{to the north}} of the developing storms. With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began <b>to</b> <b>drift</b> to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one millibar an hour in the 40hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at 115mph (185km/h) in winds and 962millibars (28.39inHg) in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category3hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.|$|E
