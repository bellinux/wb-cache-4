5|$|According to the Prose Edda, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> ends {{in heaven}} at Himinbjörg, the {{residence}} of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar. The bridge's destruction during Ragnarök {{by the forces of}} Muspell is foretold. Scholars have proposed that <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and another bridge in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.|$|E
5|$|Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl {{installed}} planking {{and guard}} rails {{on the southern}} half of <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> which was then opened to the public. He allowed bungee jumping off <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to bungee jump off <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> without a restraining cord. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> was slightly damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as he believed it would be cheaper to import <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> than build a new one.

5|$|On 1 April 1979, {{the first}} modern bungee jumps were made from <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{by members of the}} University of Oxford Dangerous Sports Club. In 2003 and 2004, the weight of crowds {{travelling}} to and from the Ashton Court Festival and Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such great strain on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> that it was decided to close <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to all motor traffic and pedestrians during the events. The closure of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> for major annual events has continued each year since then.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November 2003, {{the last}} ever Concorde flight (Concorde 216) flew over <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> before landing at Filton Aerodrome. In April 2006, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was the centrepiece of the Brunel 200 weekend, celebrating the 200th {{anniversary of the}} birth of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. At the climax of the celebration a {{firework}} display was launched from <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The celebrations also saw the activation of an LED-based lighting array to illuminate <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1864, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was lit by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, {{but they}} were blown out by the wind.

5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{for a few}} hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and {{photographs from the}} time of opening consulted, and <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was restored to its original appearance. The main body of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several {{proposals}} from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic retrofit and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend the life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge's</b> name {{dates from}} a 19th-century {{tradition}} of color-coding <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> crossing <b>the</b> Moika River. Like other colored <b>bridges,</b> <b>the</b> Blue <b>Bridge</b> {{got its name}} from the color of its sides facing the river. Today only four colored <b>bridges</b> survive, <b>the</b> other ones being <b>the</b> Red <b>Bridge,</b> <b>the</b> Green <b>Bridge</b> and <b>the</b> Yellow <b>Bridge</b> respectively. Three of them kept their original names, while Yellow Bridge has been renamed to Pevchesky Bridge.|$|R

5|$|Starting in October 2006, the Toll Bridge Commission {{began an}} $8.8. million {{rehabilitation}} of the structure. The rehabilitation helped {{extend the life of}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> for years rather than shutting <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> down constantly for the next 15 years for major repairs. The Commission replaced the flooring, repairing or replacing of certain steel portions of <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> blast-cleaning and repainted the structure.|$|E
5|$|Strengthening {{works were}} carried out on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> by Structural Systems Ltd in 1996.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{situated}} in a historically significant area.

5|$|The {{historical}} {{significance of the}} location {{has been used as}} the basis for a number of proposals to rename <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> In 1921 the Chicago Historical Society suggested that <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> should be named Marquette–Joliet Bridge, and in 1939 it was proposed to rename <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> as Fort Dearborn Bridge.

5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had to cross over <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> To prevent the breakdown of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to be less than one and a half tonnes.

5|$|Throughout 2016 the {{necessary}} repairs {{were made and}} as of November 2016 <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> is once again open to traffic.

5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was kept under routine maintenance, and <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only thing is that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply.
