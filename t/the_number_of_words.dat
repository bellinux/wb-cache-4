5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

The English titles published at Sheena and Tokyo Jihen's personal production agency website, Kronekodow, also follow a similar style.

25|$|The {{second most}} common metre in Roman comedy in terms of lines (or the commonest, in terms of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words)</b> is the trochaic septenarius (tr7). Like the other long iambic and trochaic lines, it is {{believed}} to have been chanted to the music of the tibiae (double pipes). There is usually a diaeresis in the centre of the line, and there may sometimes also be a hiatus (lack of elision) or brevis in longo (a short syllable made long by position) at this point. Trochaic lines generally start with a word which is stressed on the first syllable, making it clear that the line has a trochaic not an iambic rhythm.|$|E

30|$|For the {{prediction}} of depression, between May and June in 2013, we collected data from 1000 participants (male: 426, female: 574).

25|$|Some {{spaces of}} the tables are not filled, {{but this does not}} mean that there are no words which would fit. The sounds a, e (end-firm when stressed) and i, u (short) can not be start-firm and {{consequently}} the word having them in the next-to-last stressed syllable can not be of the first and the third accentuation pattern. Some of the declensional types include few words, for example there are only two words of the third accentuation pattern in the fifth declension: sūnùs and lietùs. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> (Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language / Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000) of the declensional patterns can be checked in the section above.|$|E
25|$|The final Masorah {{is located}} at the end of biblical books or after certain {{sections}} of the text, such as {{at the end of the}} Torah. It contains information and statistics regarding <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> in a book or section, etc. Thus, Book of Leviticus 8:23 is the middle verse in the Pentateuch. The collation of manuscripts and the noting of their differences furnished material for the Text-Critical Masorah. The close relation which existed in earlier times (from the Soferim to the Amoraim inclusive) between the teacher of tradition and the Masorete, both frequently being united in one person, accounts for the Exegetical Masorah. Finally, the invention and introduction of a graphic system of vocalization and accentuation gave rise to the Grammatical Masorah.|$|E
25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E

A manual evaluation of phrase pair quality showed that the increase in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> unaligned <b>words</b> results in a lower quality.

500|$|From the 5th century, {{the role}} of the horse in Anglo-Saxon culture is partly {{illustrated}} by <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> for [...] "horse" [...] in Old English. These distinguish between cart horses (two words), pack horses (two words), riding horses (three words), horses for breeding (three words, male and female), horses suitable for royalty and aristocracy (five words, of which three were mainly used in poetry), and warhorses (one word). There was no word for [...] "plough horse," [...] and no evidence that horses were used for ploughing in Anglo-Saxon times, when this was still done by ox teams; but Domesday Book records a horse used for harrowing, in 1086. Horses were used predominantly for transporting goods and people; numerous English place-names, such as Stadhampton, Stoodleigh and Studham, refer to the keeping of [...] "studs", in this case [...] "herds", of horses; and Anglo-Saxon stirrups and spurs have been found by archaeologists. Horses were also raced for sport, and a [...] "race-course" [...] in Kent is mentioned in a charter of King Eadred, dated 949.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{majority}} of modern Chinese words contain more than one character, {{there are at least}} two measuring sticks for Chinese literacy: the number of characters known, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> known. [...] John DeFrancis, in the introduction to his Advanced Chinese Reader, estimates that a typical Chinese college graduate recognizes 4,000 to 5,000 characters, and 40,000 to 60,000 words. [...] Jerry Norman, in Chinese, places the number of characters somewhat lower, at 3,000 to 4,000. These counts are complicated by the tangled development of Chinese characters. [...] In many cases, a single character came to be written in multiple ways. This development was restrained to an extent by the standardization of the seal script during the Qin dynasty, but soon started again. Although the Shuowen Jiezi lists 10,516 characters—9,353 of them unique (some of which may already have been out of use by the time it was compiled) plus 1,163 graphic variants—the Jiyun of the Northern Song Dynasty, compiled less than a thousand years later in 1039, contains 53,525 characters, most of them graphic variants.|$|E

Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (NED).|$|E

30|$|The {{results provide}} partial support for our {{hypothesis}} that increasing spreading activation in emotional memory networks {{would be associated}} with greater changes in heart rate and skin conductance due to the cumulative effect <b>of</b> an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> somatic markers being activated.

However, there were some differences between the happy and sad conditions as well as between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> emotional memory <b>words</b> and the average ages of the memories. Specifically, there was a significant positive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> happy <b>word</b> memories and heart rate but a significant negative relationship between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> happy <b>word</b> memories and skin conductance. No significant relationships were found between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sad <b>word</b> memories and either heart rate or skin conductance. However, the average ages <b>of</b> the sad <b>word</b> memories was significantly positively correlated with skin conductance, but not with heart rate.
