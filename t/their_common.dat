40|$|Unlike forest commons in {{many other}} countries, within Europe and elsewhere, Swedish forest commons are for- med and {{organised}} {{in a particular way}} in that the parcels (or shares) of forestlands involved are privately owned but as commons they are jointly managed by forest pro- fessionals. Furthermore, shares in forest commons are considered as “set asides” of the private landholding (farm/forest) and thus cannot be owned or sold in isolation. This leaves little space for the shareholders to be ‘hands-on’ in the management of these commons, although they are involved in decision making through a management board they elect. Moreover, it has been claimed that the shareholders in the Swedish forest commons do not bear the costs (for management and governance) proportional to the benefits they receive from <b>their</b> <b>commons.</b>   In this paper, we use data from a mail survey directed to resident shareholders in three of the major forest com- mons in Sweden (Jokkmokk, Tärna-Stensele, and Älvda- len) to assess their satisfaction on the governance and benefits sharing within <b>their</b> forest <b>commons.</b> This study shows that generally a significant majority of the share- holders in these three forest commons seem to be satis- fied with the status quo regarding the governance/ management of <b>their</b> <b>commons</b> and the benefits they accrue. However, women’s participation in most aspects of the forest commons seems to be significantly lower than their male counterpart leaving them benefiting less from <b>their</b> <b>commons</b> as a result...|$|R

5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an {{unconventional}} lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction. His literary debut came late in life, closely following {{the start of}} his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and <b>their</b> <b>common</b> affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later criticism has often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, {{as one of the most}} accomplished representatives of Junimist literature.|$|E
