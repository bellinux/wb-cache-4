40|$|<b>Temelastine</b> is a selective, {{competitive}} histamine HI-receptor antagonist {{which does}} not penetrate the central nervous system. -The effect of varying doses of <b>temelastine</b> was compared in a randomized, double-blind, con-trolled study by measuring the inhibition of cutaneous histamine wheals. In twelve subjects single oral doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg of <b>temelastine</b> produced dose-dependent reductions in wheal areas. The inhibition of wheal size was maximal by 2 hr after dosing and was present at 8 hr. At 2 hr the 50, 100, and 200 mg doses reduced the wheal size by 53, 64, and 78 %, respectively. Chlorpheniramine, 4 mg, reduced wheal size by 32 % at the same period. The ability of <b>temelastine</b> to antagonize the histamine-induced skin reaction over 20 hr was evaluated in a second randomized, double-blind study. Eight subjectsparticipated. <b>Temelastine,</b> 100 mg, produced reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of theophylline (i. v. aminophylline 250 mg) {{were studied}} in a balanced, double-blind crossover following {{the administration of}} oral <b>temelastine</b> (100 mg) or placebo, twice daily for 7 days, to 10 normal volunteers. Comparison of volumes of distribution, elimination rate constants, elimination half-lives and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve indicated that <b>temelastine</b> had no significant effect on theophylline pharmacokinetics...|$|E
40|$|Modern non-sedating {{histamine}} H- 1 -receptor antagonists (e. g. terfenadine, <b>temelastine,</b> cetirizine, astemizole) {{are considered}} to be devoid of CNS side-effects because, {{as a result of their}} physicochemical properties, they do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in sufficient amounts. In the present study lipophilicity parameters considered to be of importance for brain penetration capability (such as log P-oct, log D-oct,D- 7,D- 4, Delta log P and boolean AND(alkane)) were determined for a series of structurally different sedating and non-sedating histamine H- 1 -receptor antagonists. These parameters were obtained from log P-oct and log P-alk values measured by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), a new and efficient method for measuring partition coefficients. From the lipophilicity data obtained it appears that the (non) -sedative effects of antihistamines cannot be correctly accounted for by brain penetration models that use only H-bonding (Delta log P) or hydration capacity (boolean AND(alkane)) as a parameter. Indeed, in this series of usually basic H- 1 -blockers, ionization also appears to play an important role. We conclude that sedative effects displayed by antihistamines are better explained by the parameter log D-oct. 7. 4, the octanol/water distribution coefficient of both neutral and ionized species at pH 7. 4. For neural organic compounds it was found that brain penetration is highest if they have a logP(oct) value of approximately 2 ('principle of minimal hydrophobicity'). Our data suggest that this principle is also applicable to ionizable drugs when logD(oct 7. 4) is used instead of logP(oct). A tentative qualitative model for designing antihistamines without CNS side-effects is presente...|$|E
40|$|SK&F 93944 (<b>temelastine),</b> a novel {{histamine}} H 1 -receptor antagonist, {{has been}} studied {{in a variety of}} in vitro and in vivo test systems. SK&F 93944 was a competitive antagonist of histamine-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum with a pA 2 of 9. 55 and a weak, non-competitive, inhibitor of the effects of histamine on guinea-pig atrium. In anaesthetized guinea-pigs SK&F 93944 displaced histamine bronchoconstriction dose-response curves at doses which had negligible effects on histamine tachycardia. In anaesthetized cats SK&F 93944 antagonized depressor responses to the histamine H 1 -receptor agonists, 2 -(2 -aminoethyl) pyridine and betahistine, at doses which had no effects on responses to the histamine H 2 -receptor agonist, dimaprit. Oral pretreatment with SK&F 93944 in conscious rats and guinea-pigs afforded protection versus the response to intradermal histamine injection. Comparative studies in each of the test systems showed that SK&F 93944 was of comparable or significantly greater potency than the standard compound, mepyramine. SK&F 93944 was found to be a weak, non-competitive antagonist of carbachol on the guinea-pig ileum but was devoid of measurable anticholinergic activity in vivo. Studies on the penetration of [14 C]-SK&F 93944, labelled either in the isocytosine ring or in the butyl chain, showed that brain concentrations were very low when compared with the steady-state blood concentrations. In contrast, brain concentrations of [3 H]-mepyramine exceeded blood concentrations by a factor of approximately 3. SK&F 93944 may have an advantage over classical histamine H 1 -receptor antagonists in that {{it is likely to be}} devoid of untoward effects on the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|In {{pharmacotherapy}} for bronchitis and asthma, anti-hista-mines and anti-allergic {{drugs can}} be used concomitantly with theophylline (TP) to avoid induction of bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the respiratory tract. Some anti-hista-mines such as azelastine, ketotifen, mequitazine, mizolastine, pemiropast potassium, picumast dihydrochloride, repirinast, <b>temelastine</b> and terfenadine have been reported not to inter-act adversely with TP. 1) However, doqualast accelerated elim-ination of TP by increasing the free fraction in blood, and ke-totifen also decreased the serum level of TP. 2) TP has a nar-row therapeutic range in serum level of 10 â€” 20 mg/ml and can interact with other drugs in its metabolic process. 1, 3) Since many kinds of anti-allergic drugs have been developed and are commercially available, pharmacokinetic evaluation of the possible interaction between anti-allergic drugs and TP is important. Suplatast (ST), () -[2 -[4 -(3 -ethoxy- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) -phenylcarbamoyl]ethyl]dimethylsulfonium p-toluenesulfo-nate, is a novel anti-allergic drug and can inhibit not only production of IgE antibody but also type I allergic reaction. 4) That means ST can block both {{the first and second}} steps in an allergic reaction. In clinical practice, ST has been used for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhini-tis. Anti-allergic drugs can be administered in association with TP, however, no interaction between ST and TP has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of ST on pharmacokinetics of TP in rats. A pharmacokinetic study in vivo was performed, and TP metabolism was also exam-ined in rat-liver microsomes in vitro. Finally, the inhibitory effect of ST and its main metabolite, M 1, on TP metabolism was demonstrated...|$|E
