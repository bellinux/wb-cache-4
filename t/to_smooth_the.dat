5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E

25|$|A lathe is an {{adjustable}} horizontal metal rail and a tool rest, between {{the material and}} the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools.

40|$|The aimed of {{this study}} was to examine the {{influence}} of company’s characterictics toward income smoothing practice among listed companies at Indonesian Stock Exchange. Income smoothing practice used by the management to diminish the variability of a stream of reported income numbers related to some perceived target stream by manipulating artificial (accounting) and real (transactional) variables (Koch, 1981). 	The factors being examined were profitability, size of the company, financial leverage, dividend payout ratio. Index Eckel is used <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> income <b>smoothing</b> practice. <b>The</b> object of income smoothing in this study is the net profit of the company. The study was using 38 companies listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange, with a period between 2004 - 2008. The hypothesis was tested using binary logistic regression. The first hypothesis was used to examine the influence of profitability <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing.</b> <b>The</b> second hypothesis was used to examine the influence of size of <b>the</b> company <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing.</b> <b>The</b> third hypothesis was used to examine the influence of financial leverage <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing.</b> <b>The</b> fourth hypothesis was used to examine the influence of dividend payout ratios <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing.</b> 	<b>The</b> result {{of this study}} showed that some of the listed companies at Indonesian Stock Exchange were committed <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing</b> practice. Binary logistic regression showed that size of the company and financial leverage did not have significant influence <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing.</b> Only profitability and dividend payout ratios have significant influence <b>to</b> income <b>smoothing.</b> Keywords : Profitability, size of the company, financial leverage, dividend payout ratio ratios, income smoothing...|$|R
25|$|Small {{listening}} rooms {{suffer a}} paucity of low frequency resonances with gaps between them, so another complementary method is adding a subwoofer to drive the room resonances from an optimal physical location that minimizes ripple in the frequency response at the listening position. Yet another complementary method is splitting an existing subwoofer allocation up into multiple smaller subwoofers in spatially separated locations that increase the degrees of freedom available to tune the response with. Multiple subwoofers also tend <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> bass response across a larger listening area and are often easier to place for good bass response than a single larger subwoofer (or no subwoofer).|$|E
25|$|The Reichsmark was {{introduced}} in 1924 as a permanent replacement for the Papiermark. This was necessary due to the 1920s German inflation which had reached its peak in 1923. The exchange rate between the old Papiermark and the Reichsmark was 1 ℛℳ = 1012 Papiermark (one trillion in US English and French, one billion in German and other European languages and UK English of the time, see long and short scales). To stabilize the economy and <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> transition, the Papiermark was not directly replaced by the Reichsmark, but by the Rentenmark, an interim currency backed by the Deutsche Rentenbank, owning industrial and agricultural real estate assets. The Reichsmark {{was put on the}} gold standard at the rate previously used by the Goldmark, with the U.S. dollar worth 4.2 ℛℳ.|$|E

Ismail, himself a more capable man than his immediate predecessors, at once recognized the ability of Nubar, and charged him with a mission to Constantinople, not only to notify his accession, but <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> way for the many ambitious projects he already entertained, notably the completion of the Suez Canal, the change in title to that of khedive and the change in the order of succession.|$|E

Barât, however, was already attending a party organized by some of his friends, and the hosts convinced him not to leave. Doherty was left to play the gig himself. Feeling betrayed, Doherty neglected to take the train to Germany the next day for the Libertines' European tour. The Libertines were forced to play without Doherty: a guitar technician learned his guitar parts and several songs were dropped altogether. Soon, however, positions changed and it was Barât who refused to let Doherty into the band unless he cleaned himself up. Doherty continued to play with separate musical project Babyshambles whilst the Libertines completed tour commitments in Japan without him. Distraught and angry, Doherty burgled Barât's flat and was subsequently arrested. On 11 August, he pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing {{to the charge of}} burglary.|$|E
