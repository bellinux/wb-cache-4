5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E
5|$|Navigating <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> slowed progress, and {{the mistaken}} {{use by the}} First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to {{identify}} their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned. On 15 August, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade continued the offensive, but progress remained slow. The 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to Trun. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from Waffen SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.|$|E

Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed around town. Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she is when she throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots him in the eye, finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before saddling up and riding out of the town.|$|E

25|$|The new {{division}} {{was still being}} formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Gerät beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that {{broke out in the}} congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19–22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton.|$|E
25|$|Sir Hugh Rose, on {{arriving}} at Poonch, sent Major Gall to the fort at Lohari. The fort and village of Lohari were situated in an extensive level plain. The fort itself was square and flanked by round towers at the corners. It had a ditch {{and a second}} line of works outside the ditch. A company of the 3rd Europeans crossed the open space between the village and fort without opposition and established themselves in a guard-house close to the ditch. The garrison of the fort paid no heed to the summons of surrender. Major Gall concluded that no option remained, after reconnaissance, but to open the third gate {{with a bag of}} gunpowder and carry the fort by storm. Twenty-five files of the 3rd Europeans, under Lieutenants Armstrong and Donne and Ensign Newport occupied the gateways as the storming party. Lieutenant Bonus, Bombay Engineers, under the cover of sharp fire from the 3rd Europeans, placed the powder-bag in front of the closed gate, and the firing party withdrew. The explosion occurred and the storming 3rd Europeans rushed in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> and almost immediately met the enemy face to face. The stormers were assailed by a shower of stones and brickbats as well as by men who cut, stabbed and shot at them from the walls. Lieutenant Donne and Ensign Newport were severely wounded while fighting hand-to-hand, but beat off their assailants and retreated under bayonet protection. Lieutenant Rose now came opportunely to the front for a final charge and the 3rd Europeans, with some of the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, drove their foe before them and a bloody melee ensued. A last stand by the foe near the gateway was also crushed. The bugler private, Private Whirlpool, who made it through the gate first in the final charge, later received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. The 3rd Bombay Europeans had a toll of 1 killed in action and 17 wounded.|$|E
500|$|The {{battalion}} commander was killed, and soon afterwards, orders arrived to seek and destroy any enemy combatants around NaHa. On June 11, 1945, Kizirian was assigned the special task of patrolling to locate elements {{of an enemy}} reserve platoon.

Disregarding his own safety, Kizirian placed himself {{in the line of}} fire and single-handedly attacked the enemy emplacement. The Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces that confronted Kizirian shot him in the legs and abdomen. Unable to walk, he still managed to make his way forward using his elbows to a position where he was able to shoot and kill all 12 soldiers manning the machine gun. Due to these actions, Kizirian was awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest medal in the United States military. The citation provides details about the event: ...|$|E

500|$|At 10:10 Lieutenant Commander Gerard Broadmead Roope, fired five torpedoes {{from one}} {{mounting}} {{at a range}} of , but all missed because Captain Hellmuth Heye had kept Hippers bow pointed at Glowworm throughout the battle to minimize his risk from torpedoes. The destroyer fell back through her smoke screen to buy time to get her second torpedo mount working, but Heye followed Glowworm <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> to finish her off before she could fire {{the rest of her}} torpedoes. The two ships were very close when Hipper emerged from the smoke and Roope ordered a hard turn to starboard to reduce the range and possibly ram the cruiser. Hipper was slow to answer her helm and Glowworm struck the cruiser just [...] the anchor. The collision broke off Glowworms bow {{and the rest of the}} ship scraped along Hippers side, gouging open several holes in the latter's hull and destroying her forward starboard torpedo mounting. One German sailor was knocked overboard by the collision. Hipper took on some [...] of water before the leaks could be isolated, but was not seriously damaged. Glowworm was on fire when she drifted clear and her boilers exploded at 10:24, taking 109 of her crew with her.|$|E

For this attack the carrier embarked 880 Squadron with three Seafire L.IICs, 20 Grumman Hellcats of 1840 Squadron, Barracudas of 830 Squadron and three Swordfish of 842 Flight. [...] The Barracudas, heavily loaded with bombs of up to , launched using a wooden ramp: an early example {{of what was to}} be later named the ski-jump. The attack was unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences as a smokescreen covered the German battleship so that the Barracudas had to drop their bombs blindly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke.</b> Four more attacks on Tirpitz were made in August under the name of Operation Goodwood in a concerted effort to sink her. Furious carried twelve Seafire F.IIIs of 801 Squadron, another twelve Seafire L.IICs of 880 Squadron and nine Barracudas of 827 Squadron for this operation. The first attack on 20 August was recalled because of bad weather, but the attack on 22 August was spotted by the Germans and 11 aircraft were lost. Another attack was made two days later; one armour-piercing bomb penetrated Tirpitzs armoured deck but failed to detonate, and another [...] bomb did only superficial damage. A fourth attack was made on 29 August, but inflicted no damage.|$|E
500|$|The Chandler's shop at Union Street, as {{depicted}} in a contemporary newspaper illustration, occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys. The family lived above the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six-year-old son Henry, and Ayres sharing a room {{on the second floor}} with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen, and three-year-old Elizabeth. On the night of [...] 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, trapping the family upstairs. Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building, causing the flames to spread rapidly. Although the shop was near the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade and the emergency services were quickly on scene, by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows, making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders. Meanwhile, Ayres, wearing only a nightdress, had tried to reach her sister but was unable to get to her <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke.</b> The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump. Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window, carefully dropping Edith onto it. Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself, she left the window and returned carrying Ellen. Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped, but Ayres threw her out of the building, and the child was caught {{by a member of the}} crowd. Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth, whom she dropped safely onto the mattress.|$|E

Only a single soldier had been slightly injured, even though the column had come [...] through a near-constant barrage of gunfire.|$|E
2500|$|As at Bealtaine, bonfires were lit on hilltops at Samhain {{and there}} were rituals {{involving}} them. However, by the modern era, they only {{seem to have been}} common in parts of the Scottish Highlands, on the Isle of Man, in north and mid Wales, and in parts of Ulster. F. Marian McNeill says that a force-fire (or need-fire) was the traditional way of lighting them, but notes that this method gradually died out. Likewise, only certain kinds of wood were traditionally used, but later records show that many kinds of flammable material were burnt. It is suggested that the fires were a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic – they mimicked the Sun, helping the [...] "powers of growth" [...] and holding back the decay and darkness of winter. They may also have served to symbolically [...] "burn up and destroy all harmful influences". Accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that the fires (as well as their smoke and ashes) were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers. In Moray, boys asked for bonfire fuel from each house in the village. When the fire was lit, [...] "one after another of the youths laid himself down on the ground as near to the fire as possible {{so as not to be}} burned, and in such a position as to let the smoke roll over him. The others ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> and jumped over him". When the bonfire burnt down, they scattered the ashes, vying with each other who should scatter them most. Sometimes, two bonfires would be built side by side, and the people – sometimes with their livestock – would walk between them as a cleansing ritual. The bones of slaughtered cattle were said to have been cast upon bonfires. In the pre-Christian Gaelic world, cattle were the main form of wealth and were the center of agricultural and pastoral life.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 September, {{a platoon}} of ELAS fighters ambushed a {{government}} water supply column outside Chortiatis, killing a single driver and gravely injuring his passenger. Half an hour later a second car came under fire on the same location. One German soldier was wounded and taken prisoner along with two Greek workers, whilst the Greek driver and a second soldier managed to flee to Asvestochori. When the denizens of Chortiatis expressed their fears regarding a potential German reprisal towards Antonis Kazakos (the head of the ELAS platoon), he appeared dismissive, exclaiming [...] "This area {{is part of a}} free Greece. No German will dare to step his foot into this land". Shortly afterwards a Wehrmacht patrol spotted a burning car outside Chortiatis, confirming that an attack had taken place. Kazakos convinced the civilian population of Chortiatis to remain in place, but unbeknownst to him 20 cars loaded with German and Schubert's soldiers were already on their way towards the village. The ELAS band and its captives departed to Livadi, whilst the local men left the village for the surrounding fields even earlier. Upon surrounding the village, the Germans assembled the remaining women and children at the village square, while a second group was taken to the local cafe. When the village mayor Christos Batatsiou attempted to beg the Germans for mercy he was stabbed with a knife by Schubert and taken away by his men, who proceeded to loot and burn 300 houses. The women and children from the square were then forced into the house of Evangelos Davoudis where they were burned alive, only two of them managing to survive. Schubert's men led the second group of civilians into the bakery of Stefanos Gouramanis while one of them played a violin and others sung cheerfully. A machine gun was placed in one of the bakery's windows, gunning down those standing inside. Eight children managed to escape the carnage by climbing out of a small window {{in the back of the}} building.
