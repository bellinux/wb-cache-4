5|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may {{reduce the risk of}} post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than <b>thrombolysis,</b> but patients may choose <b>thrombolysis</b> if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure. NICE recommends that <b>thrombolysis</b> is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. <b>Thrombolysis</b> is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that <b>thrombolysis</b> is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{three large}} {{randomized}} controlled trials—the Norwegian CaVent trial, the North American ATTRACT trial, and the Dutch CAVA trial—are studying the effectiveness {{and safety of}} catheter-directed <b>thrombolysis.</b> In 2012, two studies found a clinical benefit in taking aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thrombolysis,</b> stenting {{and surgery}} {{are not used}} as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} <b>thrombolysis</b> (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities {{have been reported in}} the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, <b>thrombolysis</b> (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical clot {{retrieval}} and catheter-guided <b>thrombolysis</b> {{are used}} in certain situations.|$|E
25|$|An ECG {{that reveals}} ST segment {{elevation}} or new left bundle branch block suggests complete blockage {{of one of}} the main coronary arteries. These patients require immediate reperfusion (re-opening) of the occluded vessel. This can be achieved in two ways: <b>thrombolysis</b> (clot-busting medication) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Both of these are effective in reducing significantly the mortality of myocardial infarction. Many centers are now moving to the use of PTCA as it is somewhat more effective than <b>thrombolysis</b> if it can be administered early. This may involve transfer to a nearby facility with facilities for angioplasty.|$|E
25|$|Catheter-directed <b>thrombolysis</b> (CDT) {{is a new}} {{technique}} found to be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using fluoroscopic imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary embolus. CDT is performed by interventional radiologists, and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment. Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted <b>thrombolysis</b> is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>thrombolysis</b> in non-massive PEs {{is still}} debated. Some {{have found that}} the {{treatment}} decreases the risk of death and increases the risk of bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage. Others have found no decrease in the risk of death.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} this {{qualification}} is to build upon the Paramedics' knowledge and skillset to deliver advanced resuscitation interventions such as intubation, rapid sequence induction, chest decompression, <b>thrombolysis</b> and pacing as well as developing more advanced capability in clinical leadership and decision-making.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> is the {{pharmacological}} {{destruction of}} blood clots by administering thrombolytic drugs including recombitant tissue plasminogen activator, which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body's enzymes. This carries {{an increased risk}} of bleeding so is generally only used for specific situations (such as severe stroke or a massive pulmonary embolism).|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombolysis,</b> such as with {{recombinant}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability. It does not, however, improve chances of survival. Benefit is greater the earlier it is used. Between three and {{four and a half}} hours the effects are less clear. A 2014 review found a 5% {{increase in the number of}} people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term. After four and a half hours <b>thrombolysis</b> worsens outcomes. These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated. There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke may improve {{outcomes}} if done within 7 hours of the start of symptoms in those with an anterior circulation large artery clot. It however {{does not change the}} risk of death. Significant complications occur in about 7%. Intravenous <b>thrombolysis</b> is generally used in eligible people even if they are being considered for mechanical thrombectomy.|$|E
25|$|Aspirin {{reduces the}} overall risk of {{recurrence}} by 13% with greater benefit early on. Definitive therapy {{within the first}} few hours is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (<b>thrombolysis),</b> or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy). The philosophical premise underlying the importance of rapid stroke intervention was summed up as Time is Brain! in the early 1990s. Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified.|$|E
25|$|Massive PE causing hemodynamic {{instability}} (shock and/or low blood pressure, {{defined as}} a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a pressure drop of 40 mmHg for >15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia or sepsis) is an indication for <b>thrombolysis,</b> the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. In this situation, {{it is the best}} available treatment in those without contraindications and is supported by clinical guidelines. It is also recommended in those in cardiac arrest with a known PE.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} PE include {{beginning}} {{to move as}} soon as possible after surgery, lower leg exercises during periods of sitting, and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery. Treatment is typically with blood thinners such as heparin or warfarin. Often these are recommended for six months or longer. Severe cases may require <b>thrombolysis</b> using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy. If blood thinners are not appropriate, a vena cava filter may be used.|$|E
25|$|In {{massive and}} submassive PE, {{dysfunction}} {{of the right}} side of the heart may be seen on echocardiography, an indication that the pulmonary artery is severely obstructed and the right ventricle, a low-pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure. Some studies (see below) suggest that this finding may be an indication for <b>thrombolysis.</b> Not every person with a (suspected) pulmonary embolism requires an echocardiogram, but elevations in cardiac troponins or brain natriuretic peptide may indicate heart strain and warrant an echocardiogram, and be important in prognosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the setting}} of acute chest pain, the {{electrocardiogram}} is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the ST segment, new left bundle branch block), treatment for {{a heart attack in}} the form of angioplasty or <b>thrombolysis</b> is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, {{it is not possible to}} immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI.|$|E
25|$|Bruce {{developed}} an early {{interest in the}} use of computers in cardiology and established a computer laboratory in the Division of Cardiology. He devised a method for quantifying the QRS and ST segments in the EKG during exercise. In the late 1950s, he {{was also one of the}} first to suggest the possible benefit of <b>thrombolysis</b> in acute myocardial infarction. Bruce published more than 300 scientific articles, a major contribution to knowledge of cardiovascular physiology in health and disease. He was a founding member of the Association of University Cardiologists and its second president, in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Reperfusion {{therapy is}} a medical {{treatment}} to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked arteries, typically {{after a heart attack}} (myocardial infarction) (MI). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called <b>thrombolysis.</b> Surgeries performed may be minimally-invasive endovascular procedures such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a coronary angioplasty. The angioplasty uses the insertion of a balloon to open up the artery, with the possible additional use of one or more stents. Other surgeries performed are the more invasive bypass surgeries that graft arteries around blockages.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in <b>thrombolysis</b> or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|BTech/BEMC or The bachelor's degree Technology or bachelor's {{degree in}} Emergency Medical Care - This is a {{four-year}} professional degree, {{and students who}} complete this degree are eligible to be registered with the HPCSA as Emergency Care Practitioner (ECP), which has an additional scope of practice over the Critical Care Assistant and the National Diploma qualifications. The two additions in stand-alone capabilities are <b>Thrombolysis</b> and Rapid sequence induction. ECPs are also trained in the rescue disciplines offered by their institutions, normally up {{to the level of}} Advanced Rescue Practitioner. Example: High Angle II, Motor Vehicle, Fire Search and Rescue, Aviation, Confined Space, Structural Collapse, Industrial and Agricultural, Trench, Aquatic Rescue, etc. The advantage of the Btech qualification {{is that it is a}} university qualification that is consistent with the international industry trend.|$|E
25|$|Its use is {{endorsed}} by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms {{as long as there}} are not other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours <b>thrombolysis</b> improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality. Additionally, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine states that objective evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke is insufficient to warrant its classification as standard of care. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> (removal of {{the blood}} clot with [...] "clot buster" [...] medication) has been described, either systemically by {{injection}} into a vein or directly into the clot during angiography. The 2006 European Federation of Neurological Societies guideline recommends that <b>thrombolysis</b> is only used in patients who deteriorate despite adequate treatment, and other causes of deterioration have been eliminated. It is unclear which drug and which mode of administration is the most effective. Bleeding into the brain and in other sites {{of the body is}} a major concern in the use of <b>thrombolysis.</b> American guidelines make no recommendation with regards to <b>thrombolysis,</b> stating that more research is needed.|$|E
500|$|Treatment of an MI is time critical. Aspirin is an {{appropriate}} immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids {{may be used to}} help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart, and include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented, or <b>thrombolysis,</b> where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. [...] After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.|$|E
2500|$|Unique {{properties}} of the sol-gel provide the possibility of their use {{for a variety of}} medical applications. A sol–gel processed alumina {{can be used as a}} carrier for the sustained delivery of drugs and as an established wound healer. A marked decrease in scar size [...] because of the wound healing composite including sol–gel processed alumina. A [...] to <b>thrombolysis</b> treatment is possible by developing a new family of injectable composites: plasminogen activator entrapped within alumina.|$|E
2500|$|Thrombolytic {{therapy is}} {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of STEMI – if it can begin within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, and the person is eligible based on exclusion criteria, and a coronary angioplasty is not immediately available. <b>Thrombolysis</b> is most effective in the first 2 hours. After 12 hours, the risk of [...] intracranial bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy outweighs any benefit. Because irreversible injury occurs within 2–4 hours of the infarction, there is a limited window of time available for reperfusion to work.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency {{bypass surgery}} for the {{treatment}} of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is less common than PCI or <b>thrombolysis.</b> From 1995 to 2004, the percentage of people with cardiogenic shock treated with primary PCI rose from 27.4% to 54.4%, while the increase in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was only from 2.1% to 3.2%. [...] Emergency CABG is usually undertaken to simultaneously treat a mechanical complication, such as a ruptured papillary muscle, or a ventricular septal defect, with ensuing cardiogenic shock. In uncomplicated MI, the mortality rate can be high when the surgery is performed immediately following the infarction. If this option is entertained, the patient should be stabilized prior to surgery, with supportive interventions {{such as the use of}} an intra-aortic balloon pump. In patients developing cardiogenic shock after a myocardial infarction, both PCI and CABG are satisfactory treatment options, with similar survival rates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{benefit of}} prompt, [...] primary {{angioplasty}} over thrombolytic therapy for acute STEMI is now well established. When performed rapidly, an angioplasty restores {{flow in the}} blocked artery in more than 95% of patients compared with the reperfusion rate of about 65% achieved by <b>thrombolysis.</b> Logistic and economic obstacles seem to hinder a more widespread application of angioplasty, although the feasibility of providing regionalized angioplasty for STEMI is currently being explored in the United States. The use of a coronary angioplasty to abort a myocardial infarction is preceded by a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The goal of a prompt angioplasty is to open the artery as soon as possible, and preferably within 90 minutes of the patient presenting to the emergency room. This time {{is referred to as}} the door-to-balloon time. Few hospitals can provide an angioplasty within the 90 minute interval, which prompted the American College of Cardiology (ACC) to launch a national Door to Balloon (D2B) Initiative in November 2006. Over 800 hospitals have joined the D2B Alliance as of March 16, 2007.|$|E
2500|$|If the ECG {{confirms}} changes {{suggestive of}} myocardial infarction (ST elevations in specific leads, a new left bundle branch block or a true posterior MI pattern), thrombolytics may be administered or primary coronary angioplasty may be performed. In the former, medication is injected that stimulates fibrinolysis, destroying blood clots obstructing the coronary arteries. In the latter, a flexible catheter is passed via the femoral or radial arteries and {{advanced to the}} heart to identify blockages in the coronaries. When occlusions are found, they can be intervened upon mechanically with angioplasty and usually stent deployment if a lesion, termed the culprit lesion, {{is thought to be}} causing myocardial damage. [...] Data suggest that rapid triage, transfer and treatment is essential. The time frame for door-to-needle thrombolytic administration according to American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines should be within 30 minutes, whereas the door-to-balloon Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) time should be less than 90 minutes. [...] It was found that <b>thrombolysis</b> {{is more likely to be}} delivered within the established ACC guidelines among patients with STEMI as compared to PCI according to a case control study.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> {{is usually}} intravenous. It {{may also be}} used {{directly}} into the affected blood vessel during an angiogram (intra-arterial <b>thrombolysis),</b> e.g. when patients present with stroke beyond three hours or in severe deep vein thrombosis (catheter-directed <b>thrombolysis).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> is {{performed}} by {{many types of}} medical specialists, including interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, cardiologists, interventional neuroradiologists, and neurosurgeons. In some countries such as the United States of America, emergency medical technicians may administer thrombolytics for heart attacks in prehospital settings, by on-line medical direction. In countries with more extensive and independent qualifications, prehospital <b>thrombolysis</b> (fibrinolysis) may be initiated by the emergency care practitioner (ECP). Other countries which employ ECP's include, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Prehospital <b>thrombolysis</b> is always {{the result of a}} risk-benefit calculation of the heart attack, <b>thrombolysis</b> risks, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) availability.|$|E
50|$|The main {{complication}} is bleeding (which can be dangerous), and in {{some situations}} <b>thrombolysis</b> may therefore be unsuitable. <b>Thrombolysis</b> can also play {{an important part in}} reperfusion therapy that deals specifically with blocked arteries.|$|E
50|$|If PCI {{cannot be}} {{performed}} within 90 to 120 minutes in STEMI then fibrinolysis, preferably within 30 minutes of arrival to hospital, is recommended. If {{a person has}} had symptoms for 12 to 24 hours evidence for effectiveness of <b>thrombolysis</b> is less {{and if they have}} had symptoms for more than 24 hours it is not recommended. <b>Thrombolysis</b> involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally dissolve blood clots. These medications include tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, streptokinase, and tenecteplase. <b>Thrombolysis</b> is not recommended in a number of situations, particularly when associated with a high risk of bleeding or the potential for problematic bleeding, such as active bleeding, past strokes or bleeds into the brain, or severe hypertension. Situations in which <b>thrombolysis</b> may be considered, but with caution, include recent surgery, use of anticoagulants, pregnancy, and proclivity to bleeding. Major risks of <b>thrombolysis</b> are major bleeding and intracranial bleeding. Pre-hospital <b>thrombolysis</b> reduces time to thrombolytic treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries, however it is unclear whether this has an impact on mortality rates.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thrombolysis</b> (removal of {{the blood}} clot with [...] "clot buster" [...] medication) has been described, either systemically by {{injection}} into a vein or directly into the clot during angiography.
