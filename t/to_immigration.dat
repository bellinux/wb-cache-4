5|$|Especially {{since the}} 1950s, {{religions}} {{from the former}} British colonies have grown in numbers, due <b>to</b> <b>immigration.</b> Islam {{is the most common}} of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England. Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined, introduced from India and South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Switzerland's {{population}} slightly exceeded eight million. In {{common with}} other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990. Growth has since stabilised, {{and like most}} of Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> and a fertility rate close to replacement level.|$|E
50|$|Latin America. Some {{countries}} in Latin America are considered Western countries, largely {{because most of}} its peoples are descended from Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese settlers and later immigration from other European nations). And thus their society operates in a highly Westernized way. Indeed, most {{countries in}} Latin America use their official language, either in Spanish or Portuguese. According to the CIA World Factbook, {{there has also been}} considerable <b>immigration</b> <b>to</b> Latin America from European nations other than Spain and Portugal (for example, from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, etc.—see <b>Immigration</b> <b>to</b> Argentina, <b>Immigration</b> <b>to</b> Brazil, <b>Immigration</b> <b>to</b> Uruguay or <b>Immigration</b> <b>to</b> Chile).|$|R

5|$|The 1963 census {{indicated}} that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of local indigenous congregations. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 {{in the number}} of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs, compared with 20%; and only a modest (6%) drop of Muslims which can likely be attributed <b>to</b> <b>immigration,</b> emigration, and birthrate.|$|E
5|$|Largely due <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish {{population}} of Zagreb quickly grew in size: from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, {{and then to}} 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue became too small to accommodate {{the needs of the}} ever-growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken {{to increase the number of}} available seats. A 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned. A central heating system was installed in 1933.|$|E

In February 16, 2007 a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.|$|E

5|$|Other {{people from}} much further afield {{in the former}} British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% {{of people living in}} England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent, mostly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 2.90% of the {{population}} are black, from Africa and the Caribbean, especially former British colonies. There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families, and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due <b>to</b> <b>immigration.</b> Debate over immigration is politically prominent; according to a 2009 Home Office poll, 80% of people want to cap it.

5|$|Political {{boundaries}} {{drawn by}} the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark {{in the form of}} divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of Indians emigrating {{to other parts of the}} empire, such as Malaysia and Fiji, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean. The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> to Britain from its former colonies.|$|E
5|$|Prosecution of {{the conspirators}} began in 1990, when {{a federal grand}} jury brought indictments against several of the key players. Some had fled the country, and {{extradition}} proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years. The final conspirator was convicted in 2006, when Catherine Jane Stork agreed to return to the United States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia. Eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. Rajneesh was never prosecuted in relation to the conspiracy, and left the United States after pleading guilty <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> fraud and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the U.S. Attorney General.|$|E

She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} {{study by the}} French historian Bernard B. Fall determined that the US Navy transported around 310,000refugees. The French were credited with around 214,000airlifted refugees, 270,000seaborne refugees and 120,000 and 80,000 Vietnamese and French military evacuees respectively. During the US Navy voyages, 54 people died on board, and 111 babies were born. Fall believed that of the 109,000refugees who went south by their own means, a large number hitchhiked on southbound French transport vessels that were {{not related to the}} migration operation. Fall felt that the figures were likely to have been overestimated, due <b>to</b> <b>immigration</b> fraud. Some refugees would travel south and register themselves, before smuggling themselves onto vessels returning north for another shipment of humans. They would then return south and re-register to claim another aid package. Likewise, with instances of entire villages moving south, the authorities frequently did not explicitly count the number of villagers, but simply took the word of the village leaders. The chiefs would often inflate the population figures to claim more aid rations. The mass exodus did not disrupt the north largely because whole villages often emigrated, instead of half a village moving and leaving the remainder of the community in disarray. Fall estimated that around 120,000Viet Minh troops and their dependents went north. Most of these evacuations were attributed to Viet Minh military strategy, with some being ordered to stay behind in readiness for future guerrilla activities. The northward movement was facilitated by vessels leaving from assembly areas at Qui Nhơn and Cà Mau at the southernmost extremity of Vietnam. The voyages to North Vietnam were provided by empty French ships heading back north to fetch more southbound anti-communists, as well vessels from communist nations such as Poland. The Viet Minh also actively cultivated the Montagnard indigenous people of Vietnam, whose land in the Central Highlands was encroached upon by incoming northern settlers. The communists spread propaganda through broadcasts in tribal languages and infiltrated the highland areas. According {{to a study by the}} Michigan State University Group, some 6,000tribespeople went north with the communists, accompanied by some Viet Minh who had adopted the indigenous culture.|$|E
