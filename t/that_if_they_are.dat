5|$|Since 1990, the Tower of London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2016.|$|E

25|$|English nouns are inflected for {{grammatical}} number, meaning <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> of the countable type, {{they generally}} have different forms for singular and plural. This article discusses {{the variety of}} ways in which English plural nouns are formed from the corresponding singular forms, as well as various issues concerning the usage of singulars and plurals in English. For plurals of pronouns, see English personal pronouns.|$|E
25|$|Another approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a {{resolver}} is {{to include}} the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as http://doi.org/ (preferred) or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can {{be included in a}} reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.|$|E

25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so much}} about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E
25|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have stated that}} the superiority of a husband over his wife is relative, and the obedience of the wife is also restrictive. The Quran advises men <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> certain of a rebellious attitude by the woman, they should first admonish her, then refuse to share beds, and finally beat ("darab") her, according to Qur'an 4:34. (Today most Islamic scholars agree that it be without leaving a mark {{and not on the}} face). This refers to serious breaches of behaviour such as being promiscuous according to renowned 20th-century scholar Muhammad Hamidullah which is not expected from a dutiful wife, and not for simple disobedience to the husband. In explaining this, Ibn Abbas gives an example of striking with a toothstick.|$|E
25|$|For {{search engine}} {{optimization}} purposes, some companies offer to sell high PageRank links to webmasters. As links from higher-PR pages {{are believed to}} be more valuable, they tend to be more expensive. It can be an effective and viable marketing strategy to buy link advertisements on content pages of quality and relevant sites to drive traffic and increase a webmaster's link popularity. However, Google has publicly warned webmasters <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> or were discovered to be selling links for the purpose of conferring PageRank and reputation, their links will be devalued (ignored in the calculation of other pages' PageRanks). The practice of buying and selling links is intensely debated across the Webmaster community. Google advises webmasters to use the nofollow HTML attribute value on sponsored links. According to Matt Cutts, Google is concerned about webmasters who try to game the system, and thereby reduce the quality and relevance of Google search results.|$|E

500|$|Speculation by [...] "people who {{profess to}} believe that these test matches will not be played at all, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and a First Division team is knocked out, the rules will be {{circumvented}} in some way" [...] proved unfounded. The League's Annual General Meeting heard proposals that the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams. Both motions were seconded by Small Heath – not surprisingly, after they as champions had failed to gain promotion while the teams in second and third place had succeeded – but both were defeated, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893–94 season. Small Heath were to finish that season as runners-up and, this time, achieved promotion to the First Division via the test matches.|$|E
500|$|Specialized {{molecular}} dynamics programs, {{referred to as}} [...] "FahCores" [...] and often abbreviated [...] "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a background process. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on GROMACS, {{one of the fastest}} and most popular {{molecular dynamics}} software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations. Although GROMACS is open-source software and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a closed-source license to help ensure data validity. Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used AMBER, CPMD, Desmond, and TINKER, but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service. Some of these cores perform explicit solvation calculations in which the surrounding solvent (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform implicit solvation methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum. The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation checkpoints so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.|$|E
500|$|Using John Wisdom's {{parable of}} the {{invisible}} gardener, Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable {{tells the story of}} two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected. Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a [...] "death by a thousand qualifications" [...] as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful. Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Abrams to promote 10 Cloverfield Lane, he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing Cloverfield 2, but the release of movies such as Godzilla and Pacific Rim led them to abandon them as they found the concept of Kaiju movies played out. However, Abrams also suggested that he has thought of something <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{lucky enough to get}} it made [...] "could be really cool that [...] connects some stories" [...] in a future film, even teasing a larger Cloverfield universe. Interviews with Dan Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, director and actress of 10 Cloverfield Lane, respectively, confirm that the movie is, and always was intended to be, an expansion of the first film, with Trachtenberg calling it the [...] "Cloververse".|$|E
