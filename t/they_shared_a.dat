5|$|Because of Bangladesh's meagre batting performance, the Australian innings began {{before lunch}} and opener Adam Gilchrist scored a {{typically}} quick-fire 18 {{before he was}} caught behind from Mortaza. Hayden (46) and Ponting then got valuable batting practice as <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> 74-run partnership. Ponting was eventually bowled by Rafique for 29. Damien Martyn's stay at the crease was cut short, in his first International match since breaking his finger in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he faced just one ball before Australia won by eight wickets with more than 27 overs to spare. Along with the wicket of Ponting, Rafique conceded just seven runs in five overs.|$|E
5|$|Watkin {{continued}} to harbour ambitions of linking his railway {{companies in the}} north and south of England, and while the construction of the Rickmansworth extension was underway planned two possible routes north from Rickmansworth across the Chilterns. One proposal envisaged the MR taking over or reaching agreement with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, building a link between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury, and running over the A's line to the north. The A had close relations with the Great Western Railway, with whom <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> station at Aylesbury. Watkin felt it possible that the A would reach agreement with the GWR instead and not cooperate with the MR.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E

5|$|The first large Maya cities {{developed}} in the Petén Basin in the far south of the Yucatán Peninsula {{as far back as}} the Middle Preclassic (c.600–350BC), and Petén formed the heartland of the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period (c.AD250–900). The 16th century Maya provinces of northern Yucatán are likely to have evolved out of polities of the Maya Classic period. From the mid-13th century AD through to the mid-15th century, the League of Mayapán united several of the northern provinces; for a time <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> joint form of government. The great cities that dominated Petén had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse. A significant Maya presence remained in Petén into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E
5|$|Although Višeslav is only {{mentioned}} by name, the DAI mentions that the Serbs served the Byzantine Emperor, {{and that they}} were at this time at peace with the Bulgars, their neighbours with whom <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> common frontier. The Bulgars, under Telerig, planned to colonize Bulgaria with Slavs from the neighbouring Berziti, as the earlier Bulgar expansion had caused massive Slav migrations and depopulation of Bulgaria when, in 762, more than 200,000 people fled to Byzantine territory and were relocated to Asia Minor. The Bulgars were defeated in 774, after Emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) learned of their planned raid. The Bulgars had by 773 cut off the communication route, the Vardar valley, between Serbia and the Byzantines. In 783, a large Slavic uprising took place in the Byzantine Empire, stretching from Macedonia to the Peloponnese, which was subsequently quelled by Byzantine patrikios Staurakios. In Pannonia, to the north of Serbia, Frankish ruler Charlemagne (r. 768–814) started his offensive against the Avars. Dalmatia, at this time, had firm relations with Byzantium. There was a Byzantine–Frankish conflict in the period of 789–810 over Dalmatia, although nothing is known from contemporary sources about the Slavs in the hinterland. When the general Byzantine–Frankish conflict ended in 812, the Franks held the Dalmatian coast while the Byzantines held the Dalmatian cities.|$|E

5|$|Ewelina {{had three}} brothers: Adam, Ernest and Henryk, and three sisters: Alina, Karolina (better known as Karolina Sobańska) and Paulina. Hańska was closest {{to her brother}} Henryk, who later became famous {{for his work in}} the genre of Polish folk {{literature}} known as gawęda. <b>They</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> passion for philosophical discussions, especially related to love and religion. Hańska's other brothers, Adam and Ernest, both pursued military careers. Hańska's eldest sister, Karolina, was admired as a child for her beauty, intellect, and musical talent. She later married a man 34 years her senior, a landowner from Podolie named Hieronim Sobański. They separated after two years, and she began a series of passionate affairs with some of her many suitors. These included the Russian general Ivan Ossipovitch Witt, the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, and the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin. The Tsar considered her behavior scandalous and declared her dangerously disloyal. As a result, Hańska and the other Rzewuski women were watched carefully by police when they visited the Russian capital of St Petersburg. Hańska's younger sisters, Alina and Paulina, married early into comfortable upper-class families. Alina married a wealthy landowner from Smilavichy, whose father had gained his fortune by managing property for the Ogiński family. Her nephew Stanisław Moniuszko became a renowned composer. Paulina married a banker from Odessa named Jan Riznič.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. The cricketing conditions were challenging: matches were played on matting pitches, unfamiliar to English players, and the South African googly bowlers had previously troubled most leading English batsmen, provoking debate over how batsmen could combat the new delivery. The MCC captain, Leveson Gower, selected Wilfred Rhodes to open the batting with Hobbs for the first Test. Rhodes, a defensively-minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles, had begun {{his career as a}} bowler who batted down the order. He steadily improved his batting, eventually becoming an opening batsman. Hobbs and Rhodes, between 1910 and 1921, opened the batting 36 times for England and shared eight century partnerships; their average of 61.31 runs per opening partnership remains the second highest in Test history. In other first-class cricket, <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> further five century opening partnerships. Their association was notable for effective running; the pair developed such an unusually good understanding {{that they were able to}} run without calling to each other. They scored singles by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly. Critics believed that they raised the art of running to a new level.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point of conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} Mekong Delta landowner, Thơ rose through the ranks as a {{low-profile}} provincial chief under French colonial rule, and he was briefly imprisoned by Imperial Japan when they invaded and deposed the French during World War II. During this time he met Minh {{for the first time}} as <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> cell. Following World War II, he became the Interior Minister in the French-backed State of Vietnam, an associated state in the French Union. After the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam following the partition, Thơ was sent to Japan as ambassador and secured war reparations. Recalled to Vietnam within a year, he helped to dismantle the private armies of the Hòa Hảo religious sect in the mid-1950s. Tho led the political efforts to weaken the Hòa Hảo leadership. While Minh led the military effort, Thơ tried to buy off Hòa Hảo leaders. One commander, Ba Cụt, was personally hostile to Thơ, whose father had confiscated the land of Ba Cụt's family decades earlier. The stand-off could not be ended peacefully in this case, and Ba Cụt was captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually pulls himself together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and take it from there. The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets comfort from Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> <b>a</b> kiss, they realise {{that they are not}} right for each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised by the arrival of her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds a new place to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E
