40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{in order to understand}} the effects and perceptions of trash—unwanted, spoiled, or improperly discarded items. An exploratory correlational study investigated people’s attitudes <b>and</b> knowledge about <b>trash</b> <b>and</b> recycling, finding that participants lack knowledge about certain key recycling behaviors. Politically liberal individuals had more negative attitudes towards <b>trash</b> <b>and</b> positive attitudes towards recycling compared with politically conservative individuals. A laboratory study examined the effects of <b>trash</b> <b>and</b> disorder on behavior. Contrary to expectations, no statistically significant differences between conditions were found on creativity, donation to charity, or cheating. Participants in the orderly condition scored significantly higher on verbal GRE questions than those in the disorderly condition, but those in the trash-filled room did not score significantly different from either of the other two conditions on the GRE questions. The set of studies have important implications for <b>trash</b> <b>and</b> recycling policy, and bring further nuance into the discussion on the consequences of <b>trash</b> <b>and</b> disorder...|$|R
50|$|CFK {{was founded}} by Rye Barcott (then an {{undergraduate}} at UNC) to help prevent ethnic and religious violence in Kibera through a community-based sports program. In the summer of 2001, Barcott teamed up with Salim Mohamed who was managing the Information and Management Department of the Mathare Youth Sports Association in another informal settlement in Nairobi. Barcott also reunited with the late Tabitha Atieno Festo, a registered nurse and resident of Kibera who had established a small medical clinic from a grant of $26 that Barcott had given her the previous summer to sell vegetables. CFK received its initial funding from hundreds of American citizens {{in addition to a}} $30,000 start-up grant from the Ford Foundation. A year later, two undergraduates from the United States, Karen Austrian and Emily Verellen, volunteered in Kibera with CFK and helped young women in Kibera create CFK’s third program, The Binti Pamoja (Daughters United) Center, establishing a safe space for young girls to address issues unique to them. Youth in Kibera subsequently developed the Taka ni Pato (<b>Trash</b> is <b>Cash)</b> <b>and</b> Base of the Pyramid programs in 2005 in order to address the dearth of employment opportunities in Kibera.|$|R
