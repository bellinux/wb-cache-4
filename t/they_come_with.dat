500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E

Field said {{the main reason}} {{she felt she had}} to be in the film was because of {{producer}} Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have." [...] Webb said that while [...] "we all love Aunt May", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. [...] "He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment? That can create some tension, but you want there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerned for his health, Irving's {{brothers}} financed {{an extended}} tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. Irving bypassed {{most of the}} sites and locations considered essential {{for the development of}} an upwardly mobile young man, to the dismay of his brother William. William wrote that, though he was pleased his brother's health was improving, he did not like the choice to [...] "gallop through Italy... leaving Florence on your left and Venice on your right". Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that would later make him one of the world's most in-demand guests. [...] "I endeavor to take things as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> cheerfulness", Irving wrote, [...] "and when I cannot get a dinner to suit my taste, I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner". While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with the American painter Washington Allston and nearly allowed himself to be persuaded into following Allston into a career as a painter. [...] "My lot in life, however", Irving said later, [...] "was differently cast".|$|E
