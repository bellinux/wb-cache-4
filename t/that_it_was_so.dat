The squadron was re-designated as an Attack squadron and received a Boeing GA-1 bi-motored tri-plane.

25|$|During {{his review}} of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Kermode made a passing comment <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> similar to the Harry Potter {{franchise}} {{it might as well}} be called 'Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins'. Listener Jeremy Dylan then took this title and produced posters, a trailer and, eventually, an independent film based on the concept, with Stephen Fry as narrator. Following the basic structure of the Harry Potter books, where the main character discovers special abilities and goes to a special school, the script contains a multitude of references to Wittertainment jokes and themes.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration. One account even says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> bad that ketchup from {{uncapped}} bottles would shoot {{up from the}} table in the small dining room. Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new steel deck and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to the top deck and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E
25|$|During Edward II's reign (1307–1327) {{the land}} was under the {{possession}} of John de Apeton and the first attempts were made at managing {{the effects of the}} sea with rudimentary defences, but periodical flooding continued to blight the small population of mostly shepherds and their fat-tailed variety of sheep for a further 300 years. William Camden wrote of the island in 1607 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> low that it was often quite flooded, except the hills, upon which the sheep have a place of safe refuge. The uniform flatness of Canvey suggests that these hills are likely to be the red hills of the Roman salt making industry, or the early makeshift sea defences constructed by some of the landowners around their farms.|$|E

500|$|Garfield had not {{actually}} written a speech, and {{was nervous about}} speaking in front of such a large crowd. Before heading to Chicago, Sherman told Garfield that Garfield's speech should stress Sherman's [...] "courageous persistence in any course he had adopted." [...] Garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride {{for his role in}} the convention. Garfield then listed the qualities that a president should possess and stressed the importance of party unity. [...] It wasn't until near his conclusion that he mentioned Sherman by name. Many reports of Garfield's speech describe it as enthusiastic, eloquent, and well received. Some accounts indicate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> well-received that it caused delegates to begin thinking of Garfield as a contender for the presidential nomination.|$|E

500|$|Ornstein soon {{moved in}} a very {{different}} direction. He began imagining and then writing works with new sounds, dissonant and startling. Ornstein himself was unsettled by the earliest of these compositions: [...] "I really doubted my sanity at first. I simply said, what is <b>that?</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> completely removed from any experience I ever had." [...] On March 27, 1914, in London, he gave his first public performance of works then called [...] "futurist", now known as modernist. In addition to a Busoni arrangement of three Bach choral preludes and several pieces by Schoenberg, Ornstein played a number of his own compositions. The concert caused a major stir. One newspaper described Ornstein's work as [...] "the sum of Schoenberg and Scriabine [...] squared." [...] Others were less analytical: [...] "We have never suffered from such insufferable hideousness, expressed in terms of so-called music." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!"

500|$|There {{was some}} puzzlement {{expressed}} by several reviewers, including Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Votta, {{as to why}} Finn would think Sam {{had been such a}} great performer to begin with <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> important to bring him back. Despite that, Votta was pleased by Sam's return as was Bell, who thought {{it was one of the}} more enjoyable aspects of the episode. Sam's scene with Blaine, however, was met with criticism, but of Blaine's characterization, not Sam's: BuddyTV John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine [...] "essentially calls Sam a whore" [...] and that [...] "he's like a completely different person". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger described the scene as [...] "pretty out of character" [...] for Blaine, and The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot, including Finn's antagonism toward Blaine, was [...] "so sloppily assembled" [...] he was glad it was ended in the following scene. The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked on—West enjoyed it, but said she had been hoping for more.|$|E

500|$|Revising North American Oryzomys in 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman {{retained}} O.antillarum as {{a separate}} species, but conceded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> similar to mainland O.couesi {{that it may have}} been introduced on Jamaica. In 1920, Harold Anthony reported that remains of O.antillarum were common in coastal caves, suggesting that the species had previously been {{an important part of the}} diet of the barn owl (Tyto alba). In 1942, Glover Morrill Allen doubted that it was even a distinct species and in his 1962 Ph.D. thesis, Clayton Ray, who examined numerous cave specimens, agreed and retained it as only a [...] "weakly differentiated subspecies" [...] of Oryzomys palustris (which by then included O.couesi and other Mexican and Central American forms), Oryzomys palustris antillarum. Philip Hershkovitz came to the same conclusion in a 1966 paper. After O.couesi of Mexico and Central America was again classified as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) of the United States, the Jamaican form came to be regarded as a subspecies of the former, Oryzomys couesi antillarum.|$|E
500|$|Following its release, Mississippi Burning became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} over its fictionalization of events; it was heavily criticized by African-American activists {{who were involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the families of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner. Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., boycotted the film, stating, [...] "How long will we have to wait before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put their lives on the line for equality?" [...] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, [...] "It was unfortunate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember." [...] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, [...] "reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud" [...] and portrays African Americans as [...] "cowed, submissive and blank-faced".|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} other {{producers}} usually {{a majority of the}} track was already done {{by the time he got}} to the recording studio, but with West, the process was more creative in nature. Pusha described the recording process with West as a [...] "roller coast" [...] and stated that he never knew what to expect while working with the producer. Upon hearing the production of the song, Pusha-T commented <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good it persuaded him to write a particularly inspired verse. On the production of [...] "So Appalled", he said [...] "it's Kanye, the beat brings the ghost out of you." [...] The rapper described his verse as [...] "self-explanatory" [...] and stated that it was one of his favorite of his career. Pusha T called his verse [...] "his personal favorite" [...] and that the track was originally supposed to be just him and Kanye. When the song was finished, Pusha-T was so impressed with the track that he argued with West to include it on his album, stating that the song was so good it didn't matter whether or not it had leaked.

500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so.</b> No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} gave the episode mixed to {{negative}} reviews. Tom Ryan of WhatCulture rated the episode {{two and a}} half out of five stars, summing up the review with; [...] "Given the popularity of the original book and the success thus far of the current TV series, it is safe to assume that last nights episode was perhaps the most eagerly anticipated installment of the show since its inception. Too bad then <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> underwhelming." [...] The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; [...] "Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of {{the amount of time that}} Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in a huff after being subjected to another one of Sherlock's baroque [...] "that man is left-handed and also has dog hair on one of his socks" [...] monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there was none of the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock." [...] Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror stated that the episode was [...] "a disappointment," [...] adding that the contrasting reveal of the hound from the original book was [...] "a tedious treatise against vivisection." [...] However, Shelley stated that he enjoyed the [...] "mind palace" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|Not all of {{the recent}} {{critical}} reaction to Tenebrae has been positive. Geoff Andrew of Time Out thought that the film was [...] "unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards". John Kenneth Muir, author of Horror Films of the 1980s, considers the film to be far inferior to Suspiria, but acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> [...] "unremittingly gory" [...] that it justified its US title of [...] "Unsane". John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a [...] "technically mesmeric" [...] one, felt that thematically it was a [...] "disappointingly retrograde step" [...] for Argento. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com called it a [...] "gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick", while Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews dismissed it as [...] "trash", giving it the grade C. Gary Johnson, editor of Images, complained, [...] "Not much of Tenebre makes much sense. The plot becomes {{little more than an}} excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And {{these are some of the}} bloodiest murders of Argento's career." [...] In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, [...] "Tenebre is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors".|$|E
