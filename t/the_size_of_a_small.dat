40|$|When {{considering}} a graph problem from <b>a</b> parameterized point <b>of</b> view, the parameter chosen is often <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal solution <b>of</b> this problem (the "standard" parameter). A natural subject for investigation {{is what happens}} when we parameterize such a problem by various other parameters, some of which may be the values of optimal solutions to different problems. Such research is known as parameterized ecology. In this paper, we investigate seven natural vertex problems, along with their respective parameters: <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum independent set, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum vertex cover, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum clique, <b>the</b> chromatic number, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum dominating set, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum independent dominating set and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum feedback vertex set.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique using linear programming {{that may be}} used to analyse the worst-case performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> class <b>of</b> greedy heuristics for certain optimisation problems on regular graphs. We demonstrate the use of this technique on heuristics for bounding <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum maximal matching (MMM), a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) and a minimum independent dominating set (MIDS) in cubic graphs. As a result, we show that for n-vertex connected cubic graphs, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMM is at most 9 n/ 20 + O(1), <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MCDS is at most 3 n/ 4 + O(1) and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MIDS is at most 29 n/ 70 + O(1).

25|$|Three {{lineages}} within Equidae {{are believed}} to be descended from the numerous varieties of Merychippus: Hipparion, Protohippus and Pliohippus. The most different from Merychippus was Hipparion, mainly in the structure of tooth enamel: in comparison with other Equidae, the inside, or tongue side, had a completely isolated parapet. A complete and well-preserved skeleton of the North American Hipparion shows an animal <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pony. They were very slim, rather like antelopes, and were adapted to life on dry prairies. On its slim legs, Hipparion had three toes equipped with small hooves, but the side toes did not touch the ground.|$|E

25|$|The Miohippus {{population}} that {{remained on the}} steppes {{is believed to be}} ancestral to Parahippus, a North American animal about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pony, with a prolonged skull and a facial structure resembling the horses of today. Its third toe was stronger and larger, and carried the main weight of the body. Its four premolars resembled the molar teeth; the first were small and almost nonexistent. The incisor teeth, like those of its predecessors, had a crown (like human incisors); however, the top incisors had a trace of a shallow crease marking the beginning of the core/cup.|$|E
25|$|Exercise (Dunhuang) 2014 {{originated}} in satellite images {{that were the}} object of online discussion and speculation during 2011. The images show a mysterious structure {{in the heart of}} the Chinese desert, a precise system of roadways <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> town and apparently designed to be seen from orbit. Gerrard commissioned an American satellite imaging firm to depth-scan these markings, and visited the site to document it photographically, in order to digitally reconstruct the entire structure and its surrounding landscape. Into this simulation, the artist places motion-captured simulacra of thirty-nine workers from a Ghangzhou computer manufacturing plant, clothed in the blue uniforms and elasticated paper bonnets they wear for their work.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{encompasses}} many species-rich ecosystems for animals, fungi and plants, Brazil houses {{many thousands}} of species, with many (if not most) of them still undiscovered. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise {{of the country in}} the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its environmental habitats has increasingly come under threat. Extensive logging in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of plants and animals. However, as various species possess special characteristics, or are built in an interesting way, some of their capabilities are being copied for use in technology (see bionics), and the profit potential may result in a retardation of deforestation.|$|E

40|$|Network {{controllability}} is {{an important}} topic in wide-ranging research fields. However, the relationship between controllability and network structure is poorly understood, although degree heterogeneity is known to determine the controllability. We focus on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum dominating set (MDS), <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> network controllability, and investigate the effect of degree-degree correlation, which is universally observed in real-world networks, on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS. We show that disassortativity or negative degree-degree correlation reduces <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS using analytical treatments and numerical simulation, whereas positive correlations hardly affect <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDS. This result suggests that disassortativity enhances network controllability. Furthermore, apart from the controllability issue, the developed techniques provide new ways of analyzing complex networks with degreedegree correlations...|$|R
25|$|The rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum {{is almost}} <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rabbit. It is grey to reddish-grey in colour on the back, while its underside {{is a light}} cream colour. It has white hair patches underneath its small, round ears and both {{above and below the}} eyes. A mid-dorsal stripe runs from the crown of the head {{to the middle of the}} back. Like other possums, it has a prehensile tail, adapted for grasping especially by wrapping around. However, the tail is unique in its appearance compared to that of other possums as it is covered with fur only halfway down. Males are 33.4 to 37.5cm long while females are generally bigger and range from 34.9 to 38.3cm in length and weigh between 1,280 and 2,000grams. Another uncommon feature in the appearance of this species is that it has vertical pupils.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from hell that roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound is <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> horse and appears {{from the depths of}} Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is said not to harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was in the sitting room of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from the Bump.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Apple {{began to}} {{organize}} the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced Apple III or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979, Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers {{to be allowed to}} visit PARC to see the systems in action. The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond {{the state of the art}} for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a case which was <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 32-bit Motorola 68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs, and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs' continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.|$|E
