40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> history {{of at least one}} previous cesarean section and to compare the pregnancy outcome of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> history of one previous cesarean section to <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> history of two or more previous cesarean section. Material and Method: We performed a retrospective study of 458 patients undergoing repeated cesarean section from 1998 to 2005. Various factors that may be associated with repeated cesarean sections and pregnancy outcomes were assessed and analyzed. Results: Maternal morbidity rate was 18. 6 %, including operative complications (17. 5 %) and post operative complications (1. 7 %). The operative complications included intraperitoneal adhesion 45 cases (9. 8 %), ex-cessive blood loss (> 1000 ml) 29 cases (6. 3 %), placenta previa 5 cases (1. 1 %), placenta adherens 6 cases (1. 3 %) and requirement of blood transfusion 10 cases (2. 2 %). Postoperative complications included postpar-tum hemorrhage 4 cases (0. 9 %). No maternal mortality was found in this study. Neonatal morbidity rate was 20. 5 %, including neonatal jaundice 33 case (7. 2 %), large for gestational age 37 cases (8. 1 %), and preterm babies 20 cases (4. 4 %). There were no statistically significant differences of maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity between <b>the</b> pregnant <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> history of one previous cesarean section and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> history of two or more previous cesarean section. Conclusions: Maternal and neonatal morbidity in repeated cesarean section were low...|$|R

However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the front of the stage.

They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience.

In 51. 8 % the iris color was blue as the most prevalent color, and in 7. 1 % the color was brown as the least prevalent color.

25|$|Kumashiro {{also took}} breaks from the Roman Porno genre to direct {{mainstream}} films, beginning with Bitterness of Youth (1974), {{a story of}} student radicalism with similarities to Dreiser's An American Tragedy (1925). Other such films include Light of Africa (1975) for Toho and Jigoku (1979), a remake of Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 film Jigoku, for Toei. For the German-Japanese co-production, <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Red Hat (1982), Kumashiro worked with Pink Film producer-director Kōji Wakamatsu. The production was an unsuccessful attempt on Wakamatsu's part to emulate the success he had had in collaborating with the French in Nagisa Ōshima's In the Realm of the Senses (1976). The story, dealing with a Japanese man in Germany and his obsessive sexual relationship with a German woman during Hitler's rise to power, also seemed to echo Ōshima's film. Jasper Sharp notes with surprise that Kumashiro, who had long been an opponent of Japanese censorship, did {{not take advantage of}} the more liberal European laws.

Lola also {{narrowly}} misses the cyclist; the cyclist instead offers his bike to the homeless man in a restaurant, who uses Manni's money to buy it. Lola falls onto the bonnet of Mr. Meier's car, preventing his collision with the white BMW, allowing him to pick up Lola's dad on time. Since Lola can no longer speak to her dad, she continues running until she encounters a casino. Having only 99 marks, she convinces the cashier {{to give her a}} 100 mark chip. Betting the chip on a roulette table, she wins two consecutive bets, raising 126,000 marks. The people in the casino are shocked to see her win. Approaching the ambulance from behind, Lola climbs inside as it avoids the glass pane. Recognizing the patient inside as a security guard from the bank, Lola realizes he has suffered a heart attack. She holds his hand to calm him and, to the doctor's surprise, his heart rate immediately becomes normal.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} two gods at the kalendae {{of every}} month is that of {{presiding}} over {{the birth of the}} new moon. Janus and Juno cooperate as the first looks after the passage from the previous to the ensuing month while the second helps it through the strength of her vitality. The rites of the kalendae included the invocations to Juno Covella, giving the number of days to the nonae, a sacrifice to Janus by the rex sacrorum and the pontifex minor at the curia Calabra and one to Juno by the regina sacrorum in the Regia: originally when the month was still lunar the pontifex minor had the task of signalling the appearance of the new moon. While the meaning of the epithet Covella is unknown and debated, that of the rituals is clear as the divine couple is supposed to oversee, protect and help the moon during the particularly dangerous time of her darkness and her labours: the role of Juno Covella is hence {{the same as that of}} Lucina for women during parturition. The association of the two gods is reflected on the human level at the difficult time of labours as is apparent in the custom of putting a key, symbol of Janus, in the hand of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aim of ensuring an easy delivery, while she had to invoke Juno Lucina.

500|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Eva Perón {{had become the}} subject of {{numerous}} articles, books, stage plays, and musicals, ranging from the biography <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Whip to a 1981 TV movie called Evita Perón with Faye Dunaway {{in the title role}}. The most successful rendering of Eva Perón's life has been the musical production Evita. The musical began as a concept album co-produced by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1976, with Julie Covington in the title role. Elaine Paige was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in London's West End and won the 1978 Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical. In 1980, Patti LuPone won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as the title character in the Broadway production.

Fraser and Navarro, however, counter these claims, writing that Ramón Cereijo, Minister of Finance, kept records, and that the foundation [...] "began as the simplest response to the poverty (Evita) encountered each day in her office" [...] and [...] "the appalling backwardness of social services—or charity, as it was still called—in Argentina." [...] Crassweller writes that the foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the Peronist unions and private businesses, and that the Confederación General del Trabajo donated three man-days (later reduced to two) of salary for every worker per year. Tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support the foundation, as did a levy on casino and revenue from horse races. Crassweller also notes {{that there were some}} cases of businesses being pressured to donate to the foundation, with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met.|$|E
