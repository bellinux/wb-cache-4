5|$|Surgical {{exploration}} may {{be necessary}} to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some patients. Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> early-stage disease.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of benson relaxation technique and murottal Al-Qur 2 ̆ 7 an on blood pressure among <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> primary hypertension. The design was a quasy experiment research with non-equivalent control group. The research was conducted <b>to</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> primary hypertension in the “Puskesmas Harapan Raya”. The number of 30 sample respondents was obtained by purposive sampling technique who classified into 2 groups of 15 people as experimental group and the 15 people as control group. This research used digital tensimeter. The data analyzed by using dependent t-test and independent t-test. This result showed that blood pressure sistole diastole values before and after providing intervention in the experimental group, p value sistole = 0, 000 and p value diastole = 0, 001 which meant that there was effect of benson relaxation technique and murottal Al-Qur 2 ̆ 7 an on blood pressure <b>to</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> primary hypertension. The result is expected of benson relaxation technique and murottal Al-Qur 2 ̆ 7 an can be a nursing intervention to decrease blood pressure <b>to</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> primary hypertension...|$|R
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E

25|$|Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe nonfluent aphasia. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> anomic aphasia. Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E
