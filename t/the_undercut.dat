The other Williams of Felipe Massa had applied <b>the</b> <b>undercut</b> well {{in the early part}} of the race to recover from his pit lane-start to eighth position, but when his tyres started to degrade he was passed by both Sergio Pérez and Daniil Kvyat and finished tenth, taking one point. The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, just being able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E
5|$|On lap 34, both Hamilton and Vettel came in {{for their}} second and final planned stop, both {{equipping}} the medium tyre set. <b>The</b> <b>undercut</b> worked once more for the Ferrari, as Rosberg emerged behind Vettel one lap later. However, Vettel ran wide on the exit of the final corner on lap 36, letting Rosberg past and damaging his front wing, meaning {{he had to come}} into the pit lane for an unscheduled stop on the next lap, leaving him down in fifth position. His teammate Räikkönen made a second pit stop on lap 40, taking the softer and faster tyres, trying to catch the two Mercedes {{towards the end of the}} race. Fourteen laps before the finish, Räikkönen was fifteen seconds down on second-placed Rosberg, but closing by more than a second per lap. With the Mercedes in front having to make their way through backmarkers, Räikkönen was able to cut down the gap even faster, reaching Rosberg with three laps of the race to go. Rosberg, suffering from brake overheating over the entire course of the race, outbraked himself at turn one on lap 56, which allowed Räikkönen to take second place from him. The other Mercedes of Hamilton had brake problems as well towards the end, but was able to control the gap to the Ferrari to take his third victory of the season.|$|E

In the Meat chapter, these begin with recipes for beef, including [...] "Baron of Beef", [...] "Sirloin (Norman-French, sur loin)", [...] "Rib of Beef", [...] "Boiled Beef with Carrots", and [...] "Oat Pudding, for Boiled Beef". Each recipe has a heading in italics; some have an illustration, drawn by Hartley, or else a quotation or proverb. There is no list of ingredients. The first paragraph often describes the dish or its ingredients. Thus for sirloin, she advises [...] "This is the best beef joint and should be roasted. Never have <b>the</b> <b>undercut</b> taken out...". The instructions are given in a few paragraphs: [...] "Let the sirloin be well hung; dust it lightly with dry mustard, pepper and brown flour to give a crisp crust; bed the fat end well under the lean undercut, and secure in place with string or carefully placed skewer. Roast carefully, basting frequently." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{turned parts}} an {{undercut}} {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove". They are often used {{at the end of the}} threaded portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that <b>the</b> <b>undercut</b> should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and robust model is {{presented}} to explain the main reason behind undercutting at convex corners and no-undercutting at concave corners. The etch rate of the tangent plane at convex corner {{and the role of}} dangling bond in etching process are utilized to explain <b>the</b> <b>undercutting</b> at convex corner and the no-undercutting at concave corner, respectively. The present model shows that { 110 } is the tangent plane at convex corner which exhibits higher etch rate than the neighboring { 111 } plane in all types of anisotropic etchants; consequently <b>the</b> <b>undercutting</b> occurs at convex corners. The absence of dangling bonds at concave corner prevents <b>the</b> <b>undercutting</b> there. Moreover, <b>the</b> same model explains the reason of very less <b>undercutting</b> when <b>the</b> etching is carried out in surfactant-added tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).|$|R

The Early English capital has, therefore, the three greatest faults that any design can have: (1) it fails in its own proper purpose, that of support; (2) it is adapted to a purpose to which it can never be put, that of keeping off rain; (3) it cannot be decorated.|$|E
