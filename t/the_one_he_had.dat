5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E
5|$|Aslam {{arrives at}} the address Khan has given him and, much to his shock, sees Jasmine walking towards his car. Initially angry that he is still {{following}} her, the two realize {{that they have been}} caught up in a complicated affair - that Aslam, unbeknownst to Jasmine, works for Khan, and that Jasmine was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been sent to pick up. Before either can speak, a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance. Rawal shoots Jasmine, having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into a vulnerable position.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{met with}} Groves on 30 January 1948 to {{evaluate}} his performance. Eisenhower recounted {{a long list}} of complaints about Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, insensitivity, contempt for the rules and maneuvering for promotion out of turn. Eisenhower made it clear that Groves would never become Chief of Engineers. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar military he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> held in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 24 January 1948, just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the Manhattan Project. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test.|$|E

5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{had been}} keen {{to return to}} {{excavation}} in Britain. Based on <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium {{in the summer of}} 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock's wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{public outrage}} on Sunday and Monday, the GJKT acknowledged {{some responsibility for}} the problem, and on Tuesday gave Senecal a prize equal to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost. He was also awarded first place in a special category. However, some of the anger was directed towards Don Combs, who did nothing wrong. On several websites, he was portrayed as a bad guy by individuals who were ignorant of the facts. The GJKT did nothing to restore Comb's reputation.|$|E

25|$|He led DESTO's {{project in}} {{classified}} black projects {{to compete with}} missile gap with India, after the country test firing the short-range missile. His tenure eventually ended when most projects were moved to KRL and SRC, and realized that the postwar military and the civilian governments would not be given any assignment to him and as approaching in importance <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> held the program in Kahuta. In 1990, he completed his tenure and eventually retired from the military, ending his 40-year long military service.|$|E
25|$|A month later, he {{returned}} and asked Connolly {{if he was}} still interested in doing business. Connolly said yes, but {{that he would not be}} able to sell him any as he had gotten some bottles of P2P elsewhere and was busy making another batch. Three days later, Shapiro returned with a search warrant. Among other items, he seized two bottles of P2P, one an empty 500-g container, the other a partially full 100-g one (not <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> originally given them). All three were arrested and charged with five separate violations of federal drug laws.|$|E

25|$|But Charles {{was in no}} case {{to resume}} his {{northern}} march. Fairfax and the New Model, after reducing Bridgwater, had turned back to clear away the Dorsetshire Clubmen and to besiege Sherborne Castle. On the completion of this task, it had been decided to besiege Bristol. On 23 August 1645, while the King's army was still in Huntingdon, and Goring was trying to raise a new army to replace <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost at Langport and Bridgwater, the city was invested. In these urgent circumstances Charles left Oxford for the west only {{a day or two}} after he had come in from the Eastern Association raid. Calculating that Rupert could hold out longest, he first moved to the relief of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|During the 2011–12 season, Rakitić {{continued}} to be a first team regular and a key component of the squad. Due to managerial changes and new tactical schemes introduced by new coach Marcelino, who was later replaced by Míchel, Rakitić was given a different role on the pitch than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the previous season, when he was used as central midfielder under coach Gregorio Manzano; {{during the course of the}} season, he was mostly deployed as a defensive midfielder. By the end of the season, he made total of 39 appearances for the club, provided six assists and scored one goal in the 2011–12 Copa del Rey. This turned out to be his only goalless Liga season while playing for Sevilla.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{neglected}} to tell Mansell that Prost had signed for 1993 at {{only the second}} race of the 1992 season in Mexico, a position that Mansell felt {{would be similar to}} their days together at Ferrari. To boot, Ayrton Senna had expressed a strong desire to drive for Williams and even offered to drive for them at no salary (only to later be rebuffed as Prost, whose rivalry with the Brazilian was just as intense as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with Mansell, had a clause written into his contract which enabled him to block Senna's effort). Williams decided that there was little sense in paying the high fees Mansell went on to demand. With the original offer revoked, and with the premiere teams already committed to their incumbent drivers, Mansell decided to move on. An 11th hour offer was made to him at the Italian Grand Prix, but by then the damage was done; Mansell retired from F1.|$|E

5000|$|A further clue to {{fixing the}} date of {{invention}} of the process {{is that when the}} Paris correspondent of the London periodical The Athenaeum reported the public announcement of the daguerreotype in 1839, he mentioned that the daguerreotypes now being produced were considerably better than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen [...] "four years earlier".|$|R
25|$|By {{then the}} process of {{choosing}} a location for the Games had itself become a commercial concern; allegations of corruption rocked the International Olympic Committee. In the Atlanta games in 1996, the highlight was 200 meters runner Michael Johnson annihilating the world record {{in front of a}} home crowd. Canadians savored Donovan Bailey's recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when Muhammad Ali, clearly affected by Parkinson's disease, lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> discarded in 1960. The latter event took place not at the boxing ring but in the basketball arena, at the demand of US television. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a bomb exploded during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, Eric Robert Rudolph, was arrested.|$|E

Prévost later regretted the epithet, arguing that several other species were just as transparent as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> described. The common name [...] "fairy shrimp" [...] comes from the animal's delicate appearance, and the [...] "iridescent gleaming of the bristles on its appendages".|$|E

A few years later, after Carradine had experienced financial success with Kung Fu, he decided he wanted to make the story into a movie. He contacted Carr, who secured the rights to the Henry Morton Robinson novel, and began writing the screenplay. He told Carradine that the book contained a much more complicated story than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> told him.

500|$|In February 1993, Nirvana {{released}} [...] "Puss"/"Oh, the Guilt", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on {{the independent}} label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini, {{who had a}} reputation as a principled and opinionated individual in the American indie music scene, to record its third album. While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain insisted that Albini's sound was simply <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> always wanted Nirvana to have: a [...] "natural" [...] recording without layers of studio trickery. Nirvana traveled to Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, in that February to record the album. The sessions with Albini were productive and notably quick, and the album was recorded and mixed in two weeks for a cost of $25,000.|$|E
