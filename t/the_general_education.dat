25|$|In 1909, the Tennessee Legislature enacted <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Bill. This bill {{stated that}} three colleges be established, one within each grand {{division}} {{of the state and}} one additional school for African-American students. After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for West Tennessee: Jackson and Memphis. Memphis was chosen, {{one of the main reasons}} being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for West Tennessee. This would allow professors and students to go home and visit their relatives. The other three schools established through <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Act evolved into East Tennessee State University (ETSU), Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), and Tennessee State University (TSU).|$|E

25|$|When President Gates {{resigned}} in 1912, Fisk trustees began a national search to select his replacement.

25|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} education is subdivided into four stages such as the preschool education, the primary and low secondary education, high secondary education and the special education. The preschool education is for children {{from the age of}} one to five. The {{primary and secondary}} education is obligatory for everyone. It is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools and also available in languages of recognized minorities in the country, where classes are held in Albanian, Serbian, Bosnian, Turkish and Croatian. The first phase (primary education) includes classes from one to five and the second phase (low secondary education) classes from six to nine. The third phase (high secondary education) consist <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>education</b> but also the professional education, that is focused on different fields. It lasts four years. However, pupils are offered possibilities of applying for higher or university studies. According to the Ministry of Education, children who are not able to get a general education are able to get a special education (fifth phase).|$|E

500|$|One of {{his most}} {{influential}} reforms as president was {{the founding of the}} new University College as an academic division within the University of Florida in 1935. [...] The college was modeled on <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>education</b> college at the University of Chicago, and administered the freshman and sophomore-year liberal arts education of undergraduates before they were accepted to the university schools or colleges that administered their academic majors. [...] The college's stated purpose was to [...] "stimulate intellectual curiosity" [...] and [...] "encourage independent work", with new liberal arts requirements in biology, English language and literature, the humanities, logic, mathematics, physical sciences and social sciences, and thereby counter the growing trend toward [...] "trade school" [...] education at the university level.|$|E
500|$|The latter {{years of}} Matheson's {{presidency}} were troubled by a chronic shortage of funds. In 1919–1920, facilities designed for 700 {{students had to}} serve 1,365 students, and the school received the same $100,000 appropriation (...) that it had received since 1915, made worse by inflation which nearly halved its value in that time. Matheson was able to acquire a $25,000 increase from the General Assembly that year. In 1920–1921, though, an increase of $125,000 (to $250,000) was passed but subsequently tabled due to differences between the House and Senate {{version of the bill}} unrelated to Tech. To continue running the school, a frantic scramble for funds was undertaken, resulting in $40,000 from <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Board, $30,000 from a loan fund organized by the Georgia Rotary Club, and a grant from the Atlanta City Council. The University of Georgia, in a similar financial condition, was forced to cut its faculty's salary. After this drama, the situation still did not improve: in 1922–1923, only $112,500 of the requested $250,000 had been appropriated, leading Matheson to reluctantly start charging in-state students for tuition. The rates were $100 for in-state students (...) and $175 for out-of-state students (...) [...] Georgia Tech still needed a $125,000 line of credit against its first professional fund-raising effort, the [...] "Greater Georgia Tech Campaign".|$|E
2500|$|After Booker T. Washington's {{death in}} 1915, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Board {{targeted}} Fisk University {{as an experiment}} for funding and promoting Black liberal arts {{higher education in the}} United States. The project was collaborative effort of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Board, the Fisk Board of Trustees and sociologists Thomas Jesse Jones and Fayette Avery McKenzie. The goals were to position Fisk University as the premier Black liberal arts college in the United States, to demonstrate Blacks could attain high levels of academic achievement and compete with Whites in the nation's best colleges and universities, and to develop a Black professional and intellectual class to promote uplift. [...] The greatest challenge for the project was how to promote Black education and uplift without alienating white Southerners, many of whom vehemently opposed any form of Black advancement. The strategy was to maintain Booker T. Washington's model of student conduct and to engage the Nashville White community. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Board and the Fisk Board of Trustees believed that incremental actions would over time naturally lead to Black uplift and advancement, and they approached the problem with a distinct long-term orientation. In 1919, the Fisk experiment was energized when Rosenwald donated $50Million to <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Board for management. Between 1925 and 1935, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Education</b> Board appropriated over $5million to Black liberal arts colleges and universities.|$|E
