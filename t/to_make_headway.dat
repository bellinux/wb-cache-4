5|$|The Battle of Hürtgen Forest {{began on}} 19 September, with the assault of the 3rd Armored and 9th Infantry Divisions. The battle quickly turned {{into one of}} attrition; by mid-October the two Allied {{divisions}} had lost nearly 80% of their total combat strength, or roughly 4,500 men, while the Germans had lost close to 3,300. On 2 November the U.S. 28th Infantry Division entered the fight, but was not able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> {{and was forced to}} defend itself against German counterattacks between 5–7 November. The 28th Infantry Division lost over 6,100 combat casualties in Hürtgen.|$|E
5|$|Pope Pius II's {{crusade against}} the Ottoman Empire was {{declared}} in November 1463. Skanderbeg, {{the leader of}} the Albanians, was a vital ally to this effort and would have become one of its main leaders. The Venetians, who had also joined the crusade, could not persuade Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's lukewarm ally in northern Albania, to join until the pope intervened. Furthermore, the major European powers were reluctant to join the pope's crusade. Among those inquired were the city of Florence, Francisco Sforza of Milan, Louis XI of France, and Ferdinand I of Naples, all of whom declined for their own reasons. The Republic of Venice, however, decided to aid Skanderbeg by sending 500 cavalry and 500 infantry under the condottiero Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto. Once the campaign season began, Mathias Corvinus of Hungary recaptured many of the Bosnian strongpoints, including Jajce, which had been taken from the Kingdom of Bosnia by the Ottomans. Mehmed II marched into Bosnia, pillaging the countryside, hoping that his enemies would surrender. The Hungarian resistance, however, was stiff. The Ottomans still managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> against the Hungarians who had been trying to lift Ottoman the siege on Jajce with a ruse. The Sultan continued his siege while Mathias escaped from the fortress with a force of men, but the retreating army was harried with two-hundred soldiers being captured and sent to Constantinople for execution. Despite the setback, Jajce held out and Mehmed retreated from Bosnia.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{had secured}} Lae by 16 September 1943, and {{operations}} {{to capture the}} Huon Peninsula campaign had begun in earnest shortly after that, {{in an effort to}} secure Finschaffen before a drive on Saidor. Meanwhile, a secondary effort pushed inland from Lae through the Markham and Ramu Valleys, with the two drives eventually aiming towards Madang. As Allied forces began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> on the Huon Peninsula, Allied attention then turned to securing their seaward flank {{on the other side of}} the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits.|$|E

25|$|Markov {{was forced}} to deploy six battalions to cover his right flank against Dupont's {{threatening}} advance. Meanwhile, Bernadotte attacked in front as it began to get dark. Despite tough fighting, Dupont's flank attack began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> and Markov ordered a withdrawal. Around this time, General Anrep arrived and announced that cavalry reinforcements were coming. He was soon hit and carried off, fatally wounded. As they pulled back, the Russians resisted fiercely. Nevertheless, Dupont drove off the two regiments in his front and closed in on Georgenthal.|$|E
25|$|The {{culmination}} of material spanning back to 1993 resulted in two lengthy songs, each about 20 minutes in length. After the record's release, the band {{became interested in}} touring the United States. In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway,</b> they sent a copy of their album to the Chicago-based record label Kranky. Impressed by the recording, Kranky offered to republish the album on compact disc. The band quickly returned to the studio and re-recorded the album, which was released in June 1998. Changes to the album included the addition, subtraction and reorganization of material, resulting in three tracks and slightly over an hour of music.|$|E
25|$|Upon his election, {{he found}} the {{government}} coffers empty, as the state had exhausted itself {{in an attempt to}} recover from overspending on internal improvements during the 1830s. During his term, the government began to recover from the losses of the internal improvements. The Bigger administration had overseen a large reduction in the state's debt, but the government was still unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> on the nine-million dollar debt that still existed. During his first term, he advocated major spending cuts, including large cuts in government employee wages. Those cuts, along with steadily improving state revenues, enabled the government to manage its debt during his first term in office.|$|E

25|$|In principle, non-equilibrium {{statistical}} mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as Liouville's equation or its quantum equivalent, the von Neumann equation. These equations {{are the result}} of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. Unfortunately, these ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble's Gibbs entropy is preserved). In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> in modelling irreversible processes, it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Juel {{had taken}} up a {{position}} between the Swedish squadron and the outlet between the German mainland and the island of Falster. After a war council on 30 May, the Swedish force decided to attempt to sail around the Danish force and set a course for east-northeast on 31 May. The wind abated once more that day and both sides began towing their ships <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway.</b> The Swedish force tried to stay in formation by setting the pace by the slowest ships, and later that afternoon, the first Danish ships came within firing range. Before night fell, Drejer of Enigheden managed to overtake and capture Wrangel Palats. During the night, the wind picked up once more, which was to Juel's benefit.|$|E
25|$|The victorious French troopers {{chased the}} fugitives until they {{encountered}} Colloredo and Gajoli, deployed behind the Piavisella canal. Unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway,</b> the French cavalry withdrew. There was {{a lull in}} the battle as Eugène got as much infantry as possible to ford the river before the rising waters drowned the fords. John was unable {{to take advantage of}} the situation because his cavalry was beaten and demoralized. Late in the afternoon, the French commander launched his final attack, sending Grenier's corps against the Austrian left and Jacques MacDonald's corps against Albert Gyulay's Piavisella line. When Grenier dislodged his left flank brigade, John ordered a general retreat back to Conegliano. The French lost about 2,000 casualties, while the Austrian losses numbered 398 killed, 697 wounded, 1,681 captured, and 1,120 missing, for a total of 3,896 men and 15 guns lost.|$|E

25|$|David II's new co-regents sent a {{plea for}} help to Philip VI, who in November 1334 advised Edward III that he was sending an {{ambassador}} to England to discuss the matter. Accordingly, when Edward III returned from Roxburgh in February 1335, it was to find the Bishop of Avranches waiting, demanding to know why Edward III was acting against David II and David's queen, Edward's own sister Joan. Edward III deferred his answer, {{but in the meantime}} agreed to allow the ambassadors to try to negotiate peace between England and Scotland. As serious as the French ambassadors may have been at their task, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> with the co-regents of David II, who were at this time divided by their own disagreements about governance. What they did do, unwitting as they may have been, was allow time for the English to restore their finances.|$|E

The side whose naval forces arrived first would have decisive advantage in the siege.|$|E
500|$|Treasure began {{development}} on four games {{after the release}} of Gunstar Heroes, among these was Alien Soldier. Development lasted two years and was led by Hideyuki Suganami, who originally held ambitious plans and wanted to build the entire game himself. With the market for the Mega Drive quickly shrinking <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> for the incoming 32-bit fifth generation hardware, Suganami received support from other Treasure staff and released the game with only about half of his original ideas realized. The team designed and marketed Alien Soldier explicitly for [...] "hardcore" [...] Mega Drive gamers, designing its difficulty and scoring methods for those that enjoyed the system's strong action game library.|$|E

500|$|Lewis {{prevented}} the communists from making inroads at Oxford. Ted Jolliffe stated [...] "there {{was a difference}} between his speeches at the Union and his speeches at the Labour Club. [...] His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains {{the failure of the}} Communists <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> there. [...] There were so many naive people around who could have been taken in." [...] He increased the Labour Club's membership by three quarters by the time he left.|$|E
500|$|Although Mitchell had {{required}} [...] "war-time conditions", {{the ships}} sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless {{and had no}} damage control. The sinking of Ostfriesland was accomplished by violating an agreement {{that would have allowed}} Navy engineers {{to examine the effects of}} various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, [...] "No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them." [...] While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot. Rear Admiral William A. Moffett used public relations against Mitchell <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.|$|E
500|$|Much of Kruger's efforts {{over the}} next year were {{dedicated}} to attempts to acquire a sea outlet for the South African Republic. In July Pieter Grobler, who had just negotiated a treaty with King Lobengula of Matabeleland, was killed by Ngwato warriors on his way home; Kruger alleged that this was the work of [...] "Cecil Rhodes and his clique". Kruger despised Rhodes, considering him corrupt and immoral—in his memoirs he called him [...] "capital incarnate" [...] and [...] "the curse of South Africa". According to the editor of Kruger's memoirs, Rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting [...] "we simply take" [...] Delagoa Bay from Portugal; Kruger was appalled. Failing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> in talks with the Portuguese, Kruger switched his attention to Kosi Bay, next to Swaziland, in late 1888.|$|E
50|$|The two {{mediators}} {{met with}} members of the seven parties and attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some <b>headway</b> in the stalled negotiations by creating a framework to address concerns brought up in the pre-forming negotiations, something that the PS and the N-VA agreed to work within.|$|R

500|$|Adverse winds {{as well as}} {{damaged and}} leaky boats slowed the American fleet's progress. At Schuyler Island, Providence and Jersey were sunk or burned, and crude repairs were {{effected}} to other vessels. The cutter Lee was also abandoned on the western shore and eventually taken by the British. Around 2:00pm, the fleet sailed again, trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> against biting winds, rain, and sleet. By the following morning, the ships were still more than [...] from Crown Point, and the British fleet's masts were visible on the horizon. When the wind finally changed, the British had its advantage first. They closed once again, opening fire on Congress and Washington, which were {{in the rear of}} the American fleet. Arnold first decided to attempt grounding the slower gunboats at Split Rock, [...] short of Crown Point. Washington, however, was too badly damaged and too slow to make it, and she was forced to strike her colors and surrender; 110 men were taken prisoner.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{during the}} inauguration of an Islamic {{foundation}} in Kabul, Saleh said the Karzai government and the United States of America cannot represent the anti-Taliban Afghan civilians and initiate peace talks while simultaneously excluding them. The former Afghan Intelligence Chief insisted on considering {{the views of the}} Afghan people during the peace talks process, as a majority of Afghans both in the northern and southern regions, he said, have negative views of the Taliban. [...] He also questioned the honesty of the Taliban's involvement in peace talks. The recent objections by nearly all major opposition parties come amid growing efforts by the US and Hamid Karzai <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> in secret talks with the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami. In these talks representatives from the anti-Taliban United Front, which fought the Taliban from 1994 until 2001 and unites leaders representing roughly 60% of Afghanistan's population, are being excluded. Criticizing the secretive nature of US talks with the Taliban, which they suspect might end in a return of the Taliban to power, opposition leaders have asked for a transparent UN-led peace process.|$|E
500|$|The British gunboats and Carleton then maneuvered {{within range}} of the American line. Thunderer and Maria were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>headway</b> against the winds, and did not {{participate}} in the battle, while Inflexible eventually came far enough up the strait to participate in the action. [...] Around 12:30pm, the battle began in earnest, with both sides firing broadsides and cannonades at each other, and continued all afternoon. Revenge was heavily hit; Philadelphia was also heavily damaged and eventually sank around 6:30pm. Carleton, whose guns wrought havoc against the smaller American gundalows, became a focus of attention. [...] A lucky shot eventually snapped the line holding her broadside in position, and she was seriously damaged before she could be towed out of range of the American line. Her casualties were significant; eight men were killed and another eight wounded. The young Edward Pellew, serving as a midshipman aboard Carleton, distinguished himself by ably commanding the vessel to safety when its senior officers, including its captain, Lieutenant James Dacres, were injured. Another lucky American shot hit a British gunboat's magazine and the vessel exploded.|$|E
