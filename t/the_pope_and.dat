5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} marital {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor CharlesV, and English forces captured Boulogne at great cost in September, but soon England {{was left in the}} lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a separate peace.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} restore the glory of his empire and to regaining superpower status. His foreign policy was both ambitious and expansive, reaching out to {{all corners of the}} Mediterranean world. He made several alliances with <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> Western Christian kingdoms, and successfully handled the passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire, establishing a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the break}} with Rome, it was <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> general councils of the Church that decided doctrine. Church law was governed by canon law with final {{jurisdiction}} in Rome. Church taxes were paid straight to Rome, and the Pope had {{the final word}} in the appointment of bishops.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

5|$|He {{left for}} Italy in October 1222 {{to attend a}} conference about a new crusade. At John's request, Pope Honorius {{declared}} that all lands conquered during the crusade should be united with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. To plan the military campaign, <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II met at Ferentino in March 1223; John attended the meeting. He agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Frederick II after the emperor promised that he would allow John to rule the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> <b>and</b> Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E

5|$|Nothing more {{is known}} of Cragh after his {{testimony}} to the papal commission in 1307. Thirty-eightposthumous miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe were examined by the commissioners and submitted for consideration by <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> his advisors. Twelve were rejected after further analysis, including Cragh's resurrection, but no reasons were recorded. Pope John XXII formally announced Cantilupe's canonisation on 17 April 1320, thirty-eight years after the new saint's death.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} {{and this time}} Venetian rule would last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> <b>and</b> captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before Anselm {{went into}} exile in 1097 Warelwast searched his baggage, {{probably}} looking for communications to the pope, either from Anselm or other English bishops {{rather than for}} valuables, and in particular for any letters of complaint. Warelwast was the king's envoy at Rome when during his exile Anselm petitioned to have the king excommunicated, which according to Eadmer, who was also present, Warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> papal officials. The king had sent Warelwast to Urban at Christmas 1098, with his reply to a letter the pope had written ordering the restoration of Anselm's estates.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, {{but the rest of the}} family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The first {{cross on}} the {{mountain}} was placed there in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, {{the founder of the}} city, in fulfilment of a vow he made to the Virgin Mary when praying to her to stop a disastrous flood. Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the John the Baptist Society and now owned by the city. It was converted to fibre optic light in 1992. The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> the election of the next.|$|E

5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> <b>and</b> the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E
5|$|Although he feuded with York {{over the}} primacy, it appears clear that Ralph {{considered}} the Investiture Crisis settled in England for, in 1117 while visiting Rome, {{he took a}} neutral position as regards the issues between <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> the Emperor. In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David's in the royal chapel, although Robert of Meulan, the king's chief counsellor, advocated that the consecration must {{take place in the}} royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in Normanday, as he attended the provincial synod, or Council of Rouen, held in 1118.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> <b>and</b> had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
