5|$|Nasser's first {{battlefield}} {{experience was}} in Palestine during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He initially volunteered {{to serve with}} the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) led by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. Nasser met with and impressed al-Husayni, but was ultimately refused entry to the AHC's forces by <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> for reasons that were unclear.|$|E

5000|$|The Public Debt Commission was {{abolished}} by {{a bilateral}} {{agreement between the}} British and <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>governments,</b> signed on 17 July 1940, due to Allied interest in improving relations with Cairo during the Second World War.|$|R

5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government,</b> {{with the intention of}} transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1924, the Governor of Sudan Sir Lee Stack {{was shot}} and assassinated while driving through Cairo. The British responded with anger, {{demanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> a public apology, an inquiry, suppression of demonstrations and payment of a large fine. Further, they demanded withdrawal of all Egyptian officers and Egyptian army units from the Sudan, an increase to the scope of an irrigation scheme in Gezira and laws to protect foreign investors in Egypt.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, World Media Services, {{publisher}} of the Brotherhood’s Ikhwaan Press, set up a location in a nondescript London suburb, keeping a low profile given <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government’s</b> pursuit to arrest and sentence members of the organization.|$|R

5|$|On 27 September, a large {{batch of}} reservists were given orders for mobilization. To lull suspicion, the Cabinet Ministers of <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>Government</b> {{were invited to}} an open tour of General Headquarters, where all {{planning}} and coordination of the operation took place. Another batch of reservists were called up on September 30. To quell suspicion once more, the Egyptians publicly announced on 4 October the demobilization of the reservists who had been called up on 27 September, but only demobilized 20,000 men.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a {{religious}} leader, the self-proclaimed Mahdi, declared a jihad against <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government,</b> which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a decade earlier. Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, the Mahdi began to accumulate followers and soon presented a serious threat to the government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force only increased their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E
5|$|After the expedition, the {{independent}} country of Darfur, and its inhabitants, {{became part of}} Sudan. The £500,000 bill {{for the cost of}} the expedition was sent to <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>Government</b> in Cairo for payment by the Egyptian taxpayers. The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E
25|$|Although Egypt is a {{founding}} signatory {{to both the}} 1951 Refugee Convention and the OAU Refugee Convention, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government’s</b> lack of implementation and numerous conditions entered into the 1951 Convention substantially limit the rights of refugees in Egypt.|$|R

5|$|Egypt gained full {{independence}} {{with the}} Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown {{by a group}} of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser, later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman visited London and met the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden on 11 November 1952. On 10 January 1953 <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro-independence Sudanese parties that gave the Sudanese the right of self-determination. During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a Sudanese government formed. British and Egyptian troops and officials would leave the country and would be replaced by Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the Eyalet of Egypt, a {{province}} of the Ottoman Empire, ordered a series of ironclad warships from foreign shipyards. Iclaliye was the last vessel to be ordered by <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government.</b> The contract was awarded to the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1868. By this time, Egyptian efforts to assert their independence had angered Sultan Abdülaziz, who on 5 June 1867 demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, Egypt surrendered Iclaliye and the other Egyptian ironclads {{in exchange for the}} central government recognizing greater autonomy, transforming the Eyalet into the Khedivate of Egypt. Iclaliye was a slightly enlarged version of the earlier s that had been built in France, carrying a slightly more powerful armament.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government's</b> {{restructuring}} {{and economic reform}} programme resulted in the revival of <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> stock market, and {{a major change in}} the organisation of the Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges took place in January 1997 with the election of a new board of directors and the establishment of a number of board committees.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{followed up}} on a prisoner amnesty from the previous day, releasing 1,000 more prisoners who had served three-quarters of their sentence; 840 more were released from Sinai province. The Muslim Brotherhood continued to demand for Mubarak's resignation. The offices of state-owned Channel 5 in Alexandria were shut down and evacuated under the order of its chief amid mounting pressure by protesters. The government warned of a military crackdown amid ongoing protests. Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected US calls to repeal the emergency law and also accused the US of trying to impose its will on <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government.</b> The newly appointed Mubarak's Culture Minister Gaber Asfour resigned after one week in office, citing health problems.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{debate for}} an {{official}} Canadian flag intensified {{and became a}} subject of controversy, culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964. In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces {{on the grounds that the}} Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century Egyptologists {{studied the}} temples intensively, but their {{emphasis}} was on collection of artifacts to send to their own countries, and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm. Slowly the antique-hunting attitude toward Egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts. The government also took greater control of archaeological activity as Egypt's independence from foreign powers increased. Yet even in recent times the ancient remains have faced threats. The most severe was {{the construction of the}} Aswan High Dam in the 1960s, which threatened to submerge the temples in what had been Lower Nubia beneath the newly formed Lake Nasser. A major effort by the United Nations disassembled some of the threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground, and <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> gave several of the others, such as Dendur, Taffeh, and Debod, as gifts to nations that had contributed to the preservation effort. Nevertheless, several other temples vanished beneath the lake.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} of Iran condemned <b>the</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government's</b> response to protests and was harshly {{critical of the}} Bahraini monarchy's reaction to the demonstrations in the Gulf archipelago, but has virtually ignored President Bashar al-Assad's violent suppression of protests during the uprising in Syria {{and according to the}} U.S. government, has possibly provided aid to suppressing the protests.|$|R

5|$|Today {{there are}} dozens of sites with {{substantial}} temple remains, although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or Middle Egypt are well preserved. Those that are well preserved, such as Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the Egyptian tourist industry, which is a major sector of the Egyptian economy. Three temple sites—Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae—have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. <b>The</b> <b>Egyptian</b> <b>government</b> is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to protect ancient monuments from the harmful effects of tourist activity. Archaeological work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts are improving modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.|$|E
