5|$|Specimens of B.ilicifolia {{were first}} {{collected}} by Scottish surgeon Archibald Menzies during <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791, but this collection {{did not result}} in the description of the species. It was next collected by Robert Brown in December 1801, during <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> HMS Investigator to King George Sound. The species was also drawn by the expedition's botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer. Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original field sketch of B.ilicifolia was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} Imperator Alexandr III, named after Tsar Alexander III, on 5 September 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 23 May 1900 and {{launched}} on 3 August 1901. In August 1902 {{she was in}} Reval for <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, and took part in combined fleet maneuvers with ships from the German navy. She was completed in November 1903 {{at the cost of}} 13,979,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous Tintin books, Hergé deliberately broke the adventure formula he had created. It is the only book in the Tintin series where the characters remain at home in Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock's family estate in Belgium, and do not travel abroad or confront dangerous criminals. The plot concerns <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> the opera singer Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent theft of her emerald.|$|E

5|$|A National Anthem Committee {{was formed}} in 1948, but it had {{difficulty}} finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of the Shah of Iran in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on August 10, 1950 and was approved for playing during <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> the Shah. However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on August 13, 1954. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on August 16, 1954 followed by a performance of the national anthem in 1955 involving eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{different}} players {{were used by}} Nelson during their 44 competitive matches, {{less than half of}} whom had played for the club in previous campaigns. Goalkeeper Harry Abbott and half-back Ernie Braidwood were the two ever-presents for Nelson during 1924–25. Centre forward Joe Eddleston scored 26 goals in 43 games to become the team's top goalscorer for the fourth consecutive season. Two Nelson records were set during the campaign, although one was later broken; the seven-goal winning margin against Crewe Alexandra was never bettered in Football League matches, while the attendance of 13,500 for <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> Darlington in April 1925 was the largest ever seen at Seedhill at that time.|$|E
5|$|After a year, Matlock was {{promoted}} to Third Secretary in the Political Section. American foreign policy {{with regard to the}} Soviet Union, known as containment, had been articulated in 1947 by George F. Kennan, who was later to become a good friend of Matlock’s. The American policy was basically to contain the spread of Communism, in the expectation that it would eventually collapse of internal contradictions. This did not prevent discussions between the Superpowers. In June 1961, President John F. Kennedy and First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev met in Vienna, and in December the United Nations General Assembly approved a draft joint resolution on principles for negotiating disarmament. This period also saw the beginnings of U.S. - U.S.S.R. cultural exchanges, notably <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> poet Robert Frost to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in English {{cities in the}} Middle Ages, Canterbury {{employed}} a town band known as the Waits. There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this. The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> King Charles II on his return from exile. Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. A modern early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{tendering}} process, {{the four}} G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from John Brown, Swan Hunter, William Beardmore and Fairfield. Following <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> an Admiralty delegation, detailed constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors. Work at John Brown progressed on the keel blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. Notwithstanding other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the Admiralty until 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was {{requested}} by the king to make several modifications to the flag; {{he is responsible for}} its current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E
5|$|Bruix, {{named after}} Admiral Étienne Eustache Bruix, was laid {{down at the}} Arsenal de Rochefort on 9 November 1891.

The ship was temporarily assigned to the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord) on 24 November for <b>the</b> <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife to Dunkerque on 5–9 October. The ship's steering broke down on 7 October {{and she had to}} return to Rochefort for repairs. Trials lasted until early December and Bruix was officially commissioned on 15 December and assigned to the Northern Squadron.|$|E
