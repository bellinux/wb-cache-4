5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate <b>to</b> <b>evolve</b> into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the evolution of trust, control, and learning in a joint venture relationship. Using a coevolutionary approach, we develop a framework that shows how initial joint venture conditions give way <b>to</b> <b>evolved</b> conditions as joint venture partners {{develop an understanding of}} each other and adjust the collaborative process. We explore the relationship between trust and control in joint ventures and identify how these two critical concepts impact joint venture processes. We argue that trust, along with partner collaborative objectives, creates the initial climate that shapes partner interactions. In turn, these interactions lead to subsequent decisions about the nature of controls. We then examine linkages between alliance learning and the trust and control concepts, and argue that learning processes are central <b>to</b> <b>evolving</b> joint venture dynamics. Once the joint venture is formed, and if the initial conditions support continued collaboration, then learning processes will be central <b>to</b> <b>evolving</b> alliance dynamics. As initial conditions give way <b>to</b> <b>evolved</b> conditions, learning and trust will coevolve and impact decisions about control. Propositions linking the concepts are provided as guides for future empirical research. Key words: coevolution; trust; control; learning; joint ventures Trust, control, and learning are three of the most important and studied concepts in the alliance and joint venture literatures.

5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is <b>to</b> <b>evolve</b> and make themselves more powerful.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation <b>to</b> <b>evolve.</b>|$|E

5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad.

Earlier geothermal exploration, carried out from the mid 1970 ’s to the earlier 1990 ’s by government institutions with the aid of foreign technical assistance programs, defined a combined theoretical potential of about 500 MWe for the three most promising geothermal prospects, namely: Tufiño-Chiles, Chalupas and Chachimbiro, located in the highlands of central-north Ecuador.
