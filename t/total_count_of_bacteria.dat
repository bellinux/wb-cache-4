We conclude that bacteriological eggshell contamination and percentage of cracked eggs differed substantially between individual farms using the same housing system. This may also explain some discrepancies between the findings of the present study versus some findings of previous experimental studies or studies on a small number of farms. Although statistically significant, the average differences in bacteriological contamination of nest eggs between both housing systems have limited microbiological relevanc...|$|R
40|$|The roles {{played by}} {{environmental}} factors in seasonal changes in microbial populations were investigated in the Tvärminne area, off {{the southern coast}} of Finland. Surface-layer samples were collected at 1 - or 2 -week intervals in 1976 - 78, and 14 microbiological and 10 environmental parameters were determined. Stepwise multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} explain seasonal variation in the microbiological parameters. Separate analyses were made of the data from the open-water and ice-cover periods. In analyses of data from both periods, the environmental factors included accounted for a significant proportion of the variation in the parameters for community respiration (90 %) and bacterial spores (80 %), and a smaller proportion (60 to 65 %) of the variation in <b>total</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> and plate <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> psychrophiles and yeasts. Lower values (40 to 55 %) were obtained for the variation in the other microbiological parameters. The environmental factors with maximal contributions were organic matter, water temperature, chlorophyll a, and salinity, but rainfall and winds also explained part of the variation in some microbiological parameters. In the winter analysis the results differed from those obtained for the other seasons, the variation being governed by parameters indicating freshwater outflows, namely, humic matter, salinity, water temperature (positive regression coefficient), and rainfall (negative regression coefficient) ...|$|R
40|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} against {{nine different}} bacteria isolated from Lake Sælenvannet in western Norway were produced, {{and the population}} dynamics of these strains in the lake were monitored through two spring seasons by immunofluorescence staining. The <b>total</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> varied over time and space from 1. 5 � 10 6 to 1. 5 � 10 7 cells ml � 1. The <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>bacteria</b> were {{in the range of}} 10 3 to 10 4 cells ml � 1 or less; in sum, they generally made up less than 1 % of the bacterial community. Some populations showed significant changes in abundance, with blooms lasting 1 to 3 weeks. The rate of change (increase and decrease) in abundance during blooms was estimated to be 0. 2 to 0. 6 day � 1. The average virus-to-bacteria ratio was 50, and there was a significant correlation between the abundances <b>of</b> virus and <b>bacteria.</b> Both protozoan grazing and lytic virus infection were assessed as possible mechanisms driving the variations in bacterial population density. In most ecological studies, bacteria are considered simply as bacteria, i. e., as one population where all individuals have the same or similar properties. The obvious reasons for this are that bacteria in general lack morphological characteristics which may be used to recognize them as members of specie...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{bacteria}} counting method based on polyaniline (PANI) /bacteria thin film was proposed. Since {{the negative effects}} of immobilized bacteria on the deposition of PANI on glass carbon electrode (GCE), PANI/bacteria thin films containing decreased amount of PANI would be obtained when increasing the bacteria concentration. The prepared PANI/bacteria film was characterized with cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique to provide quantitative index for the determination of the bacteria count, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed to further investigate the difference in the PANI/bacteria films. Good linear relationship of the peak currents of the CVs and the log <b>total</b> <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Bacillus subtilis) could be established using the equation Y=− 30. 413 X+ 272. 560 (R²= 0. 982) over the range of 5. 3 × 10 ⁴ to 5. 3 × 10 ⁸ CFU mL− 1, which also showed acceptable stability, reproducibility and switchable ability. The proposed method was feasible for simple and rapid counting of bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} microbiological, chemical and sensory properties of raw donkeys ’ milk from an autochthonous breed originated from Serbia. Changes in microbiota during the six days of storage at 4 °C were monitored by enumeration of <b>total</b> <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria,</b> yeasts and moulds, coagulase positive staphylococci, lactic acid bacteria, bacterial endospores, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. Descriptive method was used for determination of sensory properties. Descriptive terms were developed to describe appearance (colour), flavour, taste and aftertaste. Chemical analyses included determination of protein, milk fat, dry matter, lactose and vitamin C content. After five days of storage at 4 °C microbiological quality of the raw Domestic Balkan donkeys ’ milk was in accordance with the requirements of European Regulation. The obtained results indicate strong antimicrobial activity of the tested milk and longer shelf-life in comparison to other raw milk sources. Sensory properties of the tested raw milk were acceptable within four days of storage at 4 °C. High vitamin C content (32. 95 μg/mL), low protein (1. 67 %, w/w) and milk fat (0. 66 %, w/w) content make the tested milk a...|$|E
