5|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{reshuffle}} in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich {{to assume the}} post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He {{never made it to}} Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He enjoyed being in demand and was happy to be sent to France on a generous salary of 90,000 gulden a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint-Cloud; soon, the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards. Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using his charm to win great eminence there. The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> included Napoleon's sister Caroline Murat, Laure Junot, and perhaps many besides.|$|E

500|$|Laura Fries {{reviewed}} the film for Variety, describing it as a [...] "unique and lavish production <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> warrants attention" [...] but warning {{that it would}} be inappropriate for young children.

[...] However, she praised David Brisbin's set design, remarking that he had created a kingdom which was [...] "equal parts gingerbread baroque and David Lynch" [...] and that Caroline Thompson [...] "clearly relishes" [...] in this universe. Noting that the [...] "magnificently villainous performance" [...] from Miranda Richardson [...] "virtually steals the show" [...] from the [...] "doe-eyed" [...] Kristin Kreuk, she believes that the latter does [...] "little to upgrade" [...] the image of Snow White as the most victimized of fairytale characters.|$|E

Days stated: [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> an apology is justified {{with respect to the}} way the federal government handled its investigation: the FBI, the Justice Department, and my division [...] [...] [...] it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done." [...] FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990, stating: “In hindsight, the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated”. In 1984, the FBI conducted an internal review of its Cerro Maravilla Case files, and concluded that there was no cover-up effort inside the FBI, only a desire to avoid derailing [...] "the cooperative anti-terrorism effort" [...] with the Puerto Rican police.

David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in.

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review of the episode, [...] "Some {{sluggish}} stories took better turns this week – albeit sometimes by just ending things for now – while a book character many thought would never appear on the series made a notable splash, answering a big mystery that the novels hadn’t even revealed yet in the process. There were some great moments in [...] "Blood of My Blood", but mostly the big returns {{made it possible to}} salivate for the payoffs (and possible characters) to come." [...] He also continued by noting, [...] "this installment probably speaks, more than any other episode so far this season, to the accelerated rate of payoffs we're now getting that the show isn't directly following the books." [...] Fowler gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10. Laura Prudom of Variety also praised the pacing of the episode as well as the season's payoffs, writing [...] "There's a clarity of purpose in Season 6 <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> gives the impression that we're barreling towards a conclusion instead of just meandering through Dorne or killing time in Qarth." ...|$|E
