5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. The <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E
25|$|New {{options for}} 1967 {{included}} front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>player.</b> The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been devices shaped like robots such as the {{teaching}} computer, Leachim (1974), and 2-XL (1976), a robot shaped game / teaching toy based on an 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>player,</b> both invented Michael J. Freeman.|$|E

25|$|New {{this year}} was a dual master-cylinder braking system and {{optional}} front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing collapsible steering column. Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo <b>tape</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also in 1980 (for the 1981 model year), a new Sports Performance Package {{became an}} option, which {{included}} sport suspension, raised white letter tires, and {{front and rear}} spoilers. This also marked the last year that an 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> was offered in any Supra.|$|E
25|$|New {{options for}} 1967 {{included}} front disc brakes, stereo 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> and a Climate Combustion Control system for Rocket V8s designed to regulate carburetor air temperature, boost fuel economy, speed choke warm up and eliminate winter icing to permit easier starting {{and more efficient}} operation in cold weather.|$|E

25|$|Sales for the 1967 model, {{which was}} most notably {{distinguished}} by a slight facelift, {{the addition of}} optional disc brakes, and a slightly softer ride, dropped by nearly half, to 22,062. A stereo <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> was optional. It would be 1971 before the Toronado would match its first-year sales mark.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{available}} 1969 options were a tilt-telescope steering wheel, instant horn, four season air conditioning with comfortron, tinted glass windshield, 6-way power seat, divided front seat with dual controls, power trunk release (vacuum), power door locks, power front disc brakes, AM-FM stereo radio, rear seat speaker, stereo <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> (8-track), power operated antenna, door edge guards, cruise control, left outside remote control mirror, cornering lamps, anti-spin rear axle, vinyl roof, flo-thru ventilation, and safety sentinel.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1973, {{investigators}} {{found that an}} 18½-minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon’s longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods {{to answer the phone}} while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.|$|E
50|$|Howard Stelzer is a {{composer}} of electronic music, {{whose work is}} made primarily from sounds generated by cassette <b>tapes</b> and <b>tape</b> <b>players.</b> From 1997 until 2012, he ran the independent record label Intransitive Recordings.|$|R
50|$|These {{are common}} icons on {{physical}} devices and application software.

50|$|Today, {{equipment}} that supports physical media usually plays CDs. Some older systems may still use cassette tapes (sometimes employing endless-loops), or reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>players.</b> In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing {{of the mechanical}} parts.|$|R
25|$|As {{befitting}} {{a luxury}} car, Toronados featured {{a long list}} of standard equipment that included Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes along with an electric clock, carpeting and deluxe wheel covers. Virtually all Toronados were sold loaded with extra-cost options including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>player,</b> power trunk release, vinyl roof, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks and six-way power seats. Power windows became standard equipment in 1975. A new feature in 1974 was a gauge that monitored if the driver was driving economically or not.|$|E
25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E
25|$|Initially, 2500 Indy 500 replica pacers—100 {{for each}} year of production—were {{scheduled}} for sale. But {{it was decided that}} each of Chevrolet's 6502 dealers should have one for showroom display. Thus what was called the Limited Edition Indy Pace Car Replica Corvette made up some 15 percent of total production. Like the Silver Anniversary model, the Pace Car Replica was actually an option package-RPO Z78. Its main distinction was black over silver metallic with a bright red pinstripe in between with a spoiler added to each end to alter appearance more dramatically. Pace car interiors reflected Bill Mitchell's influence, with full silver leather or silver leather/gray cloth upholstery and gray carpeting. All replicas were equipped with new thin-shell design-lumbar support seats, new glass t-tops, alloy wheels, power windows, air conditioning, tilt/telescope steering wheel, power locks, rear defogger, sport mirrors, heavy-duty battery, and AM/FM stereo with either eight-track <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> or CB radio. The final touch was the Indy 500 decal set included uninstalled with each limited-edition car.|$|E

"In my East Village {{apartment}} in the late '70s, I remember throwing parties and instead of playing music I turned on kitchen appliances, <b>tape</b> <b>players,</b> fans, radios and a TV tuned between stations…I made my first installations before I knew that audio installations and sound art existed." ...|$|R
50|$|The centre {{was set up}} in {{four areas}} with over 800 resources; a {{borrowing}} section, a reference section, a resource making section and an ‘improving your own English’ section. The office was set up with a secure area to store electrical equipment such as <b>tape</b> <b>players,</b> headphones and laminators.|$|R
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E
500|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} {{has been}} converted to current media and is available for download. One popular program for converting Spectrum files from tape is Taper; it allows connecting a cassette <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> to the line in port of a sound card, or—through a simple home-built device—to the parallel port of a PC. Once in files on a host machine, the software can be executed on an emulator.|$|E
500|$|The game itself {{also has}} an {{alternate}} reality counterpart. Within the game are radio frequencies that hint to a real phone number. This phone number led players to the Twitter account @xray9169363733. The account posted various cryptic, coded messages, all of which seemed to point to a real world location. On May 7, 2016, Youtuber Jesse Cox posted a video similar to the PS4 Oxenfree trailer, but with several letters highlighted in red. This led players to www.edwardsisland.com. Several messages were found, but most important was [...] "MILNER IS WARD", confirming that a special object would be hidden at Fort Ward, WA. The object was revealed to be a box with letters by Alex from all the possible timelines from the game warning her {{not to go to}} Edwards island, and a manually operated <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> with two paper music tapes of songs from the game soundtrack.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, Hassler {{worked in}} the {{electronics}} and music business until retirement, including Transistronics (transistorized amplifiers and tuners), Earl Madman Muntz (car stereo and TVs), and Concord Electronics (reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>players).</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, he established and oversaw the operations of home electronics stores in the Phoenix area.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kelley {{listening}} to [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] on her Walkman as Mars walks in. Mars stops the <b>tape</b> <b>player,</b> removes the cassette tape and begins singing his song. As the instrumental {{portion of the}} song begins, Mars pulls the media out of the cassette tape and arranges the media into letters forming his name followed by the song title. As the song continues, he forms {{a picture of a}} drum, again on the table, using the tape media. Additional images of similar construction follow throughout the video including a portrait of Mars as well as one of Kelley blinking her eyes and smiling as Mars continues singing. Most of the images shown are animated, including a bell which Mars rings with his fingers in synchronization with the chimes {{near the end of the}} song. Lastly, Mars finishes the song while singing and playing an upright piano while Kelley watches and smiles. The video was inspired by the artwork of Erika Iris Simmons.|$|E
500|$|... "Focker" [...] {{was created}} using a looped riff from [...] "6/8 Focker". Eastgate then {{conceived}} a drum solo and remixed and rearranged the last 20 {{seconds of the}} song. [...] "The Enemy Are the Future" [...] was created during a hungover jam session, where all band members played individually and not in tandem. Dawson performed around 40 different beats one after another all in different timings. The session was recorded using a <b>tape</b> <b>player</b> and a track was moulded in the studio. Four different endings were recorded and three were spliced together at the end. [...] "Mad Dogs and Englishmen", whose riff {{is based on an}} old French samba song, was borne out of an interplay between Eastgate on the guitar and Faley on the bass. The last track on the album, [...] "Bathroom Gurgle", includes [...] "a squelchy grind of the riff" [...] purpose-built for the Liars Club audience during the band's first ever gigs. Eastgate has explained, [...] "I had these two themes, which looped round on each other which I sang very exasperated Annie Lennox style vocals over." [...] The fast tempo {{of the first half of}} the song was juxtaposed against a section of [...] "slow drama".|$|E
2500|$|A {{moderate}} facelift {{highlighted the}} 1967 Electra 225 including a Pontiac/Oldsmobile-like divided split grille.
