5|$|Metro {{contended that}} though TumbleSeed was marketed as a roguelike, {{apart from its}} procedurally {{generated}} levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games. Though like roguelikes, player mistakes are costly and unforgivingly punished by returning the player <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act of losing all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh.|$|E

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group dates back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. After a {{possible}} precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently {{rose out of}} the caldera, {{and at least a}} few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

5|$|For {{six days}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American offensive, Allied heavy {{artillery}} targeted German defenses around Aachen. Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it {{had little effect}} on the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E

Over 300,000 internally displaced Tamil civilians were interred in special camps and eventually released.

The opening of the Charter Oak Bridge and Hartford Bypass on September 5,1942 led to US 5 bypassing downtown Hartford on its current alignment; U.S. Route 5A, an alternate route {{on the west side of}} the Connecticut River to Springfield, was extended south along Main Street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bypass.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Jabala Upanishad was composed, {{as is true}} with most ancient Indian texts.

Hajime Nakamura, a Japanese scholar of Vedic literature, dates Jabala Upanishad along with Paramahamsa Upanishad to around {{the start of the}} common era. The German scholar of Upanishads, Joachim Sprockhoff, assigns it to be from the last few centuries prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common era, while the German Indologist Georg Feuerstein dates it to around 300 BCE.

5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the {{movement}} in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, {{and the manner in which}} oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining.

During the latter part of the Middle Preclassic (c.700–400 BC), the Pink Structure was buried under the first version of the enormous Structure 7. It was at this time that the use of Olmec ceremonial structures was discontinued and Olmec sculpture was destroyed, signalling an intermediate period prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's Early Maya phase.
