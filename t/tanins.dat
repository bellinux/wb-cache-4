Five different formulations were purchased from traditional medical dispensers in Aluu, Choba, Alakahia, Rumuosi and Rumuokoro communities in Obio/Akpor Local Gov-ernment Area of Rivers state Nigeria. Phytochemical studies revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, phenolics and cardiac glycosides.

40|$|Summary The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a methodology capable of modeling the effect of viticultural climate on wine sensory characteristics. The climate was defined by the Géoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System (Tonietto and Carbonneau, 2004), based on the Heliothermal index (HI), Cool Night index (CI) and Dryness index (DI). The sensory wine description was made according with the methodology established by Zanus and Tonietto (2007). In this study we focused on the 5 principal wine producing regions of Brazil: Serra Gaúcha, Serra do Sudeste, Campanha (Meridional and Central), Planalto Catarinense and Vale do Submédio São Francisco. The results from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) show the HI and CI opposed to the DI. High HI values were associated to a lower perception of acidity, as well as to a lower perception of concentration (palate) and persistence by mouth. For the red wines, high HI values were positively associated with alcohol (palate), conversely to the DI index, which showed high values related to the perception of <b>tanins</b> and acidity. The higher the CI, the lower were the color intensity, <b>tanins,</b> concentration and persistence by mouth. It may be concluded that viticultural climate - expressed by the HI, CI and DI indexes ? adequately explained much of the sensory differences of the wines made in different regions. The methodology proposed and the enlargement of the database it will maybe open the possibility of modeling the part of wine sensory characteristics as dependent variables of the viticultural climate, as defined by the Géoviticulture MCC System.

40|$|Total and {{hydroalcoholic}} extracts of {{the stem}} barks of Parkia biglobosa (Jacq) Benth. (Mimosaceae) were tested on strains belonging to three species of Shigellae: S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri and S. boydii collected from hospitals in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The results showed that both extracts were active against Shigellae. The hydroalcoholic extract was more active than the decoction (aqueous one) prescribed by the traditional healer. Both extracts were particularly effective against S. dysenteriae, the most virulent of the three pathogenic species. The effects of the extracts have been {{compared to that of}} gentamicin. The phytochemical screening on the extracts revealed the presence of sterols, triterpenes, polyphenolic compounds including <b>tanins,</b> flavonoids, coumarins, anthocyanidins.

40|$|Measurements of {{the zero}} current {{potential}} of a platinum electrode immersed in solutions of <b>tanins</b> or in wines of various origins, were performed during the additions of a solution of Ti(III), or of a solution of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), {{in order to obtain}} a global indication for the resistance to oxidation of some wines. The steady state intensity–potential curves on a platinum electrode highlight the occurrence of mixed potentials between the oxidation of ethanol or catechin and the reduction of oxygen present at very low concentrations, as well as the irreversibility of the redox system Ti(IV) /Ti(III). The adsorption of various species on the platinum and the slowness of the oxidation reactions by DCPIP exclude use of potentiometric titration theory. The shape of the potential–reagent volume curves depends {{on the nature of the}} solution and on the rate of reagent introduction. Generally, due to the slowness of the oxidation reactions with DCPIP it is impossible to find a linear relationship between the volume of titrant solution necessary to reach the inflexion point of the curves and the solution composition...|$|E

The amount of total phenolics in extracts was determined with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Gallic acid was used as a standard and the total phenolics were expressed as mg/g gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The formation of blue colour upon reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was the confirmatory test for the presence of phenols in the plant extract samples. Similarly, the formation of a red precipitate when the extract was boiled with 1 % aqueous hydrochloric acid indicated the presence of phlobatannins.
