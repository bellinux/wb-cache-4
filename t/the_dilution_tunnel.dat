40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of measurements conducted at the VELA- 2 laboratories of the JRC in February 2007. The aim of the experimental campaign was to provide the necessary experimental data to model aerosol processes from the vehicle¿s exhaust tailpipe to the sampling point at the full dilution tunnel. The measurements included particle and temperature profiles at the tailpipe, {{at the end of}} the exhaust gas transfer tube to <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (anaconda), at the diaphragm of <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> 1, 5 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm and 10 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm (normal sampling point). Two steady state speeds were used (50 and 120 km/h) and flow rates at <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> of 6 and 12 m 3 /min. Non-volatile and total particle number and mass concentrations were measured according to the protocol of the Particulate Measurement Programme. The results showed that the main changes of particle number distributions are observed along the transfer tube from the tailpipe to <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (anaconda). Afterwards the particle number distributions remain almost constant. However, low dilution at <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (flow rate of 6 m 3 /min) leads to a further small particle number distribution change. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} ways of {{measuring}} particle emission from wood combustion. Firstly, particles can be sampled directly in the chimney. Secondly, a dilution tunnel can be used, thus cooling the flue gases parallel to diluting. The purpose of this work is to investigate the differences between both measurements and establish {{which is the best}} method to measure particle emission from wood combustion. The approach is to perform particle emission measurements in the chimney and in a dilution tunnel simultaneously during the combustion of wood in a small-scale appliance. Moreover, Flame Ionization Analysis will be carried out to understand the contribution of condensed organic compounds to the total particulate matter emission. The particle emission measured in <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> was between 5 and 12 times higher than in the chimney. The more unfavourable combustion conditions, the larger the difference between both measurements was seen. The results also show a factor of about 2, 5 between both particle emission measured in the stack and Total Hydrocarbon content in the flue gas and particle emission measured in <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> indicating that about 35 % of the hydrocarbons measured in the stack with the Flame Ionization Detector condense along <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> accounting for approximately 85 % of the total particle emission found at this location. </p...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of Phase II evaluation of Particle Number (PN) Portable Measurement Systems (PEMS). 8 PN-PEMS were compared with legislation compliant PN systems connected to the tailpipe and <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (CVS). In total 7 Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI), 3 Port Fuel Injection (PFI), 2 Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) equipped vehicle, 1 moped and 3 motorcycles were tested with > 130 test cycles. The results confirmed the findings of Phase I: Diffusion Charging (DC) based systems are a feasible option to measure PN and thermal pre-treatment is necessary to avoid volatile artefacts. At least two of the DC based PN-PEMS showed good agreement with the reference PMP system (# 1, # 3). A third one (# 4) also had very good behaviour, but higher scatter. The best performing PN-PEMS had differences from the reference instrument at the tailpipe within - 25 % and + 30 % with a scatter of 20 % [...] The differences from the reference system at <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> were within - 35 % and + 50 % (scatter 25 %) (including all technologies tested); slightly higher due to the particle transformation processes that take place between the tailpipe and <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> exhaust flow accuracy and time alignment. It was also shown that a well calibrated PN-PEMS can cover a wide range of engine technologies with similar differences to the reference system. Based on the experimental data new PN-PEMS efficiencies were recommended for the technical requirements. The CPC based PN-PEMS had issues (prototypes). However, one CPC based PN-PEMS, which arrived late in the program, had behaviour equivalent to the reference systems and better real time comparability with the reference systems compared to the DC based systems. Further evaluation of the system after the campaign with another 10 vehicles confirmed these findings. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from <b>the</b> full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and <b>the</b> second from the partial flow system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the full flow and the partial flow system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (full flow, partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from <b>the</b> full flow <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>The</b> results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that full flow and partial flow systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

During the design process, a number of restrictions specified in the standards for emission and Venturis were taken into account.

A short algorithm of calculation of the critical flow Venturi (CFV) is also presented. Specific {{attention is paid to}} the problems of the measurement of particulate emissions using <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> method, which does not allow us to use the unique thermodynamic and flow parameters.

40|$|With the {{promulgation}} {{of the new}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 2. 5 in 1997, {{the measurement}} of fine particulate matter from stationary sources becomes more important. A series of tests have been performed on three different natural and refinery gas-fired sources using traditional manual methods (in-stack cyclones and filter with iced-impinger train) and dilution tunnel sampling. <b>The</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> mixes stack emissions with cleaned ambient air, cooling and diluting them to simulate {{what happens in the}} plume as emissions leave the stack. This type of sampling allows for extensive speciation of the PM 2. 5 fraction including elements, ions, organic and elemental carbon, semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). One result of particular interest is the low percentage of organic carbon (OC) accounted for by the SVOC results. At all locations, the sum of the SVOCs was less than 10 percent of the total OC measured using <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Dilution tunnel sampling is able to provide a more complete speciation of SVOCs, however this large discrepancy indicates that further investigation is needed. Differences in organic aerosol emissions from natural gas versus refinery gas combustion have also been observed. Results from these tests not only allow comparison of traditional manual methods to dilution sampling, but also allow comparison to ambient sampling results and utilization of data in atmospheric models, such as chemical mass balance models...|$|E
40|$|JRC {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} using PN-PEMS systems for Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV) applications. The main evaluation phase took place between February and June 2016. One Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicle and three vehicles equipped Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) and Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction (SCR) were tested. The key conclusion of the evaluation phase is that PN-PEMS testing for HDV is feasible. However, low ambient temperatures were challenging for the instruments regarding their robustness. Re-testing of the commercial instruments in September with a DPF and SCR equipped vehicle showed {{that most of the}} issues were resolved. The PN-PEMS instruments measurement uncertainty is around 30 % at the moment. Similar uncertainty (35 %) was found when comparing the best performing system with the reference system at <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (CVS); i. e. PEMS method uncertainty. JRC.

40|$|We study, {{experimentally}} and theoretically, {{the dynamics}} of non-volatile particles emitted from a diesel EURO 3 light-duty vehicle along the transfer tube that conducts exhaust fumes from the tailpipe to <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Particle agglomeration, diffusional and thermophoretic transport are modeled. For turbulent, but moderate, Reynolds numbers and under steady-state conditions we map the combustion-generated nanoparticle dynamics onto an one-dimensional dynamics of aerosol particles in an ageing chamber. The aggregate fractal dimension, determined self-consistently by comparing mass distributions, varied from 2 to 2. 3. The relative importance of aerosol processes is estimated by defining appropriate characteristic time scales. Agglomeration and convection by the bulk motion of the fluid are the dominant processes for inlet number concentrations {{of the order of}} 1. 0 e 8 particles/cm 3 and transfer-tube lengths of 6 - 9 m. Thermophoretic losses are calculated to be non-negligible. For modern vehicles with particulate filters agglomeration is estimated to be negligible, whereas thermophoresis may be significant. JRC.

40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), from <b>the</b> full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial flow dilution system (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the raw exhaust, thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for raw exhaust measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for raw exhaust sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure exhaust gas is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out. Finally, expected losses for typical cases are shown.

40|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{introduced}} a limit for non-volatile particle number (PN) emissions > 23 nm from light-duty vehicles and the stated {{intent is to}} implement similar legislation for on-road heavy-duty engines at the next legislative stage. This paper reviews the recent literature regarding the operation-dependent emission of PN from light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines, and the measurement procedure used for regulatory purposes. The repeatability of the PN method is of the order 5 % and higher scatter of the results could easily {{be explained by the}} effect of the vehicles or the aftertreatment devices on the PN emissions (e. g. the fill state of the diesel particulate filters). Reproducibility remains an issue since it may exceed 30 %. These high variability levels are mainly associated with calibration uncertainties of the PN instruments and drifts of the PN systems (especially those of the Particle Number Counters - PNCs) over time. Correlation measurements between <b>the</b> full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnels</b> (Constant Volume Samplers - CVS) and the proportional Partial Flow Dilution Systems (PFDS) showed agreement within 15 % for the PN method down to 1 x 1011 p/kWh. At lower concentrations, the PN background of the CVS and/or the PFDS can result in larger inconsistencies. The filter-based Particulate (matter) Mass (PM) and the PN emissions correlate well down to 1 - 2 mg/km for light-duty vehicles and also 2 - 3 mg/kWh for heavy-duty applications. The correlation improves when only elemental carbon mass is considered: It is relatively good down to 0. 1 - 0. 3 mg/km or mg/kWh; one order of magnitude below the PM levels. JRC.

40|$|Field testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) is {{becoming}} an important regulatory tool to monitor the in-use compliance of large sources like heavy-duty vehicles, construction and agriculture equipment. Legislative research programmes in Europe, United States and Japan are introducing PEMS in the regulations. The current development status of instrumentation and test procedures is mature for gaseous emissions. The most critical issue remains the development of portable PM instruments and the associated protocol. The main objectives of the paper are: To {{provide an overview of}} the on-going regulatory efforts regarding on-board PM measurements both in the European Union and the United States; To review the available portable measurement techniques; To discuss the technical issues related to the development of an official ¿on-board test procedure¿. The discussion and the conclusions will be supported by some findings from the EU-PEMS project and in particular the evaluation of portable instruments under controlled laboratory conditions (i. e. on reference test cycles) and against reference instruments. PM mass measurements were carried out from a Euro III heavy-duty engine. For the filter gravimetric method, the Control Sistem micro-PSS (portable proportional diluter) was compared to the standard gravimetric methods using full <b>dilution</b> within <b>the</b> CVS <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and two laboratory proportional flow sampling systems such as the AVL Smart Sampler (SPC 472) and the Control Sistem PSS- 20. For real-time measurement, the AVL 483 micro soot sensor was also tested in parallel with the gravimetric methods using both full flow and partial flow <b>dilution.</b> <b>The</b> measurements were found to be highly repeatable over the regulatory cycles. Bio-fuel was also used to characterise the instruments in different ranges and its effect upon the black carbon concentration observed. Regarding the development of on-board test procedures, the first findings from tests conducted on city buses will be presented. The main issues related to a less controlled on-board environment (with vibrations, temperature changes) compared to more controlled laboratory conditions will be highlighted. JRC.

40|$|The fractal {{nature of}} diesel exhaust {{aggregates}} has profound implications on their transport and thermal properties. However, {{the measurement of}} the fractal dimension requires sophisticated techniques (see, e. g., Van Gulijk C. et al. (2004) that are not easily available. We propose an algorithm for the self-consistent determination of the average fractal dimension of non-volatile solid particles emitted by light-duty diesel vehicles (Isella et al., 2008). Experimental number distributions are taken from vehicle emission measurements performed at the VELA- 2 laboratories of the Joint Research Centre. Measurements at the inlet and outlet of the transfer tube that conducts exhaust fumes from the vehicle tailpipe to <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> are analyzed. Agglomeration, diffusional and thermophoretic transport {{are considered to be}} the main aerosol dynamical processes. The experimental procedure was chosen to minimize gas-to-particle conversion processes.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of particle emissions from gasoline {{port fuel injection}} engines have not been fully investigated and established in comparison with those from direct-injection spark ignition engines. This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from port fuel injection engines relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from port fuel injection engines analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of dilution tunnel used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new dilution tunnel was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from port fuel injection engines. A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from port fuel injection engines for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a dilution tunnel. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature. The widest variety of particle morphologies, including liquid particles, was observed on the transmission electron microscopy grid from impactor plate A. In addition to soot agglomerates, crystalline particles and salt particles were also seen. In contrast with earlier studies, particle fragmentation was also observed...|$|E
40|$|The study {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of introducing the regulated particle number measurement procedure for the regulation of gasoline vehicles, focusing on the established cut-off size of 23 nm. A range of late technology gasoline vehicles were tested under regulated and unregulated test conditions. The results indicated a distinct emission behavior of Direct Injection Gasolines (G-DI), Port Fuel Injection gasolines (PFI) and Diesels equipped with Particulate Filters (DPF), that differed {{both in terms of}} the absolute levels but also with respect to the fraction of undetected nano-sized non-volatile particles. The latter was found to be around 20 % (based on comparisons with a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) having a 50 % cut-off size at 4. 5 nm) for three G-DI vehicles tested, but ranged between 40 and 70 % for the two PFIs measured. Interestingly, a relatively large fraction of undetected nanosized was also observed for two late technology DPFs, ranging between 30 and 50 %. To a large extent these differences originate from differences in the size distributions and the relatively blunt shape of the counting efficiency curve of PMP compliant CPCs. Under conditions favouring nucleation mode formation in <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> excessive particle concentrations were detected by the low cut-off size CPCs, and especially the one with a d 50 at 4. 5 nm, that could exceed those of the PMP compliant CPC by up to one order of magnitude. However, the concentration of these nano-sized particles was found to decrease with increasing the dilution ratio in the first stage of the Volatile Particle Remover (VPR), indicating that this is rather a volatile artifact possibly originating from re-nucleation of evaporated material downstream of the VPR. The study also investigated the potential offered by a range of available approaches to effectively control particle emissions from G-DIs. These included the use of a Gasoline Particulate Filter (GPF), the introduction of ethanol in the fuel but also an advanced engine concept combining port and direct fuel injection. The GPF system was found to very efficient in controlling particle number emissions under all driving conditions, having no visible impact on carbon dioxide emissions. The use of fuel with hi-ethanol content (75 - 85 %) was also found to be beneficial especially at high engine loads (up to 97 % reduction of non-volatile particle numbers) and during cold start operation (up to 70 % reduction). The tests with the “hybrid” G-DI-PFI vehicle indicated that there exists the potential for significant reduction of PM formation through engine measures. The non-volatile particle number emissions of this vehicle remained below the diesel limit over all hot start tests. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to quantify the emissions from heavy-duty vehicles operating on alternative fuels or advanced fuel blends, often with novel engine technology or aftertreatment. In {{the first year of}} the program West Virginia University (WVU) researchers determined that a transportable chassis dynamometer emissions measurement approach was required so that fleets of trucks and buses did not need to be ferried across the nation to a fixed facility. A Transportable Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratory (Translab) was designed, constructed and verified. This laboratory consisted of a chassis dynamometer semi-trailer and an analytic trailer housing a full scale exhaust <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and sampling system which mimicked closely the system described in the Code of Federal Regulations for engine certification. The Translab was first used to quantify emissions from natural gas and methanol fueled transit buses, and a second Translab unit was constructed to satisfy research demand. Subsequent emissions measurement was performed on trucks and buses using ethanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuel, and biodiesel. A medium-duty chassis dynamometer was also designed and constructed to facilitate research on delivery vehicles in the 10, 000 to 20, 000 lb range. The Translab participated in major programs to evaluate low-sulfur diesel in conjunction with passively regenerating exhaust particulate filtration technology, and substantial reductions in particulate matter were recorded. The researchers also participated in programs to evaluate emissions from advanced natural gas engines with closed loop feedback control. These natural gas engines showed substantially reduced levels of oxides of nitrogen. For all of the trucks and buses characterized, the levels of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and particulate matter were quantified, and in many cases non-regulated species such as aldehydes were also sampled. Particle size was also quantified during selected studies. A laboratory was established at WVU to provide for studies which supported and augmented the Translab research, and to provide for development of superior emissions measurement systems. This laboratory research focused on engine control and fuel sulfur issues. In recent years, as engine and aftertreatment technologies advanced, emissions levels were reduced such that they were at or below the Translab detectable limits, and in the same time frame the US Environmental Protection Agency required improved measurement methodologies for engine emissions certification. To remain current and relevant, the researchers designed a new Translab analytic system, housed in a container which can be transported on a semi-trailer. <b>The</b> new system's <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> flow was designed to use a subsonic venturi with closed loop control of blower speed, and <b>the</b> secondary <b>dilution</b> and particulate matter filter capture were designed to follow new EPA engine certification procedures. A further contribution of the program has been the development of techniques for creating heavy-duty vehicle test schedules, and the creation of schedules to mimic a variety of truck and bus vocations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a wind tunnel study of near-field pollutant dispersion from rooftop emissions of two multiple building configurations. The configurations mainly consisted of an emitting building {{in the presence of}} an upstream and a downstream building. The various parameters that were varied include: stack height (hs), stack location (Xs), spacing between upstream and emitting building (S 1), spacing between downstream and emitting building (S 2) and exhaust momentum ratio (M). Gas concentrations were measured at various building surfaces using a gas chromatograph. <b>The</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>dilutions</b> were also compared to ASHRAE, 2007 and 2011 models. Results show that a taller upstream and a taller downstream building inhibit the plume from dispersing, thereby increasing the pollutant concentrations {{on the roof of the}} emitting building and leeward wall of the upstream building. In general, the spacing between the upstream and emitting buildings, besides the heights of each building were found to be critical parameters influencing the plume characteristics. ASHRAE, 2007 predictions were found to be overly conservative for the isolated building, while ASHRAE, 2011 estimates compared well with experimental data for a few cases. Safe placement of stack and intake on various building surfaces to avoid plume re-ingestion are suggested based on this study...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the particulate formation mechanisms of a single-cylinder direct-injection two-stroke gasoline engine. The engine was tested at four operating points; an idle condition with a highly stratified mixture, a 2000 RPM low load condition operated with an A/F of both 30 : 1 and 15 : 1, and a 2800 RPM moderate load 15 : 1 A/F condition. The engine utilized an air-assist injector that was also used as a N 2 -assist injector to provide a slightly richer local mixture. Propane fuel was also used with the injector to isolate the effects of spray impingement and fuel films. The oil-to-fuel ratio was externally controlled to determine the lube oil effect on particulate matter (PM). A venturi-type mini-dilution tunnel was designed and integrated to sample particulates. It utilized a critical orifice supply that allowed the dilution ratio (DR) to be changed and a case heater to maintain a sampling temperature at the instruments. A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) {{was used to measure}} particulate mass and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used to measure the number-based size distribution. The total particulate mass measured from the TEOM was compared to traditional gravimetric methods utilizing a Teflon filter and found to agree very well. NOx and CO 2 concentration measurements were made in <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{to be used as a}} tracer to determine DR. Lubrication oil consumption (LOC) was found to have a large effect on the PM for this two-stroke engine utilizing a lost oil system. Not only was the lube oil the dominant effect on PM with the normal fuel-to-oil ratio, it was found to have a complex interaction that changed with engine parameters and not just increase the particulate mass by some offset at all conditions. It was therefore determined that the engine would be operated at a low oil-to-fuel ratio comparable to the LOC rates of four-stroke engines (oil sump systems). An interesting trend in particulate mass with injection timing was observed at both stoichiometric operating conditions. A local minimum in particulate mass was found for a fairly retarded injection timing. The size distributions near this local minimum showed that the particulates appeared to change mode. Generally propane injection resulted in a significantly lower particle mass. It was determined, however, that this is not entirely due to spray impingement. The fuel composition was believed to be a significant effect when using propane and accounts for some of the particulate mass difference. Temperature was found to have a significant effect on particle mass. The observed greater particulate mass for air-assist injection over N 2 -assist was likely due to higher incylinder temperatures. Analysis of the size distribution curves suggests that temperature strongly affects the small mode of particles. This corresponds with advanced timings, closer to a homogeneous condition. The local burning zone A/F had a large effect on particulate mass for very rich mixtures (retarded timings). It also has a significant effect on the large particle mode seen in the size distributions, believed to be elemental carbon particles...|$|E
40|$|As diesel PM {{regulation}} {{gets more}} stringent, the current gravimetric method {{which has been}} used for legal determination of PM mass for vehicle emissions will have difficulty accurately quantifying PM mass emissions. Progress in regulating diesel PM emissions by non-gravimetric means has been made in the Europe. The method, so called particle measurement program (PMP) protocol specifies counting solid particles larger than 23 nm. This method has already been adopted for Euro V and VI to regulate light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emissions and it is also expected to be adopted to regulate emissions for aviation section. However, exclusion of sub- 23 nm particles poses some potential issues. In this thesis, the PMP method was investigated with a focus on finding the nature of sub- 23 nm particles which are excluded in the current PMP protocol. A PMP-compliant system, an AVL advanced particle counter (APC) and an alternative volatile particle removal system, a catalytic stripper (CS) were evaluated and compared for measuring solid particle number emissions in chapters 2 and 3. The evaluations and comparisons were conducted using sulfuric acid and hydrocarbon particles as model volatile particles in laboratory tests, and diluted exhaust from a diesel particle filter (DPF) -equipped heavy-duty diesel vehicle operated on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer under steady speed conditions at two different engine loads. Thisstudy also compared particulate matter (PM) mass and particle number (PN) emissions from a heavy-duty diesel vehicle operating over the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and actual on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions, including two uphill (phases 1 and 2) and two downhill (phases 3 and 4) segments. The UDDS and on-road flow-of-traffic tests represent a broader engine operating conditions than those currently certified emissions testing cycles. For the laboratory test, both the APC and CS removed more than 99 % of the volatile particles in terms of PN when using aerosols composed of pure sulfuric acid or hydrocarbons. When using laboratory test aerosols consisting of mixtures of sulfuric acidand hydrocarbons more than 99 % of the particles were removed by the APC but the surviving particles were no longer entirely volatile, with 12 - 14 % being solid. For the chassis dynamometer test, PN emissions of particles between 3 and 10 nm downstream of the APC were 2 and 7 times higher than the PN emissions of particles above 10 nm at the 74 and 26 % engine load, respectively. At the 26 % engine load, PNlevel of the 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were significantly higher than that in <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> demonstrating that the APC was making 3 to 10 nm particles. The PN emissions of 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were related to theheating temperature of the APC evaporation tube, suggesting these particles are artifacts formed by renucleation of semivolatiles. Considerably fewer particles between 3 to 10 nm were seen downstream of the CS for both engine loads due mainly to removal of semivolatile material by the catalytic substrates, although some of this difference could be attributed to diffusion and thermophoretic losses. Chapter 4 provides an evaluation of the nature of sub 23 nm particles downstream of the European PMP methodology with prescribed cycles and on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions. Particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured using two PMP measurement systems in parallel. For this analysis, {{the focus is on the}} real-time results from multiple instruments. The results revealed that a significant fraction of particles downstream of both PMP systems for all tested cycles werebelow 11 nm. The fraction of sub 11 nm particles observed downstream of the PMP system decreased when the overall dilution ratio of one PMP system was increased from 300 to 1500, suggesting those sub 11 nm particles were formed through re-nucleation of semivolatile precursors. When the evaporation tube temperature was increased from 300 to 500 °C, no difference in particle number concentrations was observed, suggesting incomplete evaporation of semivolatile particles did not contribute to those sub 11 nm particles. Particle emissions were about one order of magnitude higher during flow-of-traffic driving along a highway with a steep grade than during the prescribed driving cycles. During the same flow-of-traffic condition, a sudden jump of PMP operationally defined solid particle concentration was observed, while the accumulation mode particle concentrations in the constant volume sampling (CVS) tunnel measured by engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) only showed a slight increase. This discrepancy was attributed to the extensive growth of the re-nucleated particles downstream of the PMP systems. In chapter 5, the PMP system was evaluated over a standard laboratory testing cycle and uphill and downhill on-road, flow-of-traffic driving conditions. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS and on-road tests were more than 6 times lower than the U. S. 2007 heavy-duty PM mass standard. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS fell between those for the uphill and downhill driving on-road driving conditions. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS and downhill on-road driving conditions were 3 times lower than the Euro VI heavy-duty PN limit for transient cycles, while the PN emissions from the uphill on-road driving conditions were 4 to 5 times higher than the Euro VI PN limit. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS (with an average engine load of 38 %) were comparable in magnitude to those for the phase 3 downhill segment (with an aveage engine load of 40 %) of the on-road test, and were 25 % lower than those for the phase 4 downhill segment (with an avearage engine load of 18 %) of the on-road test. The variability of the PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nmranged from 10 to 40 % for the UDDS and on-road tests, comparable to that found in the European PMP study...|$|E

Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), some proven carcinogens, have been found on diesel particulates. The trace level nitro-PAC emissions, such as 1 -nitropyrene and dinitropyrenes, contribute a large proportion of the mutagenicity in the particulates; in the case of 1 -nitropyrene between 10 to 40 % of the total mutagenicity of the particulate has been claimed. The potential health hazards of PAC require the levels and sources of such emissions to be evaluated over a range of speeds and loads. PAC emissions are dependant on the engine specification, such as normally aspirated compared with turbocharged, and the operating conditions (speed and load). The effect of such variables can be determined using emission profiling, in which profiles of the exhaust are compared at varying engine powers. In this way the effect of speed and load on the combustion efficiency can be established. Identification of PAC sources may be further complicated when engine sampling systems, such as the conventional dilution tunnel/filter system, are prone to artefact formation. This is especially relevant to secondary nitro-PAC emissions, which are prone to forming as artefacts of the filter installed in <b>the</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> In this study, organic emission maps were constructed using the unique total exhaust solvent-stripping apparatus (TESSA) developed at the University of Plymouth. TESSA allowed rapid sampling with a minimum potential for artefact formation. The close proximity of TESSA to the engine allowed the role of the combustion chamber in the formation of emissions to be evaluated. Primary organic emissions, such as pyrene, are derived from survival of compounds in the fuel/oil and by combustion generation. Establishment of emission maps for the primary emissions are vital to resolving the formation of secondary emissions, such as 1 -nitropyrene. Profiling of primary emissions sampled 26 different speeds and loads using TESSA (sampling times as low as IS seconds). Following simple work-up, quantification of the o-alkanes was by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection and PAH by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry operated in electron impact mode. Emissions were expressed as a recovery of the compound emitted as a percentage of the same compound entering the chamber in the fuel. The o-alkane and PAH emission maps correlated with the gaseous unburnt hydrocarbon emissions, indicating that fuel survival was an important source of emissions, whereas lubricating oil contributions were minimal. Fuel survival contributions decreased with load; at 1000 rpm the average PAH survival of 0. 95 % at idling decreased to 0. 2 % at full load. High survivals under idling was a consequence of the low chamber temperatures and air:fuel ratios mixed beyond the lean flammability limits, whereas at full load, the high temperatures resulted in the greatest combustion efficiency. The o-alkane emission trends replicated those of PAH; at 1000 rpm the average o-alkane survival was 0. 48 % at idle compared with 0. 084 % at full load. Correlations between the distribution of the emissions and fuel at high load, suggested fuel survival unchanged was responsible. At low loads the exhaust/fuel PAH ratios were more varied, with the range of percentage recoveries at low loads increasing with speed (difference between percentage recovery of fluorene and phenanthrene at idling for 1000 rpm and 3000 rpm was 0. 05 and 0. 18 respectively). At high load, the combustion environment can be envisaged as producing areas under which complete combustion and survival unchanged occur. In between the complete combustion and unburnt fuel zones, a narrow range of temperatures and time for combustion reduce the opportunity for combustion generation reactions and/or preferential survival. Low load at 3000 rpm may increase the intermediate zone, allowing preferential survival and/or combustion generation reactions to evolve. Possible pyrolytic cracking of o-alkanes and demethylation of PAH at low loads and 3000 rpm was evident. The optimum time, swirl, and temperature for efficient combustion at low loads was generated at 2000 rpm to 2500 rpm, whereas at the higher temperatures corresponding to high loads, the effect of speed was much smaller. The primary emissions map show engineering improvements, particularly at low loads, could be implemented to lower the PAH emissions. The correlation between the emissions and fuel input suggest modifications to the PAH content of fuels may lower emissions. The formation of secondary nitro- and oxy-PAC emissions is by transformation of primary emissions. In the case of nitro-PAC, nitration has been proposed to occur by free radical processes between PAH and oxides of nitrogen, NO,, within the chamber and by electrophilic substitution of PAH surviving combustion by nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid, via the nitronium ion. The combustion contribution to nitro-PAC emissions was investigated using an upgraded TESSA system, and 3 speeds at low, mid, and high NO, for each speed were sampled. Following initial extraction, concentration and clean-up of the samples, the nitro-PAC fractions of interest were isolated by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. The nitro-PAC were identified and quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detection, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry operated in the negative ion chemical ionisation mode (the detection limits for both analytical systems was of the order of 40 - 50 pg of nitro-PAC standards injected). The profiling indicated that a proportion of the fuel underwent nitration within the combustion chamber across a range of speeds and loads. The extract concentrations (average of 5. 3 ppm) found in this study were much lower than those previous found (ranging from 55 to 2280 ppm). The majority of the previous studies relied on sampling using dilution tunnel/filter systems, for which post combustion contributions are simulated; suggesting that a major source of nitro-PAC is derived from post-combustion nitration of PAH surviving combustion, some of which may be artefacts of the filter. Different speeds produced different trends for nitro-PAC emissions with respect to engine load. It was not until the high temperature speed of 3500 rpm was reached that both NO, and nitro-PAC increased with load (R-sq= 0. 989 & p= 0. 067 for 1 -nitronaphthalene & NO,). Nitro-PAC emissions at 3500 rpm were primarily the result of combustion chamber nitration of PAH at high NO,. In the case of 1 -nitropyrene, there was strong evidence to support pyrosynthetic contributions to the pyrene mass, which in turn became nitrated. The nitro-PAC emissions at low loads were the result of post-combustion nitration of PAH surviving combustion with the nitronium ion. The correlation of the PAH precursors to nitro-PAC in the fuel and nitro-PAC emissions suggest fuel modifications may to some extent lower the nitro-PAC emissions. The combustion generation of nitro-PAC at high engine powers may require post-combustion after treatment. Perkins Technology, Peterboroug...|$|E
