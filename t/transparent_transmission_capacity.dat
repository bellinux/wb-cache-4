40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{employ a}} {{stochastic}} geometry model {{to analyze the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Decode-and-Forward (DAF) cooperation scheme in an overlaid wireless network where a primary (PR) network and a secondary (SR) network coexist together. The PR users employ DAF scheme and have a higher priority to access the channel, whereas the SR users use only direct transmission. Because of the fact of coexistence, the interference from SR network seriously affects the performance of PR network. Assuming that simultaneous transmitters in both networks are randomly located in space according to Poisson point processes, we develop outage probabilities for both DAF and direct transmission schemes in both deterministic and Rayleigh fading channels. By defining <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> {{in terms of the}} outage probability, a desired data rate and the density of transmissions, we further quantify <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> for both schemes. It shows that the use of cooperative transmission achieves much better reliability and a larger <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> than the use of direct transmission in the PR network. Furthermore, such performance gain can be manipulated to increase the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> of the SR network without deteriorating the performance of the PR network.

40|$|Interference between nodes is a {{critical}} impairment in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This paper studies the role of multiple antennas in mitigating such interference. Specifically, a network is studied in which receivers apply zero-forcing beamforming to cancel the strongest interferers. Assuming a network with Poisson distributed transmitters and independent Rayleigh fading channels, the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> is derived, which gives {{the maximum number of}} successful transmissions per unit area. Mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are applied to obtain the asymptotic <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> scaling and characterize the impact of inaccurate channel state information (CSI). It is shown that, if each node cancels L interferers, the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> decreases as the outage probability to the power of 1 /(L+ 1) as the outage probability vanishes. For fixed outage probability, as L grows, the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> increases as L to the power of (1 - 2 /alpha) where alpha is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, CSI inaccuracy is shown to have no effect on the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> scaling as the outage probability vanishes, provided that the CSI training sequence has an appropriate length, which we derived. Numerical results suggest that canceling merely one interferer by each node increases the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> by an order of magnitude or more, even when the CSI is imperfect.

The <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> framework has been successfully used to characterize the physical layer on the ad hoc networks [15 – 20], such as through the use of multiple antennas [17], interference cancellation [18] and spectrum sharing in tiered cellular networks [20].
