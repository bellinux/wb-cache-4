5|$|Bruce Castle ({{formerly}} the Lordship House) is a Grade I listed 16th-century {{manor house}} in Lordship Lane, Tottenham, London. It {{is named after}} the House of Bruce who formerly owned the land on which it is built. Believed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of an earlier building, about which little is known, the current house {{is one of the}} oldest surviving English brick houses. It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E

He proceeds <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> box, which makes him involuntarily explain the Kauravas' real intentions behind the marriage proposal. Ghatotkacha then reveals his identity. After humiliating the Kauravas, Ghatotkacha sends them back to Hastinapuram. Sasirekha's parents accept her marriage. They thank Ghatotkacha, who credits Krishna as the mastermind behind everything, including Abhimanyu and Sasirekha's marriage.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seashore at Glenelg {{and wait for the}} imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E
5|$|The current castle, {{built in}} stone {{during the reign}} of King Henry II, is on the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A keep used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> motte which is on the south west of the site, {{although}} most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period. In the 17th century the motte was landscaped {{with the addition of a}} path. The bailey was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.|$|E

5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or undecided, to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{coat of arms}} {{depicts the}} old castle that used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of the former prison. The royal purple {{background}} represents Dorchester's status {{as part of the}} monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset {{who took part in the}} Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI. The inscription 'Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre' translates as 'Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester'. The mayor has a similar seal of office, but this has the inscription ' Dorcestriensis Sig : Maioris'.|$|E
5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E

25|$|As with {{conventional}} biplane floatplanes, the torpedo was carried between {{the bottom of}} the fuselage and the floats. Unusually, the aircraft was flown from the rear cockpit, although this did cause a problem for an observer in the front seat. The observer had <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coaming to use the machine-gun, which was level with the top wing. When a torpedo was carried, the aircraft could not fly with an observer at the same time.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the site was used in the early post-Roman period as a British settlement.

Furthermore, Bede records Oswin giving a parcel of land to St Hilda for the foundation of a monastery here in c.647; the present-day church of St Hilda, by the Market Place, is said <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> monastic site.|$|E
