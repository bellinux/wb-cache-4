5|$|Business {{and family}} {{commitments}} kept Rush busy {{for the next}} few years. He moved his home up-river from Maclean to Grafton, the effective 'capital' of <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River district. Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent store, and a riverside villa which he named 'Clarence House'. Rush took an active part in a great many community and sporting organisations. He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office-holder of <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River Jockey Club. He continued to promote and take part in local regattas. One of these was <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River Aquatic Carnival, held on 10 March 1883. The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators. The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £1000 and the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won convincingly. At a banquet later that week, Rush announced his retirement from professional sculling, but in December of that year, he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £400, and lost convincingly. The newspapers praised Rush for his valour, but hinted that it was high time he retired.|$|E

5|$|Rush set {{his sights}} on the Australian Sculling Championship, and in February 1873, won it from William Hickey in a {{controversial}} match: many claimed that Hickey 'sold' the race. Rush insisted that the championship be contested on his home waters of <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River. To make this condition was his right as the holder of a current championship. Rush's enterprise in arranging for sponsors to provide substantial sums of prizes encouraged Australia's best scullers to compete. These events drew large crowds of spectators and gamblers to <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River, especially the town of Grafton. Rush helped to organise, and took part in, aquatic contests held Grafton in 1874, and 1875 Two of these were held in conjunction with Grafton's celebration of the Queen's Birthday. Rush also organised an Intercolonial Regatta, held at Grafton 7 October 1874 at which he successfully defended his championship. However, at the Queen's Birthday regatta of 1875, Rush, who was ill, lost the race to Elias C. Laycock.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger skiff.

5|$|In 1869, Rush won {{the title}} of Champion of <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> from Prospero Coulon. The two men then joined forces as a rowing team and competed at the Anniversary Day Regatta of 26 January 1870 held at Port Jackson. Rush and Coulon contested several events, notably winning the single-scull and pair-oar races, and while the prize money they {{received}} was modest, their performances were noted by Sydney rowers who quickly challenged them to private matches for large stakes. Rush and Coulon remained in Sydney for some months after the January regatta, and continued to win as a team.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River in {{northern}} New South Wales.

Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.|$|E

5|$|Rush {{arrived in}} Sydney in 1861 {{at the age}} of 16, an {{assisted}} immigrant brought to augment Australia's mostly agricultural workforce. Rush was a farm labourer, who knew nothing of boats or boating, but within ten years of his arrival in Australia, Rush was Champion Sculler of <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River, as well as a selector, cattle-raiser and butcher. His interest in the sport of rowing dominated Rush's life, and hampered his prosperity. He repeatedly travelled from his Clarence River home to compete for large money prizes on Sydney's Parramatta River, neglecting his business affairs. Rush became Champion Sculler of Australia in 1873, and defended his championship several times, not always successfully. Rush succeeded on a few occasions in having the Championship venue moved from Sydney to <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River, the first to shift the focus of sculling away from the capital city. From 1874, there was talk of Rush travelling to England to compete for the World Sculling Championship, but this did not eventuate. Instead, Edward Trickett won the World Championship on the Thames in 1876. Rush and Trickett in 1877 competed on the Parramatta River for the World Championship, but Rush lost this race.|$|E

5|$|Bure {{improved}} on {{his rookie}} season in 1992–93 with {{the first of two}} consecutive 60-goal seasons. In the third game of the season, he scored a career-high four goals against the Winnipeg Jets. His three goals and one assist in the second period set a pair of Canucks' records for most goals and points in a period, in addition to the team mark for most goals overall in a game (for which he is tied with several players). Furthermore, Bure scored two of his goals on the penalty kill to set a fourth team record for most short-handed goals in one contest. He appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game in 1993, being named to <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> Campbell Conference Team as the lone Canucks' representative, and scored two goals. Shortly after the All-Star break, Bure established a new franchise record for goals in a season during a 5–1 win over the Quebec Nordiques, surpassing Tony Tanti's 45-goal mark. The next month, on March 1, he reached the 50-goal mark {{for the first time in}} his career, scoring against Grant Fuhr of the Buffalo Sabres in a neutral-site game in Hamilton, Ontario. He also surpassed Patrik Sundström's franchise record of 91 points. Bure finished the season with 110 points in 83 games, and became the first Canuck named to the NHL First All-Star Team. His 110 points stood as the team record until it was broken by Henrik Sedin's 112 points in 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|Edward 'Ned' Trickett {{sought to}} win the Australian Championship from Rush. Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events, but {{afterwards}} competed at numerous regattas and in private matches, and his form was consistently improving. Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey. Rush declined to row anywhere but on <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River, and demanded that the stakes be not less than £500. By 1875, Rush had a wife and five children to support, {{as well as many}} business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issue for nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler. Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia. Rush challenged Trickett for the World title. Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River, and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877.|$|E

Jeffries is also commemorated by photographic portraits in the Abermain Memorial and Citizens' Club and by a carved chair presented to Abermain Holy Trinity Anglican Church by his uncle and aunt in 1918. In 1976, the Jeffries and Currey Memorial Library was opened by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, at Dudley Public School to honour two of the school's pupils who were decorated with the Victoria Cross during the First World War: Clarence Jeffries and William Currey. The pair are also commemorated by the Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries (V.C.) and Pte. William Matthew Currey (V.C.) Memorial Wall located in the grounds of Sandgate General Cemetery, Newcastle, which was unveiled in an official ceremony on 16 April 2000. <b>The</b> <b>Clarence</b> Jeffries Housing Estate at Bullecourt Army Barracks in Adamstown is also named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to New York, Jackson joined the Long Island Antlers Club and resumed {{competitive}} sport shooting, {{as well as his}} career at Sperry's. He was admitted into St. John's University on a shooting scholarship, but declined, and instead entered <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> H. White School of Modern Photography. During his studies he earned a spot on the United States' delegation to shooting at the 1948 Summer Olympics, where he finished 16th in a field of 36 competitors in the 300 metre rifle three positions event. He then took up a job at the Pratt Institute in the photography department and began training for the 1949 ISSF World Shooting Championships, where he won gold in the 50+100 m rifle prone position individual event and silver in the team version. In 1950 he turned down a position as head of promotions at the Winchester Repeating Arms Company so that he could continue competing, with his next international stop being the 1951 Pan American Games. Here he captured the only two gold medals not won by the Argentinians in individual events, the three positions and prone rifle competitions at 50 meters, as well as silver in the high power rifle, three positions at 50 meters tournament. Upon his return, he was ordered to Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, Colorado to join the Radar Photo Interpreters' School. Following graduation, he reported to Strategic Air Command in Roswell, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E
