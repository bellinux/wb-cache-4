500|$|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is {{the first}} English {{language}} film and the first big studio production of Norwegian writer and director Wirkola, {{up to this point}} best known for his 2009 Nazi zombie-themed, independent horror comedy film Dead Snow. Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and they loved it. And <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder how I got this movie made. It’s all across the world now. But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clough {{was still}} a popular choice {{to be given the}} job of England manager before Graham Taylor's {{appointment}} in 1990. Clough himself quipped: [...] "I'm sure the England selectors thought, if <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> on and gave me the job, I'd want to run the show. They were shrewd because that's exactly what I would have done." [...] He has been called the [...] "greatest manager England never had." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{event that}} {{affected}} `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment {{of his father}} when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Bahá'u'lláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál. He described how [...] "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In {{the middle of the}} stairway, {{all of a sudden we}} heard His …voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> back".|$|E
5000|$|... "Life, they wonder, can <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> under? Naw, never that." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{pull the}} wheezy bell of their {{shuttered}} cottage: and wait. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for a dun, peer {{out from a}} coign of vantage.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> out of Congress," [...] Ernest replied coldly, [...] "and put {{me against}} a wall, and blow my brains out--what then?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Kravitz began {{banging on}} {{pots and pans}} in the kitchen, playing them as drums {{at the age of}} three. At the age of five, {{he wanted to be a}} musician. He began playing the drums and soon added guitar. Kravitz grew up {{listening}} to the music his parents listened to: R, jazz, classical, opera, gospel, and blues. [...] "My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to a lot of shows," [...] Kravitz said. Around the age of seven, he saw The Jackson 5 perform at Madison Square Garden, which became his favorite group. His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, Miles Davis and other jazz greats. Ellington even played [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] for him one year when he was about 5. He was exposed to the soul music of Motown, Stax, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Gladys Knight, The Isley Brothers, and Gamble and Huff growing up who were key influences on his musical style. Kravitz often went to see New York theater, where his mother worked. His mother encouraged his dreams of pursuing music.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{down to the}} {{courtyard}} unresisting, where the prison van was standing in waiting.|$|E
60|$|It was {{all said}} in a moment, and <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> between them, wrapped in the cloak.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a walk: though {{tired and}} stiff, To climb the heights I madly agree; And, after a tumble {{or so from}} the cliff, They kindly suggest the Sea.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're overmodest, Alec. If you weren't, {{you might}} be a great man. Now, I make a point of telling my friends that I'm indispensable, and <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> at my word.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{the matter}} with me," [...] she would be crying to herself; [...] "that the very beasts of the field should shun <b>me?</b> Do <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for a gollywog?" ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{and led me}} to {{the royal}} house, and pushed me through the doorway of the great hut.|$|E
60|$|So <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{and led me}} forth. With bowed head I went, looking not up, and yet I {{felt their}} eyes burn upon my face.|$|E
60|$|I was puzzled. I {{had only}} just been {{released}} from the dungeons, and was lying pain-racked in my customary cell, when <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> back to the dungeon.|$|E
6000|$|Some one {{ventured to}} remind him of his dream, but his laugh was ready. [...] "Do <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for a Saxon, to be frighted because an old woman dreams or sneezes?" ...|$|R
2500|$|A Midrash read [...] to say [...] "that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>Me</b> as an offering" [...] {{and thus}} to tell how God gave the Torah to Israel and said to them: [...] "You are taking Me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell him, then, that I {{will not}} stir a foot {{out of this}} house on Thursday, of my own accord. On Thursday I shall be here; and here I will remain all day,--unless <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> hence by force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing to fear!' {{returned}} the old man. 'Nothing to fear if <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> from thee! Nothing to fear if they parted us! Nobody {{is true to}} me. No, not one. Not even Nell!' ...|$|E
60|$|Into {{the vast}} amphitheater <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me,</b> {{stationing}} {{me at the}} extreme end of the arena. The queen came, with her slimy, sickening retinue. The seats were filled. The show was about to commence.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the worst}} of all," [...] he said with slow emphasis. [...] "That's the end. I came to them {{from the other side}} of the earth and <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> and--see what they made of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, then, I will don thy buff {{coat and}} cap of steel, and walk with thy swashing step, and {{whistling}} thy pibroch of 'Broken Bones at Loncarty'; and if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for thee, there dare not {{four of them}} come near me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe thee, Mary. I believe thou'ld {{never do}} me any harm," [...] he repeated, [...] "and if any other would," [...] he added on a bombastic note, [...] "they shall buy it dear, unless <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> sleeping. But I'll never to Craigmillar." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lavender {{went out}} slowly, thinking, [...] "I may perhaps have said more in that {{interview}} than I remember. Next time I really will insist {{on having a}} proof. Or have <b>they</b> <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> for some other public man?" [...] This notion was so disagreeable, however, that he dismissed it, and passed into the street.|$|R
6000|$|VIVIE. Wait a bit. That wasn't the beginning. I {{went up to}} town on an {{invitation}} from some artistic people in Fitzjohn's Avenue: {{one of the girls}} was a Newnham chum. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to the National Gallery-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{consequence}} of these conjoint invitations, I {{spent a week}} with Mr. C. and Mr. W. at Allfoxden house, and during this time, (beside the reading of MS. poems) <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to Linmouth, and Linton, and the Valley of Stones....|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{something}} built to her memory. Such {{a view of}} the river! I was here once before and <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> up there. Everybody who comes here goes and sees Mrs. Arthur de Bever. They ought to have told you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} better. If <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to the prison, I {{will never see}} him again. His eyes would kill me. Do you ever watch him and see the pride that there is in his eye? He has never yet known what disgrace means; and now I, his mother, have brought him to this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they had}} eaten, {{he said to}} Scorrier: [...] "It was kind {{of you to come}} and stand by <b>me!</b> <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for a god, poor {{creature}} that I am. But shall I ever get the men down again? Their nerve's shaken. I wish I were one of those poor lads, to die with a smile like that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You think you're kiddin' me, don't you? But I {{might even}} do that, if I wanted to," [...] he asserted, glaring {{at her as}} if he {{challenged}} contradiction. [...] "It ain't money that stops me, but hotel keepin' is a dog's life. I've made a bid for a cigar-store down the street, an' if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> up, somebody can have this job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my husband,--he's a blacksmith. Mas'r gen'ly {{hired him}} out. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> off so quick, I didn't even {{have time to}} see him; and I's got four children. O, dear me!" [...] said the woman, {{covering}} {{her face with her}} hands.|$|E
60|$|The Sagoths {{scratched}} their heads. This {{was a new}} one on them, and so being stupid brutes <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{to their}} masters whom they felt would be better fitted to solve the riddle of my return, for riddle they still considered it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was through}} {{me that they}} {{recognized}} you, sahib," [...] Abdool said. [...] "They seized me before they entered your hut, and tied a bandage round my mouth, to prevent my giving any alarm. As <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> out into the road, one of them said: ...|$|E
5000|$|You {{must not}} forget that I am quite homeless. I cannot reach Germany. We possess no other secure harbor. I must fight {{my way through the}} seas of the world doing as much {{mischief}} as can, until my ammunition is exhausted, or a foe far superior in power succeeds in catching me. But it will cost the wretches dearly before <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it a Plenipotentiary or a furrin' Prime Minister <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for?" [...] {{he muttered}} to himself over a mild cigar {{of the finest}} quality, [...] "or mayhap they think I'm a Prince in {{disguise}}! But then a man in disguise ain't known, and therefore can't be follered, or, if he was, {{what would be the}} use of his disguise? No, I can't make it out, no'ow." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> {{and tied}} <b>me</b> to a butcher post.|$|R
