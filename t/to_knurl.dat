50|$|Firan swore {{allegiance}} to the distant Malachite Throne of the Great Kingdom, but conducted many unsanctioned military campaigns against the surrounding tribes, adding handsomely <b>to</b> <b>Knurl's</b> holdings. His reign was marked by prosperity and growth, but also by violence and dissent from the conquered tribes.|$|R
50|$|The term stipple {{can also}} apply to a random pattern of small {{depressions}} applied to a surface to increase the friction and make the surface easier to grip. This process is similar <b>to</b> <b>knurling</b> or checkering, but is often used on complex curved surfaces, such as anatomical grips, where a regular pattern would not fit. Stippling can be cast into plastic objects, or applied with a hammer and punch to wood or metal objects.|$|R
50|$|As of December 5, 2008 the Standard P-Bass {{has been}} updated with CBS era-style decals, a 3-ply {{parchment}} pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard. Other features include a split-coil hum-cancelling pickup {{and a return}} <b>to</b> the <b>knurled</b> chrome flat-top control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with aged white Stratocaster control knobs.|$|R

Blinded by his hopes for restoring his son, Azal'Lan went forth with a small retinue of guards, and was then ambushed by a group of mercenaries. Fleeing their pursuit, he entered a dense fog to lose them. He was never <b>to</b> see <b>Knurl</b> again.|$|R

25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar <b>to</b> <b>knurling.</b> These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|R
50|$|Knurl point screws are {{generally}} used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the knurl cup set screw helps reduce loosening due <b>to</b> vibration. The <b>knurled</b> point combines digging {{action of the}} cup point with counter-clockwise locking knurls that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.|$|R
50|$|On {{the edge}} of the US dime, quarter and half dollar, and many world coins there are ridges, similar <b>to</b> <b>knurling,</b> called reeds. Some older US coins, and many world coins have other designs on {{the edge of}} the coin. Sometimes these are simple designs like vines, more complex bar {{patterns}} or perhaps a phrase, as on the United States dollar coin, on which are the date, mintmark, and motto, E Pluribus Unum. Historically these kinds of designs are imparted into the coin through a multisectioned third die called a collar, whose inner edge diameter is the same as that of {{the edge of the}} coin. When the obverse and reverse dies strike the planchet the planchet expands to fill the collar, impressing the collar design into the edge of the coin. The collar sections are then separated to allow the coin to be removed. When the collar is missing, it results in a type of error called a broadstrike. A broadstruck coin is generally a bit flatter and quite a bit bigger around than the regular non-error coin of the same denomination. A second and faster process by which a design is applied to the edge of a coin is by use of an edge incusing machine. The struck coin is feed into the machine and the machine then pressed the design into the edge of the coin. Sometimes a mint will use both methods to apply an edge design. The U.S. Mint, for example, used an edge incusing machine to letter the edges business strike presidential dollars and a collar for the proof versions of these coins.|$|R
50|$|Cam {{fasteners}} are {{a simple}} type of fastener that use a cam to push {{down on the}} webbing that is passed through the cam and prevent the webbing from slipping back through the fastener. The edge of the cam lever that faces the webbing is usually <b>knurled</b> <b>to</b> provide a firmer grip on the webbing. Tension is added by pulling the excess webbing through the fastener until the necessary tension is achieved and then releasing the cam lever to lock the webbing in place.|$|R
5000|$|Adjustable {{dumbbells}} {{consist of}} a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern (<b>knurling)</b> <b>to</b> improve grip. Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown to the right is a [...] "spinlock" [...] dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar. Nowadays, many commercially sold dumbbells are available with sophisticated, and easy-to-use methods for weight increments adjustments.|$|R
2500|$|In the 21st {{century and}} at least until 2010, the Japanese company Clover was {{producing}} the bright green pendant Mini Kacha-Kacha which is designed like a hand-held mechanical tally counter, but is oriented upside-down on a neck pendant for easy reading by the user. It has a button to advance the numbers singly, access <b>to</b> the <b>knurled</b> number rings for adjustment of numbers, and a lock to prevent interference by the user dropping the gadget or by children playing with it. On this type of gadget it has been possible for the manufacturer to make the numbers larger and therefore easier to read than on the on-needle counter, which needs to be small. [...] In August 2007 the UK magazine Simply Knitting no.32 gave away a free pendant knitting counter in a form of a white sheep, and in June 2010 the same magazine no.67 gave away another one {{in the shape of}} a yellow flower. Unfortunately the numerals on the yellow flower version were oriented incorrectly, causing inconvenience for the wearer of the pendant.|$|R
50|$|The {{second type}} of captive nut is a {{threaded}} insert. These are either pressed into holes in the material to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally <b>knurled</b> <b>to</b> get a good grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that {{are too thin to}} be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{optimise}} the design of a milling machine control knob which is found to be difficult to operate. The independent variables include body positions, arm positions, finger positions, torque direction and tactile sensation. The size of the finger is also taken into account for designing the knob. The early study includes the feedbacks and data collections directly from the industrial manual workers from 8 manufacturing firms on the preference of body positions, arm positions, finger positions and the designs of knobs. The collected data were analysed via multiple regression analysis using Minitab 16 statistical software and narrowed down into three levels per variable. A number of shapes were selected based on literatures and this amount was reduced <b>to</b> one shape (<b>knurled</b> spherical knob) based on the survey and observational studies...|$|R
40|$|After enzymatic {{dispersion}} {{of the muscle}} of the guinea-pig gastric fundus, single elongated cells were observed which differed from archetypal smooth muscle cells due <b>to</b> their <b>knurled,</b> tuberose or otherwise irregular surface morphology. These, but not archetypal smooth muscle cells, consistently displayed spontaneous localized (i. e. non-propagating) intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) release events. Such calcium events were novel in their magnitude and kinetic profiles. They included short transient events, plateau events and events which coalesced spatially or temporally (compound events). Quantitative analysis of the events with an automatic detection programme showed that their spatio-temporal characteristics (full width and full duration at half-maximum amplitude) were approximately exponentially distributed. Their amplitude distribution suggested the presence of two release modes. Carbachol application caused an initial cell-wide calcium transient followed {{by an increase in}} localized calcium release events. Pharmacological analysis suggested that localized calcium release was largely dependent on external calcium entry acting on both inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP 3 Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to release stored calcium. Nominally calcium-free external solution immediately and reversibly abolished all localized calcium release without blocking the initial transient calcium release response to carbachol. This was inhibited by 2 -APB (100 μm), ryanodine (10 or 50 μm) or U- 73122 (1 μm). 2 -APB (100 μm), xestospongin C (XeC, 10 μm) or U- 73122 (1 μm) blocked both spontaneous localized calcium release and localized release stimulated by 10 μm carbachol. Ryanodine (50 μm) also inhibited spontaneous release, but enhanced localized release in response to carbachol. This study represents the first characterization of localized calcium release events in cells from the gastric fundus...|$|R
40|$|Relevant {{scientific}} and technical problems in relation to mechanical engineering is development of new technological processes that {{make it possible to}} achieve high accuracy and durability of machine parts that meet the requirements imposed on them. So it is important to develop a new method to make a flat gear teeth by plastic deformation of the ingot. The article deals with the actual problem of improving productivity and quality of plane wheels teeth that are widely used in advanced wave, planetary and other transmissions. A progressive method to produce flat gear teeth gear by plastic deformation of the ingot with two knurl rollers alternately moving reciprocally in the direction not intersecting the axis of the ingot mounting surface has been described in the article. The working surface of the rollers corresponds to the resulting shape of the teeth. The schemes of the teeth installing and knurling have been shown. The necessary material and the heat treatment of the knurling tools have been described.  Its use will significantly increase the wear resistance of the working surfaces of the teeth and their durability as well as to increase productivity and its manufacturing costs. The material of the rollers is BC 15 steel. The surface layer of the knurling tools was subjected to nitration, surface hardness being up <b>to</b> 65 HRC. <b>Knurling</b> is made in the 5236 P shaper suited for this purpos...|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench <b>to</b> an externally <b>knurled,</b> internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
