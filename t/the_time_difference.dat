5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the {{response}} is received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the {{response}} is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages to make up <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference,</b> which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses {{at the finish line}} in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the Jovian {{satellite}} eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's longitude upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as Greenwich), <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15° around the Earth's equator.

40|$|With the {{development}} of numerous satellite navigation systems, there has been growing interest in {{the development}} of system independent receivers. However, one of the problems encountered is in <b>the</b> different <b>time</b> systems employed by each of the satellite navigation systems. Consequently, it has become standard practice to solve for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> within <b>the</b> receiver’s navigation solution. However, there are several ways of solving for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> and some doubt exists about their equivalence. Nevertheless to enhance interoperability and to enable a position to be obtained with any four satellites, satellite navigation system providers are intending to measure and transmit <b>the</b> <b>time</b> offsets to other <b>time</b> systems. <b>The</b> broadcast <b>time</b> offsets though are imprecise and cannot be applied as error less corrections. Consequently, numerous methods of employing <b>the</b> broadcast <b>time</b> offsets have been developed that account for their imprecision. While it is clear that <b>the</b> measured <b>time</b> offsets should be employed when a position would otherwise not be obtained, there is doubt surrounding whether or not <b>the</b> broadcast <b>time</b> offsets should always be employed. Hence, this paper initially proves that a number of methods of solving for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> are mathematically equivalent. Likewise, it is also proven that a number of the methods of accounting for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>differences</b> with <b>the</b> broadcast <b>time</b> offsets are mathematically equivalent.

25|$|To create {{accurate}} maps, {{latitude and}} longitude must be accurately determined. Navigators {{had been able to}} work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a backstaff or quadrant. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> between points {{on the surface of the}} earth.

Hence, {{there should be a}} difference of about 7minutes between the periods of Io measured at the first quadrature and those measured at the second quadrature. In practice, no difference is observed at all, from which Rømer concludes that the speed of light must be very much greater than one Earth-diameter per second.|$|E
25|$|Photoinhibition {{can also}} be induced with short flashes of light using either a pulsed laser or a xenon flash lamp.

The interpretation has been criticized by noting that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon flashes depends on the energy of the flashes even if such strong flashes are used that they would saturate the formation of the substrate of the recombination reactions.|$|E

They pass a point at different instants in time. But <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference</b> (phase difference) between them is a constant - same for every pass since they are at the same speed and in the same direction.

25|$|Active sonar is {{also used}} to measure {{distance}} through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>difference,</b> scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.|$|E
