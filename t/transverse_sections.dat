500|$|Relative {{to other}} typical {{mushroom}} species, the spores of V.bohemica are huge, typically measuring 60–80 by 15–18µm. They are elliptical, smooth, sometimes curved, and appear hyaline (translucent) [...] to yellowish. The spores, which number two (more rarely three) per ascus are characteristic for this species. The smooth, elliptical asci measure 275–350µm long by 16–23µm wide. The British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller {{determined that the}} asci are heliotropic—they bend toward light. As he noted, [...] "I cut <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> though their pilei, examined these sections under the microscope, and at once perceived that in all the hymenial grooves and depressions the asci were curved outwards so that their opercula must have faced the strongest rays of light to which {{the ends of the}} asci has been subjected in the places where the fruit-bodies developed." [...] This response to the stimulus of light is significant because it permits a fruit body to point and later discharge its asci towards open spaces, thus increasing the chances that the spores will be dispersed by wind. The paraphyses are thick and club-shaped, with diameters of 7–8µm at their tips.|$|E

[...] From this last expression for the curvature, {{it is seen}} to vanish identically if, and only if, the horizontal subbundle is Frobenius integrable. [...] Thus the curvature is the integrability condition for the horizontal subbundle to yield <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> of the fiber bundle E → M.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} explain how he visualised the courses of {{voussoirs}} in a stone skew arch, Fox wrote, [...] "The principle which I have adopted is, to work the stones {{in the form of}} a spiral quadrilateral solid, wrapped round a cylinder, or, in plainer language, the principle of a square threaded screw: hence it becomes quite evident, that the <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> of all these spiral stones are the same throughout the whole arch. It will be obvious, that the beds of the stones should be worked into true spiral [...] planes." [...] So, a stone skew arch built to Fox's plan would have its voussoirs cut with a slight twist, in order to follow the shape of a square threaded screw.|$|E

2500|$|Striae of Retzius are {{incremental}} {{lines that}} appear brown in a stained section of mature enamel. These lines {{are composed of}} bands or cross striations on the enamel rods that, when combined in longitudinal sections, seem to traverse the enamel rods. [...] Formed from changes in diameter of Tomes’ processes, these incremental lines demonstrate the growth of enamel, similar to the annual rings on a tree on <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> of enamel. The exact mechanism that produces these lines is still being debated. Some researchers hypothesize that the lines {{are a result of}} the diurnal (circadian), or 24-hour, metabolic rhythm of the ameloblasts producing the enamel matrix, which consists of an active secretory work period followed by an inactive rest period during tooth development. Thus, each band on the enamel rod demonstrates the work/rest pattern of the ameloblasts that generally occurs over a span of a week.|$|E
2500|$|Pulvinar means pillow in Latin. It {{constitutes}} the posterior pole of the thalamus and its posterior border is indeed smooth. Anteriorly {{there is only}} an incomplete boundary with the medial nucleus. The two have in fact common connections both thalamocortical and corticothalamic. This {{is the case for}} instance for the frontal cortex. The usual subdivisions do not fit with the distribution of cortical afferent. It is common to find the description of a [...] "nucleus lateralis posterior ( [...] LP). This is simply a part of the pulvinar passing over the lateral region and giving in <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> the image of a ventral and a dorsal (or lateral) subdivision. Sagittal sections show that the pulvinar(LP) ensemble is a single curved entity. The whole receives in the same almost identical afferences. A main medial part receives flat islands of axonal terminations from the frontal, parietal, temporal and preoccipital cortex. Only one part of the pulvinar is particular, the intergeniculate or inferior pulvinar, which receives tectal afferents and which has a visuotopic map.|$|E
2500|$|Thalamic regions may be {{functionally}} inhomogeneous. The {{elements of}} the lateral region have been frequently separated into ventral and dorsal (in fact named lateral) nuclei. This subdivision no more hold true. Cytoarchitectonics have partly failed. What differentiates anatomofunctional parts are the major afferent systems present in the thalamus as terminal parts of axons and axonal arborisations. Three-dimensional analyses {{of the distribution of}} all the axonal ending coming from the same source show that they occupy together an own space in the thalamus, which is called a territory. Such a main territory do no mix or overlap in primates with neighbouring territories (Percheron et al. 1998). This is what made possible a solid partition of the thalamus. These territories may cover one or several nuclei. The analyses of the three-dimensional geometry of the main afferent territories in macaques have shown that a dorsal element on <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> is simply the posterior part of the preceding territory. There are thus no [...] "dorsal nuclei". This is one reason why the nomenclature selected by the Nomina anatomica and the Terminologia Anatomica (1998) is hardly applicable. The evolution of the thalamus follows that of the cortex and there are differences including between primates (new world monkeys and old world; old world and humans), which means that a universal nomenclature valid in all species is not simply reachable.|$|E

60|$|The lava where {{first met}} with is 130 feet in thickness: it there {{consists}} of two, three, or perhaps more streams, divided {{from each other}} by vesicular spheroids like those on the surface.

Generally {{the surface of the}} basalt is smooth them in one part high up the valley, it was so uneven and hummocky, that until I afterwards saw the streams extending continuously {{on both sides of the}} valley up to a height of about three thousand feet close to the Cordillera, I thought that the craters of eruption were probably close at hand. This hummocky surface I believe to have been caused by the crossing and heaping up of different streams. In one place, there were several rounded ridges about twenty feet in height, some of them as broad as high, and some broader, which certainly had been formed whilst the lava was fluid, for in <b>transverse</b> <b>sections</b> each ridge was seen to be concentrically laminated, and to be composed of imperfect columns radiating from common centres, like the spokes of wheels.|$|E

One specimen should then be pinned out in the dissecting dish, ventral side uppermost, and the atrium opened to expose liver and pharynx. A part of the pharynx may be examined with the low power to see the form of the gill slits. The second specimen should be soaked in turpentine for some time, and then dropped into melted paraffin wax. <b>Transverse</b> <b>sections</b> may then be cut with a razor, the paraffin wax removed from these by solution in turpentine, the turpentine in its turn dissolved out by alcohol, and the sections, after immersion in oil of cloves, may be transferred to Canada balsam for examination and preservation.

The {{internal}} skeleton, {{as we have}} said, {{is entirely}} cartilaginous, and only those parts which are pre-formed in cartilage in the skeletons of the higher types are represented here.

The neural arch above the centrum, and containing the spinal cord, is made up of neural plates (n.p.), and interneural plates (i.n.p.), completed above by a median neural spine (n.s.). In the caudal region, instead of ribs projecting outwardly, there are haemal processes, inclined downwards and meeting below, forming an arch, the haemal arch, containing the caudal artery and vein-- the vein ventral to the artery-- and resembling the neural arch, which contains the spinal cord above, in shape and size.|$|E
