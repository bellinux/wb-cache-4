5|$|Development of Virtue's Last Reward {{began on}} the Nintendo DS, but this changed early in {{production}} following {{the announcement of the}} Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. The development team at Chunsoft wanted to utilize <b>the</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> (3D) features of the newer systems, and changed production of the game to the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. As neither system had been released yet, the team was under the assumption that the 3D features would require 3D character models. Uchikoshi later remarked that designing 3D character models proved to be a challenge for Chunsoft due to company's inexperience with 3D effects.|$|E
5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses <b>the</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E

The player directly controls Nier through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. <b>The</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can move freely throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders.

In addition to the single-player mode, the game features cooperative (co-op) multiplayer. Activated through wireless connection, up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons.|$|E

5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about <b>the</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose <b>the</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E
