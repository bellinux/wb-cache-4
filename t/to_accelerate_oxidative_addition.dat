50|$|Lithium {{chloride}} {{has been}} found to be a powerful rate accelerant in cases where the X group dissociates off of the palladium (i.e. the open mechanism). The chloride ion is believed to either displace the X group on the palladium making the catalyst more active for transmetalation or by coordination to the Pd(0) adduct <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition.</b> Also, LiCl salt enhances the polarity of the solvent, making it easier for this normally anionic ligand (-Cl, -Br, -OTf, etc.) to leave. This additive is necessary when a solvent like THF is used; however, utilization of a more polar solvent, such as NMP, can replace the need for this salt additive. However, when the coupling's transmetalation step proceeds via the cyclic mechanism, addition of lithium chloride can actually decrease the rate. As in the cyclic mechanism, a neutral ligand, such as phosphine, must dissociate instead of the anionic X group.|$|R

Because of their unique electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties, carbon nanotubes are important for novel applications in the electronics, aerospace, and computer industries. Exposure to graphite and carbon materials {{has been associated with}} increased incidence of skin diseases, such as carbon fiber dermatitis, hyperkeratosis, and naevi. We investigated adverse effects of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) using a cell culture of immortalized human epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT). After 18 h of exposure of HaCaT to SWCNT, oxidative stress and cellular toxicity were indicated by formation of free radicals, accumulation of peroxidative products, antioxidant depletion, and loss of cell viability. Exposure to SWCNT also resulted in ultrastructural and morphological changes in cultured skin cells.

We were able to selectively buffer mitochondrial Ca(2 +) rises by targeting the Ca(2 +) -binding protein S 100 G to the matrix. We find that matrix Ca(2 +) controls signal-dependent NAD(P) H formation, respiration, and ATP changes in intact cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that matrix Ca(2 +) increases are necessary for the amplification of sustained glucose-dependent insulin secretion in β cells. Through the regulation of NAD(P) H in adrenal glomerulosa cells, matrix Ca(2 +) also acts as a positive signal in reductive biosynthesis, which stimulates aldosterone secretion.

We have, therefore, studied the influence of phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of oral cyclosporin in six healthy male subjects. Cyclosporin concentrations in serum and whole blood were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Concentrations of cyclosporin in whole blood were consistently higher than corresponding values in serum. Concentrations of cyclosporin determined by RIA were also consistently higher than those determined by h. p. l. c. Irrespective of the biological fluid (serum or whole blood) or the type of drug analysis (h. p. l. c. or RIA), changes in cyclosporin kinetics following phenytoin administration exhibited similar patterns. Phenytoin significantly reduced the maximum concentration and the area under the concentration-time curve and significantly increased total body clearance of cyclosporin. There was a statistically significant reduction of cyclosporin half-life (t 1 / 2) in whole blood using h. p. l. c. analysis. However, {{there was no significant}} change in cyclosporin t 1 / 2 in serum following phenytoin administration, using either form of drug analysis. Cyclosporin metabolites 17 and 18 were measured by h. p. l. c. in whole blood samples only, since these metabolites were found almost entirely in red blood cells. Phenytoin significantly reduced the Cmax and AUC of both metabolites, but no significant change was observed in the t 1 / 2 of either. Phenytoin enhanced the metabolism of antipyrine which was co-administered with cyclosporin to assess oxidative enzyme activity.

Surface water percolating through fractures in the residual pyrite ore body that forms {{the roof of the}} mine becomes extremely acidic and iron-enriched due <b>to</b> microbially <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidative</b> dissolution of the sulfide mineral. Water droplets on the mine roof were found to host a very limited diversity of exclusively autotrophic microorganisms, dominated by the recently described psychrotolerant iron/sulfur-oxidizing acidophile Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, and smaller numbers of iron-oxidizing Leptospirillum ferrooxidans. In contrast, flowing water within the mine chamber was colonized with vast macroscopic microbial growths, in the form of acid streamers and microbial stalactites, where the dominant microorganisms were Betaproteobacteria (autotrophic iron oxidizers such as â��Ferrovum myxofaciensâ�� and a bacterium related to Gallionella ferruginea). An isolated pool within the mine showed some similarity (although greater biodiversity) to the roof droplets, and was the only site where archaea were relatively abundant. Bacteria not previously associated with extremely acidic, metal-rich environments (a Sphingomonas sp. and Ralstonia pickettii) were found within the abandoned mine. Data supported the hypothesis that the Cae Coch ecosystem is underpinned by acidophilic, mostly autotrophic, bacteria that use ferrous iron present in the pyrite ore body as their source of energy, with a limited role for sulfur-based autotrophy.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{debilitating}} disease affecting the joints such as hips, knees, and shoulders. It involves {{degradation of the}} cartilage tissue and is generally irreversible given the limited self-repair mechanisms of cartilage. To aid in preservation of cartilage, the body produces lubricin - a natural boundary lubricant that binds the surface of cartilage and protects it against wear. In rat models of OA, supplementation of lubricin {{has been shown to}} prevent OA disease progression. In OA joints, production of lubricin is impaired and the mass production of lubricin has proven difficult and infeasbile. However, biomimicry can allow us to design, via synthetic routes, molecules that can have the same functionality of lubricin in the joints. Following the hypothesis that lubricin's boundary lubricating properties are tied to its structure, it is possible to apply biomimetic design criteria to create synthetic lubricin-like molecules. In this work, a combinatorial library of polymer brushes composed of poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are synthesized to mimic the structure and function of lubricin and to screen for how several parameters influence function. The parameters involve different molecular weights of pAA and PEG as well as grafting ratios (PEG:AA). The pAA was synthesized via RAFT polymerization and PEG was conjugated via condensation chemistry at the given grafting ratios. The resulting 27 polymers are called poly(acrylic acid) -graft-poly(ethylene glycol) (pAA-g-PEG). The stability of these polymers was tested to determine ideal storage conditions and potential degradation products in what is called a forced degradation study. Here the polymers are subjected <b>to</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidative</b> and hydrolytic (acidic and basic) conditions. The results demonstrate resistance to hydrolysis but prone to oxidation especially of the PEG component. To characterize the pAA-g-PEG's, a novel method involving Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and either single value decomposition (SVD) or partial least squares (PLS) modeling was employed. The hypothesis is that the FTIR spectra of pAA-gPEG is a composition of pure pAA and PEG spectra. A series of known mass mixtures of pAA and PEG were spun coated on CaF 2 slides and their spectra captured. They were then decomposed in Matlab either through SVD or PLS and compared to their known pAA mass fractions in a calibration graph. Decomposed pAA-g-PEG spectra were then be compared to this graph to determine pAA mass fraction and percent conjugation of PEG side chains. However, the results demonstrated effectiveness only for lower grafting ratios (0. 5 and 0. 25) but were ineffective for the highest grafting ratio of 2. Finally, the evaluation of pAA-g-PEG's as boundary lubricants were done in vitro on bovine cartilage explants and in vivo on rat models of OA. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, pAA(60) - 2 -PEG(2) (60, 000 g/mol pAA; grafting ratio 2; 2, 000 g/mol PEG), demonstrated the greatest reduction in coefficient of friction compared to negative controls. In vitro binding time constant (~ 20 minutes) was much less than synovial clearance time (~ 5 hours). In vivo studies also showed through histological analysis chondroprotection of cartilage in OA rats compared to controls, meaning it protected against OA disease progression. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R

Cycling of iron has been demonstrated in vitro using both pure and mixed cultures of acidophiles, and there is considerable evidence that active cycling of iron occurs in acid mine drainage streams, pit lakes, and iron-rich acidic rivers, such as the Rio Tinto. Measurements of specific rates of iron oxidation and reduction by acidophilic microorganisms show that {{different species}} vary in their capacities for iron oxido-reduction, {{and that this is}} influenced by the electron donor provided and growth conditions used. These measurements, and comparison with corresponding data for oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, also help explain why ferrous iron is usually used preferentially as an electron donor by acidophiles that can oxidize both iron and sulfur, even though the energy yield from oxidizing iron is much smaller than that available from sulfur oxidation. Iron-oxidizing acidophiles have been used in biomining (a technology that harness their abilities <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> the <b>oxidative</b> dissolution of sulfidic minerals and thereby facilitate the extraction of precious and base metals) for several decades. More recently they have also been used to simultaneously remediate iron-contaminated surface and ground waters and produce a useful mineral by-product (schwertmannite). Bioprocessing of oxidized mineral ores using acidophiles that catalyze the reductive dissolution of ferric iron minerals such as goethite has also recently been demonstrated, and new biomining technologies based on this approach are being developed...|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} is {{a significant}} issue in the food industry, which can cause severe food quality deteriorations and nutrition losses. Transition metals, especially iron, are a main factor <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> lipid <b>oxidative</b> reactions in food systems. Non-migratory active packaging techniques provide an alternative strategy to food preservations {{without the need for}} food additives. The objective of this work was to develop non-migratory metal chelating active packaging films to control the iron-promoted lipid oxidation in food products. Both 2 ̆ 2 grafting to 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 grafting from 2 ̆ 2 techniques were used to introduce metal chelating polymer poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) onto inert packaging film surfaces. Compared to the 2 ̆ 2 grafting to 2 ̆ 2 approach, graft polymerization of PAA yielded a higher available carboxylic acid density on the packaging film surface, with a stronger chelating activity toward both Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +. Compared to the native polypropylene (PP) film, the PP- g -PAA film prepared by the 2 ̆ 2 grafting from 2 ̆ 2 approach significantly delayed the lipid oxidation in an oil-in-water emulsion system by a factor of 4 5 times at pH 7. 0. PP-g -PAA films equally inhibited lipid oxidation throughout the range of surface area-to-product volume (SA/V) ratios tested (2 to 8 cm 2 /mL), and were most capable of preventing lipid oxidation in foods at pH values of 5. 0 and higher. A siderophore-mimetic poly(hydroxamic acid) (PHA) was grafted from PP film surface to mimic the chelating property of siderophores, naturally occurring small molecules with high specificity and affinity toward Fe 3 +. The PHA showed a broad active pH range, which retained 50...|$|R
