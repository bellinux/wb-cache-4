5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public <b>transport</b> <b>station</b> on 1 February 1923, when the then {{single-track}} Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The line was built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the line was rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, the line was extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with double track. In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not all at the same time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{feasibility}} studies saw the possible terminus {{of a new}} Waitematā Harbour Crossing (possibly as a tunnel) at Wynyard Point. These have now been shelved by Transit New Zealand, with one remaining option being a longer tunnel to surface near Fanshawe Street or further south along Cook Street, possibly with an underground public <b>transport</b> <b>station</b> somewhere underneath the Tank Farm. A less likely option has also been proposed by Mike Lee, Auckland Regional Council chairman, who suggested a tunnel underneath the Auckland CBD to emerge east of the city centre at Stanley Street, thus avoiding the Central Motorway Junction and city centre traffic.|$|E

500|$|Another {{portion of}} the agreement, point #10, stated that the German command would ensure the {{preservation}} of remaining public and private property {{as well as the}} evacuation or protection of objects and buildings of [...] "artistic, cultural or sacred value". However, soon after the fighting was over at a conference held on October 9, 1944, Heinrich Himmler, Reichsführer of the SS, ordered the total destruction of the city. Himmler stated: [...] "The city must completely disappear {{from the surface of the}} earth and serve only as a <b>transport</b> <b>station</b> for the Wehrmacht. No stone can remain standing. Every building must be razed to its foundation." [...] The task of carrying out the destruction was assigned to SS-Brigadeführer Paul Otto Geibel. Subsequently, the buildings of the city were systematically reduced to ruin, one by one.|$|E
2500|$|Systems for {{identifying}} units and organizations {{assigned to the}} airlift changed several times between 1942 and 1945. The final change occurred on 1 August 1944 when the Air Transport Command discontinued the use of station numbers to identify its units and designated them as numbered [...] "AAF Base Units" [...] with parenthetical modifiers describing their function. AAF base units collectively identified all permanent party organizations, including flying units, at any particular non-combat base. The flying units were commonly denoted as lettered squadrons, i.e. [...] "Squadron B," [...] within the Base Unit. To illustrate the various organizational changes affecting the India-China airlift, the unit at Chabua under 10AF deployed overseas as the 1st Ferrying Group. It was redesignated the 1st Transport Group on 1 December 1942 to denote {{that it was an}} ATC unit. Next it became Station No. 6 (APO 629 New York) on 1 December 1943 when for flexibility ATC no longer fielded groups or squadrons as units. Finally it became the 1333rd AAF Base Unit (Foreign <b>Transport</b> <b>Station)</b> on 1 August 1944 in conformance with AAF policy service-wide. Similarly, Headquarters Squadron, Eastern Sector, India-China Wing, established at Chabua on 16 September 1943 to administer the headquarters of the airlift, was redesignated the Headquarters Squadron, Assam Wing on 1 July 1944 when ATC reorganized itself into [...] "divisions" [...] and [...] "wings"; and Squadron A, 1325th AAF Base Unit (HQ Assam Wing) on 1 August 1944.|$|E
