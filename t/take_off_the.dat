5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat before or after the dive. This helps the diver to put on or <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|The General Staff {{issued an}} order to attack the Egyptian {{positions}} with a force three battalions strong (from the Givati and Palmach's Negev brigades). The attack was meant to {{take place on the}} night of June 1–2, and at about midnight the units involved took up positions from which the assault was meant to <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> 51st Battalion set up positions in the Yavne–Gan Yavne–Hatzor area, the 53rd Battalion—in the Be'er Tuvia–Kfar Warburg area, and the 54th entered a company into the Gedera–Bashit area. At the last minute, the General Staff cancelled the order because of an imminent ceasefire. The ceasefire did not take effect however, and the attack was postponed to the night of June 2–3. The Egyptians discovered the original plan, and were prepared to engage the Israeli forces.|$|E
5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.|$|E
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
5|$|Prinz Adalbert {{went into}} {{service as a}} gunnery {{training}} vessel for the fleet after her commissioning, while Friedrich Carl served with the cruiser division of the battle fleet. In 1909, Friedrich Carl joined her sister ship as a training vessel, {{being used as a}} torpedo training ship. The two ships were re-mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Both ships were assigned to Admiral Behring's cruiser squadron in the Baltic Sea, with Friedrich Carl serving as his flagship. The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. Behring was ordered to undertake actions against the Russian port of Libau, which was believed to be acting as a staging area for British submarines. On the first assault on the port, on 17 November 1914, Friedrich Carl struck a pair of Russian naval mines off Memel. The ship's crew managed to keep the cruiser afloat long enough to allow nearby vessels to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> entire crew; only seven men were killed in the attack. The operation proceeded as planned, however, and several blockships were sunk in the harbor entrance.|$|E

25|$|A fly is a {{covering}} over an opening join concealing the mechanism, {{such as a}} zipper, velcro or buttons, used to join the opening.

This route which runs from north-west to south-east of Kuala Lumpur is densely populated and is currently inadequately served by rail-based public transport.

25|$|On 28 August 1993 a non-scheduled {{domestic}} passenger flight operated by Tajik Air and {{served by a}} Yakovlev Yak-40 crashed during takeoff at Khorog Airport, killing 82 people on board (including 14 children). Militants {{during the civil war}} in Tajikistan forced the crew to take more passengers than the aircraft was able to carry, which led to an excess takeoff weight.

In retaliation, Vladimir attacked and pillaged Polotsk, killed Rogvolod, and took his daughter Rogneda by force, adding the city to his territorial possessions. He placed his son, Izyaslav, in Polotsk. Iziaslav's son, Bryachislav of Polotsk, succeeded his father in 1001.|$|E
25|$|The {{air traffic}} {{controller}} had instructed a Boeing 707 to take off and help guide the 757 back in to land, but before the 707 could <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> 757's left wingtip struck the water, approximately 25 minutes after the emergency declaration, revealing to the crew the true altitude of the airliner; the pilots struggled with the controls and managed to get airborne again for 17 seconds, but the aircraft crashed inverted into the water. All 70 passengers and crew died. The official accident report concluded that the flight crew, distracted by the conflicting warnings, did not heed the radar altimeter reading after descending through 2,500 feet.|$|E

After it was made clear that the Spanish authorities would not allow the plane to <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> hijackers surrendered at 14:47.
