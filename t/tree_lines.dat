5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the <b>tree</b> <b>lines,</b> or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
25|$|Several {{other reasons}} may cause the {{environment}} to be too extreme for trees to grow. This can include geothermal exposure associated with hot springs or volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone; high soil acidity near bogs; high salinity associated with playas or salt lakes; or ground that is saturated with groundwater that excludes oxygen from the soil, which most tree roots need for growth. The margins of muskegs and bogs are common examples {{of these types of}} open area. However, no such line exists for swamps, where trees, such as Bald cypress and the many mangrove species, have adapted to growing in permanently waterlogged soil. In some colder parts of the world there are <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> around swamps, where there are no local tree species that can develop. There are also man-made pollution <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> in weather-exposed areas, where new <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> have developed because of the increased stress of pollution. Examples are found around Nikel in Russia and previously in the Erzgebirge.|$|E
25|$|The alpine {{tree line}} at a {{location}} is dependent on local variables, such as aspect of slope, rain shadow and proximity to either geographical pole. In addition, in some tropical or island localities, the lack of biogeographical access to species that have evolved in a subalpine environment can result in lower <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> than one might expect by climate alone.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} on <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> dynamics has primarily {{been based on}} field inventory data, and {{little is known about}} the potential for using remotely sensed imagery to detect change. The present study developed a new methodology by combining remote sensing and field survey data to examine dynamics of the pristine forest in the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> area on Changbai Mountain in Northeast China over the past two decades. The new method normalized remote sensing data by using the adjacent old-growth coniferous forest (close to climax) below the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> as the reference (assuming steady state) to eliminate various potential errors associated with different satellite sensors, atmospheric conditions and seasonal vegetation changes. Specifically, we used a ratio of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) between the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest (birch) and the referenced old-growth coniferous forest, as well as a ratio between the interface forest against the referenced coniferous forest, to investigate growth dynamics of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest from 1977 to 1999. The interface forest is distributed between the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest and non-forest zone. Compared with traditional methods using remote sensing data, the new method has higher sensitivity to <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> dynamics. We found that the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> delineated from satellite imagery had shown no shift in the past decades. However, the NDVI ratio of <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest against the reference forest increased from 0. 9 to 1. 2 from 1977 to 1999, and the ratio of interface forest against the reference forest increased from 0. 83 to 0. 98, indicating that growth of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest apparently exceeded that of the reference coniferous forest and had grown denser. Field surveys also supported the conclusion from remote sensing results that the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest on Changbai Mountain has grown denser in the past decades. From 1980 to 2002, basal area of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest increased 35 % (from 18. 8 to 25. 3 m 2 ha- 1); at the same time the NDVI ratio increased about 33 %. This study suggests that it is possible to monitor growth of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest based on multi-temporal remote sensing images. We speculate that global warming may have contributed to the observed rapid growth of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest because temperature is a major limiting factor among climatic variables in the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> forest and effect from other factors, such as fire, harvesting and snow and wind damage, were not evident in this protected area in the past decades...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> is {{the edge}} of the habitat at which trees are capable of growing. It is found at high {{elevations}} and in frigid environments. Beyond the <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> <b>trees</b> cannot tolerate the environmental conditions (usually cold temperatures or lack of moisture). The <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> {{should not be confused with}} a lower [...] timberline or forest line, which is the <b>line</b> where <b>trees</b> form a forest with a closed canopy.|$|R
25|$|Lower {{elevations}} of the Rocky Mountains {{and all but}} {{the highest}} elevations of the Cypress Hills have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb). These areas have snowy but mild winters due to the warming effect of chinook winds, and cool summers due to their high elevation. As altitude increases and the subalpine zone is reached, this grades into a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), with much harsher winters and even cooler summers. Above the tree line, an alpine/polar climate (Köppen climate classification ET) prevails. Conditions this high are even colder and very windy. Precipitation is higher in these elevated regions than elsewhere in Alberta, and this supports forests of lodgepole pine and trembling aspen mixed with fescue grasslands in the montane areas, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir forests in the subalpine zone, and heather, sedges and mountain avens in the alpine zone above the <b>tree</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
500|$|Vann then {{ordered his}} pilot {{to make contact}} with the other L-19 that was leading the ten CH-21s with the first South Vietnamese reserve company from Tan Hiep. Vann relayed a message to the command pilot of the ten CH-21 helicopters, which were being escorted by a group of five {{recently}} deployed UH-1 Huey gunships, armed with 7.62mm machine guns and 2.75-inch rockets, and instructed him to land the reserve companies about [...] from the western and southern <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> that covered Ap Bac in order to minimize the effectiveness of the Viet Cong's [...]30 caliber machine guns. However, in the early phases of the Vietnam conflict, command relationships between US military units were not well-established, and American aircrews had a tendency to disregard the instructions of advisors, especially Vann, who was regarded as domineering. Instead of following Vann's instructions, the command pilot decided to lead his helicopters over southern Ap Tan Thoi and along the creek to Ap Bac. The US pilots landed their helicopters [...] west of Ap Bac, where they were hit multiple times by Viet Cong machine gun and small arms fire.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the alpine}} <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> shown above, polar <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> are heavily {{influenced}} by local variables such as aspect of slope and degree of shelter. In addition, permafrost has {{a major impact on}} the ability of trees to place roots into the ground. When roots are too shallow, trees are susceptible to windthrow and erosion. Trees can often grow in river valleys at latitudes where they could not grow on a more exposed site. Maritime influences such as ocean currents also {{play a major role in}} determining how far from the equator trees can grow as well as the warm summers experienced in extreme continental climates. In northern inland Scandinavia there is substantial maritime influence on high parallels that keep winters relatively mild, but enough inland effect to have summers well above the threshold for the tree line. Here are some typical polar treelines: ...|$|E

5000|$|Montane level: [...] Extends {{from the}} mid-altitude forests to the <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> The exact {{level of the}} <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> varies with local climate, but {{typically}} the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> is found where mean monthly soil temperatures never exceed 10.0 degrees C and the mean annual soil temperatures are around 6.7 degrees C. In the tropics, this region is typified by montane rain forest (above 3,000 ft) while at higher latitudes coniferous forests often dominate.|$|R
40|$|Understanding what {{environmental}} drivers {{control the}} position of the alpine <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> is important for refining our understanding of plant stress and tree development, as well as for climate change studies. However, monitoring the location of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> position and potential movement is difficult due to cost and technical challenges, as well as a lack of a clear boundary. Advanced remote sensing technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) offer significant potential to map short individual tree crowns within the transition zone despite the lack of predictive capacity. Process-based forest growth models offer a complementary approach by quantifying the environmental stresses trees experience at the <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> allowing transition zones to be defined and ultimately mapped. In this study, we investigate the role remote sensing and physiological, ecosystem-based modeling can play in the delineation of the alpine <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> To do so, we utilize airborne LiDAR data to map tree height and stand density across a series of altitudinal gradients from below to above the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> within the Swiss National Park (SNP), Switzerland. We then utilize a simple process-based model to assess the importance of seasonal variations on four climatically related variables that impose non-linear constraints on photosynthesis. Our results indicate that all methods predict the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> to within a 50  m altitudinal zone and indicate that aspect is not a driver of significant variations in <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> position in the region. Tree cover, rather than tree height is the main discriminator of the <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> at higher elevations. Temperatures in fall and spring are responsible for the major differences along altitudinal zones, however, changes in evaporative demand also control plant growth at lower altitudes. Our results indicate that the two methods provide complementary information on <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> location and, when combined, provide additional insights into potentially endangered forest/grassland transition zones...|$|R

2500|$|The German Army {{relied on}} the Luftwaffe to provide decisive {{assistance}} in silencing French guns, enabling the German infantry to inch forward. German progress was made only late {{on the third day}} of operations, finally forcing crossings; the French Air Force attempted to bomb them but failed. German sources acknowledged the battle was [...] "hard and costly in lives, the enemy putting up severe resistance, particularly in the woods and <b>tree</b> <b>lines</b> continuing the fight when our troops had pushed passed the point of resistance". South of Abbeville, the French Tenth Army under General Robert Altmayer had its front broken and it was forced to retreat to Rouen and south along the Seine river. The rapid German advances were the sign of a weakening enemy. Rommel and his 7th Panzer Division headed west over the Seine river through Normandy and captured the port of Cherbourg on 18 June. On the way to Cherbourg, Rommel forced the surrender of the British 51st (Highland) Division on 12 June. In close-quarter combat, the Luftwaffe was struggling to have an impact. However, in an operational sense, they helped disperse French armour. The German spearheads were overextended and vulnerable to counter strokes, but the concentration of the Luftwaffe denied the French the ability to concentrate, and the fear of air attack negated their mass and mobile use by Weygand.|$|E
