5|$|After {{the player}} {{successfully}} obtains {{the assistance of}} each of the primary factions, a Landsmeet is called among the nobles of Ferelden. There, the player confronts Loghain, ultimately either executing him or sparing and initiating him into the Grey Wardens (causing Alistair to resign). The player also settles who will lead Ferelden against the Blight (Alistair and/or Anora) and rallies the rest of the kingdom against the Darkspawn. At this point, the player learns that due to the <b>Taint,</b> only a Grey Warden can slay the Archdemon. Killing it will release a demonic essence within it, which is drawn to the <b>Taint</b> in the Grey Warden and effectively kills them; if anyone else slays it, the essence will survive and find a new host in the nearest Darkspawn, making the monster effectively immortal.|$|E

While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize {{the attacks on the}} Na'vi and <b>taint</b> his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary, and the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E

At this time Henry began paying court to Jane Seymour. He gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane, in the presence of Anne, began opening and shutting it. Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of food being <b>tainted</b> by packaging, ranging from {{compounds}} in the primary package migrating into the food, through <b>taints</b> arising from the inks or secondary packaging such as corrugated cartons, to pallets and containers. Much of our knowledge about the origin and nature of these <b>taints</b> was based on research performed in the 1970 s and 1980 s; since then there have been relatively few reports in the literature. However, {{this does not mean that}} <b>tainting</b> is no longer a problem. On the contrary, <b>taints</b> from, for example, organohalogens and photoinitiators are still occurring and few companies take the necessary precautions to avoid such <b>taints.</b> This paper will review recent cases of <b>tainting</b> of food from packaging with particular emphasis on organohalogens and photoinitiators and describe ways in which the food industry can avoid such <b>taints...</b>|$|R
5|$|At 17 {{he became}} the leader of Glebova's claque, {{was working as a}} copyist for lawyers, and going out to a theater, a tavern, or a party every night. He would later draw on his own life at this time for his {{portrayal}} of Protosov in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse. Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the <b>taint</b> of his mother's divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of their possessions and the theft of their money.|$|E
5|$|Duncan initiates {{the player}} into the Grey Wardens through a {{dangerous}} ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient is either killed or imbued with the powerful darkspawn essence, the <b>Taint,</b> granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a rudimentary connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be overwhelmed and slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.|$|E

When they visit the monastery Saint-Matthieu-des-Pyrénées-Orientales, Helen feels Dracula's presence and is compelled to jump off a cliff. Landing on grass, she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid herself of his threat and her fears.|$|E
40|$|Pointer <b>tainting</b> {{is a form}} of Dynamic Information Flow Tracking used {{primarily}} to prevent software security attacks such as buffer overflows. Researchers have also applied pointer <b>tainting</b> to malware and virus analysis. A recent paper by Slowinska and Bos has criticized pointer <b>tainting</b> as a security mechanism, arguing that it is has serious, inherent false positive and false negative defects. We present a rebuttal that addresses the confusion due to the two uses of pointer <b>tainting</b> in security literature. We clarify that many of the arguments against pointer <b>tainting</b> apply only to its use as a malware and virus analysis platform, but do not apply to the application of pointer <b>tainting</b> to memory corruption protection. Hence, we argue that pointer <b>tainting</b> remains a useful and promising technique for robust protection against memory corruption attacks...|$|R

5|$|The {{night before}} the final battle, the player meets Morrigan, who proposes a way to slay the Archdemon without sacrificing anyone: the two conceiving a child. The child, also {{carrying}} the <b>Taint,</b> would merge with the Archdemon once it dies, creating a demonic essence which will spare any Grey Warden. Morrigan agrees to conceive the child, which would resultantly be born a demigod, {{on the condition that}} she be allowed to raise it alone. The player can accept Morrigan's offer (if male), convince Alistair/Loghain to take part instead, or refuse the witch's proposal, which will cause her to leave the party.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the actions}} of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", {{abbreviated}} MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara {{as well as from the}} military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to <b>taint</b> the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.|$|E

25|$|Bitterness <b>taint</b> or amertume {{is rather}} {{uncommon}} and {{is produced by}} certain strains of bacteria from the genera Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, and Oenococcus. It begins by the degradation of glycerol, a compound naturally found in wine at levels of 5-8 g/L, via a dehydratase enzyme to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde. During ageing this is further dehydrated to acrolein which reacts with the anthocyanins and other phenols present within the wine to form the <b>taint.</b> As red wines contain high levels of anthocyanins they are generally more susceptible.|$|E

50|$|Though wentals are not hostile in nature, {{some aspects}} of their essence (under certain circumstances) can become 'tainted' due to strong selfish desires of their hosts.

Fortunately, <b>tainted</b> wentals cannot propagate, but are eternally enraged by everything around them. They seek to replace order with chaos (what they feel is the 'Natural order') and thus attack all those around them. <b>Tainted</b> wentals can either be destroyed by killing the host body, or extracting the <b>tainted</b> essence and purifying it (a process which also kills the host). Karla Tamblyn became a <b>Tainted</b> Wental after Jess recovered her frozen body from within the ice of Plumas where she had died many years before.
