5|$|Eventually {{a mysterious}} {{telephone}} call directed Harvard official Charles R. Apted to West Roxbury, {{where he was}} met by an automobile which he followed into some woods; there <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> with collars up and hatbrims down, handed him the Cod (not wrapped in any flag) before speeding away.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{attended}} Princeton College, {{where his}} classmates included William Elliott from western Ontario. Elliott's {{father was a}} Loyalist who had resettled in Canada after the Revolutionary War. The <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> were close enough that Elliot stayed with Hart's parents for a time to recover from a serious illness.|$|E
5|$|By 1500, the {{population}} had expanded considerably. There {{were at least}} five mound centers (although the Shoulderbone site's population had declined dramatically) and several hundred smaller towns and other settlements. Ocute enters the historical record in the chronicles of the expedition of Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto, which came through the chiefdom in 1539 {{on its way to}} Cofitachequi. They had learned about Ocute from <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> they had captured in Apalachee in present-day Florida.|$|E

60|$|The <b>two</b> <b>younger</b> <b>men</b> {{took their}} {{departure}} almost immediately. The others {{moved into the}} library. Mr. Foley plunged at once into the subject which was uppermost in their minds.|$|R
60|$|Butler {{told his}} father that the tailor had at least gone away from Baslehurst; and then the <b>two</b> <b>younger</b> <b>men</b> went out and walked about the grounds till dinner time.|$|R
5|$|Hu {{remained}} with Union {{and directed the}} company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> who compete {{for the love of}} a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences.|$|E
5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a no-go area, defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Sandy arrived, {{witnesses}} saw <b>two</b> <b>young</b> white <b>men</b> approaching his car. At that time, Sandy {{was confronted}} by <b>two</b> of the <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> who began looking through his vehicle. Shurov pulled Sandy from the car and began punching him. At about 9:45 p.m., at least four witnesses saw one white men assaulting a man.|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

60|$|The latter {{assumed a}} sudden dignity, necessitated {{by the sound}} of voices in the corridor, and departed.

Sir Henry shook hands with the latter and pointed to the easy-chair which his previous visitor had just vacated.|$|R
50|$|When <b>two</b> <b>young</b> black <b>men</b> {{began to}} swim, they were {{surrounded}} {{by a group of}} white boys, who splashed them and forced them {{to get out of the}} pool. About 50 white bystanders joined the group of white boys and began to surround and boo the <b>two</b> <b>young</b> black <b>men.</b> Although the police were called, officers did not address or punish the mob of whites. One hour later, another four <b>young</b> black <b>men</b> between 14 and 21 began to swim in the pool, and again, they were splashed and forced out by whites. The incidents were witnesses by 700-800 whites.|$|R

25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> {{playing a}} ball game.
