25|$|Imipramine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tofranil among others, is a <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> (TCA). It is mainly used in the {{treatment}} of major depression and enuresis (inability to control urination).|$|E
25|$|Favored {{treatments}} are certain antidepressants (<b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics {{are recognized as}} useful agents but are not recommended as first line treatments.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane Collaboration {{recently}} {{performed a}} systematic review of clinical {{trials of the}} <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> amitriptyline. The study concluded {{that in spite of}} moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{parameters and}} {{the time course of}} the effect after acute oral administration of yohimbine on salivary secretion in patients treated with <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> were investigated. Yohimbine (10 mg) increased both salivary outflow and plasma noradrenaline levels for 4 h. Pharmacokinetic parameters (t 1 / 2, tmax, Cmax and AUCexp) and plasma concentrations of noradrenaline were higher in patients treated with <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> than in controls. At this dose, yohimbine induced a relatively large number of side effects. A lower dose (4 mg) increased salivary secretion for 3 h without any side effects in patients treated with <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> but not in healthy volunteers. These data describe an interaction between yohimbine and <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> and thus show that a relatively low dose (4 mg) of yohimbine could be useful in the treatment of dry mouth due to <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants...</b>|$|R

25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{may occur}} during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between {{the return of}} the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important. Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when clomipramine is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive cholinergic activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by tricyclic antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the late}} 1950s, the first modern {{antipsychotic}} and antidepressant drugs were developed: chlorpromazine (also known as Thorazine), the first widely used antipsychotic, was synthesized in 1950, and iproniazid, {{one of the first}} antidepressants, was first synthesized in 1957. In 1959 imipramine, the first <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant,</b> was developed.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Anafranil among others, is a <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> (TCA). It {{is used for the}} {{treatment}} of obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain. It may decrease the risk of suicide in those over the age of 65. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{would seem}} to suggest similar efficacy for SSRIs and <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> in initial treatment for dAD. If these treatments do not address the symptoms, it would be reasonable to try noradrenergic drugs, secondary amine <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants,</b> or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants,</b> anticonvulsants, and {{capsaicin}} {{reduce the}} pain of diabetic neuropathy; limited data suggests that lidocaine patches may also be efficacious. Both <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> and anticonvulsants are superior to placebo in relieving painful diabetic neuropathy. Compared with placebo, patients taking <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> report reduced pain (number needed to treat [NNT] for at least 50 % reduction= 3. 5) (strength of recommendation [SOR]: A). Similarly, patients taking anticonvulsants report reduced pain (NNT for at least 50 % reduction in pain= 2. 7) (SOR: A) ...|$|R

25|$|Doxepin is a <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> (TCA) {{used as a}} pill {{to treat}} major {{depressive}} disorder, anxiety disorders, chronic hives, and for short-term help with trouble remaining asleep after going to bed (a form of insomnia). As a cream it is used for short term treatment of itchiness to due atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus.|$|E
25|$|Tricyclic antidepressants: <b>Tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> {{prescription}} drugs with anti-muscarinic properties {{have been proven}} successful in treating bedwetting, but also have {{an increased risk of}} side effects, including death from overdose. These drugs include amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline. Studies find that patients using these drugs are 4.2 times as likely to stay dry as those taking a placebo. The relapse rates after stopping the medicines are close to 50%.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} the primary treatment for bulimia. Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> class may have a modest benefit. While outcomes with bulimia are typically better than in those of anorexia, {{the risk of death}} among those affected is higher than that of the general population. At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered.|$|E

As a comparison, {{the interaction of}} these drugs with the corresponding enzyme from kidney cortex was also investigated. In addition to chlorpromazine, the benzomorphans and the <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> inhibited the brain enzyme considerably, whereas the MAO inhibitors had little effect. The (Na+ + K+) -ATPase from kidney was not affected by the benzomorphans or MAO inhibitors, but its activity diminished {{in the presence of}} the <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressants</b> and chlorpromazine...|$|R
25|$|Tianeptine, {{sold under}} the brand names Stablon and Coaxil among others, is an {{atypical}} antidepressant {{which is used}} mainly {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder, although it may also be used to treat anxiety, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. In terms of chemical structure, it is technically a <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> (TCA), but it has a very different drug profile than other TCAs, and is not usually grouped with them.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in amygdalar CB1 receptor binding following imipramine treatment {{is consistent with}} prior studies which collectively demonstrate that several treatments which are beneficial to depression, such as electroconvulsive shock and <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> treatment, increase CB1 receptor activity in subcortical limbic structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. And preclinical studies have demonstrated the CB1 receptor {{is required for the}} behavioral effects of noradrenergic based antidepressants but is dispensable for the behavioral effect of serotonergic based antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Elavil among others, is a {{medicine}} used to treat a number of mental illnesses. These include major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, and less commonly {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and bipolar disorder. Other uses include prevention of migraines, treatment of neuropathic pain such as fibromyalgia and postherpetic neuralgia, and less commonly insomnia. It is in the <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> (TCA) class and its exact mechanism of action is unclear. Amitriptyline is taken by mouth.|$|E

25|$|Antidepressant {{discontinuation}} {{symptoms were}} first reported with imipramine, the first <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> (TCA), {{in the late}} 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs. As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes. The problem has been poorly studied, {{and most of the}} literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.|$|E
25|$|HCO3 is {{used for}} {{treatment}} of hyperkalemia, as it will drive K+ back into cells during periods of acidosis. Since sodium bicarbonate can cause alkalosis, it is sometimes used to treat aspirin overdoses. Aspirin requires an acidic environment for proper absorption, and the basic environment diminishes aspirin absorption {{in the case of}} an overdose. Sodium bicarbonate has also been used in the treatment of <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> overdose. It can also be applied topically as a paste, with three parts baking soda to one part water, to relieve some kinds of insect bites and stings (as well as accompanying swelling).|$|E
25|$|Funded by SmithKline Beecham, {{the acute}} phase of study 329 was an eight-week, double-blind, {{randomized}} clinical trial conducted in 12 university or hospital psychiatric {{departments in the}} United States and Canada between 1994 and 1997. The study compared paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor marketed as Paxil and Seroxat, with imipramine, a <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> marketed as Tofranil, in teenagers aged 12–18 with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder of at least eight weeks duration. Martin Keller, then {{professor of psychiatry at}} Brown University, had proposed the trial to the company in 1992 as the largest study until then to examine the efficacy of SSRIs in children.|$|E

25|$|The inquest on 27 October 1980 {{showed that}} in 24 hours, Bonham had {{consumed}} around 40 shots (1–1.4 litres) of 40% ABV vodka, after which he vomited and choked. The finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body, {{in keeping with his}} recent abstention from heroin, which he had used intermittently for several years; although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.|$|E
25|$|Study 329 was a {{clinical}} trial conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of paroxetine, an SSRI anti-depressant, in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Led by Martin Keller, then {{professor of psychiatry at}} Brown University, and funded by the British pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham—known since 2000 as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)—the study compared paroxetine with imipramine, a <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant,</b> and placebo (an inert pill). SmithKline Beecham had released paroxetine in 1991, marketing it as Paxil in North America and Seroxat in the UK. The drug attracted sales of $11.7billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12billion in 2002, the year before it lost its patent.|$|E
25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that haloperidol {{may be more effective}} than the <b>tricyclic</b> <b>antidepressant</b> clomipramine, and that the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, memantine has been shown to significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of memantine in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
