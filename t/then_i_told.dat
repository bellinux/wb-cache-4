When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “A baiji named Saraswatibai, {{renowned for}} her singing, {{had come from}} Kashi. We wanted {{to listen to her}} singing. She charged six hundred rupees for a single night’s performance. We sent Shyamsundar, “Go and bargain, see what you can manage.” Shyamsundar went and could fix her up for three hundred rupees. He came back and said, “Three hundred rupees and two bottles of brandy.” On hearing about the brandy we were taken aback, mummy could object. Shyamsundar said, “She cannot sing without taking brandy.” Everything was ready. Saraswati entered the gathering. She was demure, round nosed, nothing great. Natore said, “Abanda, what have you done? Just thrown away three hundred rupees.” She was going to sing two songs. Natore was ready to {{accompany}} her on the mridangam. As the clock struck ten she started singing. One song and it was eleven at night. Natore was paralysed with the mridnagam in his lap. The wonderful voice of Saraswati reverberated around that dance-hall. How wonderfully she had tuned her voice. Some of us with pillows in our laps, others with hands close to our hearts, we were all wonderstruck. The gathering was won over with just one song. Everyone was still immersed in the song, when Saraswati said, “Aur kuch farmaiye.” (present your wish). After listening to her, no one dared to put anything forward. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Shyamsundar, “Ask her to sing a bhajan. We have heard that bhajans of Kashi are very famous.” She sang a bhajan known to all, “Ao to Brajachandalal...” (Come oh, Lord!) Everybody was dumbfounded...|$|E

60|$|Alon. <b>Then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you, run {{quickly to}} the corrigidor, and desire him to come hither in person to examine a malefactor. [WILDBLOOD sneezes within.] Hark! what noise is that within? I think one sneezes.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> {{went and}} <b>told</b> Marie what <b>I</b> had promised. Somewhat to my {{surprise}} {{she said that she}} thought I had acted wisely.|$|R
2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> our names, and in {{an instant}} the front door opened.|$|E

60|$|We all {{shook hands}} and sat down. <b>Then</b> Phil and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> our stories {{straight}} to the finish, and I also produced the letters I had taken from the locker in Captain Hannock's stateroom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} waited," [...] she confessed, [...] "until you cared {{for me a}} great deal, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> should have <b>told</b> you. That, <b>I</b> admit, was my intention." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{him that}} Alexis {{would not come}} for some time yet, and he grew calmer.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{him when}} the sailor had had speech with me, and again {{repeated}} the message.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> hurriedly <b>told</b> of my father's arrival, and {{explained}} more fully than I had yet ventured {{to do his}} misconceptions and prejudices as to Eve.

5000|$|Hours {{before the}} shooting, Bello {{sent an e-mail}} to the New York Daily News, making various accusations in regards to his firing, stating [...] "First, <b>I</b> was <b>told</b> it was because I always kept to myself.

[...] Bello blamed a specific doctor for blocking his career progress and costing him $400,000.|$|R
60|$|There was a deal of {{handshaking}} {{and congratulations}} before we {{settled down to}} anything like rational talk, and <b>then</b> Jerry and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> how we found the captain, and what had happened since Darius left the smoke-house.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{my story}} in full just as I have written it here. Mr. Harrison was deeply interested.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Hans {{as much as}} I thought {{advisable}} of {{how this}} horrid little talisman came into my possession.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him {{all we had}} {{accomplished}} that morning, and explained what Darius proposed we should do, whereupon he cried heartily: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite right. That wasn't {{how it was}} done. Listen." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him of the coco sample which Poirot {{had taken}} to be analysed.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him <b>I</b> feared {{there was}} some mistake, as no {{buttonhole}} bouquets had been ordered, but he insisted on his former declaration, and so I brought them away {{and sent them to}} their respective destinations.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him {{the whole}} story of my {{connection}} with the island, and of the unfortunate results of the contact between these poor people and our superior modern civilization.|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them everything, both of Hendrika's {{threats and}} of her fierce attempt to carry them into execution. But I did not tell my horrid dream.|$|E
60|$|However, the Indian added, plying {{the paddle}} all the while, {{that if we}} would go along he must go with us, he our man, and he suppose that if he no takum pay for what he do Sunday then ther's no harm, but if he takum pay <b>then</b> wrong. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{him that he was}} stricter than white men. Nevertheless, I noticed that he did not forget to reckon in the Sundays at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'd {{been all}} right if Gulden had only cashed. But he hadn't. He came to an' bellered fer his gun an' fer his pards.

6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him {{the whole}} thing, {{and he said}} it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He did," [...] said Torrance grimly. [...] "Still, for 'most {{two years}} I kept a curb on my temper. <b>Then</b> one evening <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{him he had}} to choose right then between his fancies and me. I could have no {{dealings}} with any man who talked as he did." ...|$|R
