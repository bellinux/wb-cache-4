5|$|Casino Royale is {{the first}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming.

5|$|After a short gain {{on first}} down, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to fullback Brian Edmonds. The play {{resulted in a}} first down at the Tech 34-yard line. <b>Two</b> <b>short</b> plays resulted in six yards, setting up a third down and four yards. Rather than attempt a conversion prior {{to the end of}} the quarter, the Hokies let the clock roll down with the Longhorns in the lead, 70.|$|E

50|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a biceps, which is a point in a meter which can equally be <b>two</b> <b>shorts</b> or a long, as is found in the dactylic hexameter. The biceps is freely able to be <b>two</b> <b>shorts</b> or a long, while resolution, particularly in tragedy, can only occur within very restricted situations. Two resolved longa in the same line is very unusual, for instance, while a biceps that is <b>two</b> <b>shorts</b> can freely be followed by another biceps that is <b>two</b> <b>shorts.</b> Also, <b>two</b> <b>shorts</b> that resolve into a long are almost always within the same word-unit.|$|R
50|$|It {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with resolution, which is the replacement of a long with <b>two</b> <b>shorts.</b> Resolution is carefully limited within a line, whereas a biceps can freely be either long or <b>two</b> <b>shorts.</b>|$|R

In an obtuse triangle the <b>two</b> <b>shortest</b> sides' perpendicular bisectors (extended beyond their opposite triangle {{sides to the}} circumcenter) are divided by their respective intersecting triangle sides in equal proportions.|$|R
5|$|Blakeley {{spent most}} of the rest of the war on convoy escort duty in the Caribbean Sea Frontier, except for <b>two</b> <b>short</b> {{deployments}} in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 January to 23 February 1943 she was assigned to hunter-killer duty with Task Group 21.13 in the North Atlantic, and from 24 March to 11 May 1943, she escorted a convoy to Bizerte, Tunisia. From 18 March to 13 June 1945, she was stationed in New London, Connecticut, training U.S. submarines in Long Island Sound to avoid destroyers.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other species}} in genus Scytalopus, the Perijá tapaculo is secretive and {{therefore}} difficult to observe. The call and song {{differ from those}} of most other species in the genus, and the latter is composed of <b>two</b> <b>short</b> churrs repeating up to 65 times at 0.5 to 3second intervals. The diet of the species is little known, but studies of the stomach contents of seven specimens suggested that they fed exclusively on insects.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{returned}} on offense, {{needing to}} score quickly, make {{a stop on}} defense, then score a second {{time to take the}} lead. The energized Tech defense was disinclined to allow any such thing. Though Cantwell completed <b>two</b> <b>short</b> passes for 16yards and a first down, he was sacked on first down and the Tech defense prevented him from completing another pass. Two passes were knocked down by Hokie defenders, while another fell short. After Louisville failed to convert a fourth down, Virginia Tech took over on offense. The Hokies proceeded to run out the clock, executing <b>two</b> <b>short</b> rushes and an incomplete pass. Louisville had one final chance on offense after a Tech punt, but three consecutive desperation Hail Mary passes were unsuccessful. Two fell incomplete, and the third was intercepted by Tech cornerback Brandon Flowers. With time almost gone, Tech finished running out the clock and secured the victory. As time expired, Virginia Tech held a 35–24 lead and won the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|M-90 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan. It runs from near North Branch eastward to Lexington situated on Lake Huron. The highway is a lightly traveled roadway that runs through rural farmlands.

Along the routing, there are two river crossings and one railroad crossing.|$|E
5|$|No. 20 Squadron {{was formed}} at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 1 August 1941 {{for a general}} {{reconnaissance}} role, {{under the command of}} Squadron Leader W.N. Gibson. Its establishment was six PBY Catalina flying boats and 133 personnel, but only five aircraft (all transferred from No. 11 Squadron) and 55 personnel were available initially. The squadron conducted long-range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron. On 18 November, No. 20 Squadron's Catalinas were augmented by <b>two</b> <b>Short</b> Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|The Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was {{incorporated}} on 31 July 1845 and, having acquired the Blaenavon Tramroad {{in the same}} year, it rebuilt and extended the line, which re-opened from Pontypool to Blaenavon (North) on 2 October 1854. <b>Two</b> <b>short</b> and steep branches to Cwmfrwdoer and Cwmnantddu were opened in 1870, with a third to Abersychan and Talywain in 1879. A 99-year lease of the line was granted to the Great Western Railway from 1 August 1875 and the railway company acquired the line on 1 August 1880.|$|E

5|$|The Thalassocalycida, only {{discovered}} in 1978 and known from only one species, are medusa-like, with bodies that are shortened in the oral-aboral direction, and short comb-rows {{on the surface}} furthest from the mouth, originating from near the aboral pole.

30|$|Also {{the visual}} dFT {{amplitude}} maps that the CrysTBox program outputs {{are useful for}} assessing {{whether or not the}} numerical outputs of the lattice vector magnitudes refer to the <b>two</b> <b>shortest</b> reciprocal lattice vectors. These kinds of assessments are necessary because the CrysTBox program follows the strategy to assign the reciprocal lattice basis vectors to FCs with large amplitudes, which are not necessarily also the <b>two</b> <b>shortest</b> reciprocal lattice vectors. When the numerical outputs of this program do not include information on the <b>two</b> <b>shortest</b> reciprocal lattice vectors that are visible in the dFT, one needs to obtain qualitatively correct lattice parameters by re-calculating them from the provided numerical outputs of the CrysTBox program.|$|R
