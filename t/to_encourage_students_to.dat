The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, the Internet {{facilitates}} language revitalization. Throughout the years, {{the digital}} environment has developed in various sophisticated ways {{that allow for}} virtual contact.

Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization {{in the sense that}} speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken {{can take advantage of the}} Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as Skype, language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.|$|E
