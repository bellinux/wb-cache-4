5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> {{as an attempt to}} display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers did not start to give their daughters in marriage to Ottoman princes until the fifteenth century, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> to have grown in importance. This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men were free to marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, Smith met Rosemary Corcoran, a 25-year-old {{mother of}} three from Castle Vale at the same public house, and again <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> leaving together. He drove her to Worcestershire before bludgeoning her to death and running over her body near Droitwich Spa. She was found at 8:30am on 12 November by a man walking his dog in a lane near Junction 5 of the M5 motorway.|$|E

5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 it was {{reported}} that Usher briefly dated British supermodel Naomi Campbell for a few months, together the pair attended the MTV Europe Music Awards and it {{was reported}} that Naomi jumped out of a pop out cake to surprise him for his birthday.

5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable {{at the time}} because it was unusual for the cardinals to elect friars, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> by some as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often respected by the cardinals, but rarely elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E

5|$|After {{the cinema}} closed, it was {{purchased}} by Develop UK, and several {{attempts were made to}} turn the building into a Wetherspoons pub. However these were rejected by the council twice, once in the initial planning application, and also in a subsequent appeal. The application was denied due to the moratorium on new food and drink licences in Withington, part of the town's unitary development plan. In 2002 the building {{was purchased by}} Arrows International. They applied for planning permission in December 2002 to demolish part of the cinema, reconstructing it as five ground floor shops, with 21flats on the upper floors. These plans were withdrawn as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as overdeveloping the site.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Australia by {{the mid-19th century}} by Scottish migrants such as Chieftain Areneas Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, Scotland. Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their Highland cattle to a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black Highland cattle on Churchill Island. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> and survived in Port Victoria during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out {{in areas such as}} New South Wales. In 1988 the Australian Highland Cattle Society was formed. Since then, numbers have been growing and semen is being exported to New Zealand to establish the breed there.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
5|$|It targets {{the poorest}} of the poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

5|$|Mary Shelley {{was born}} as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town, London, in 1797. She {{was the second}} child of the feminist philosopher, educator, and writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and {{journalist}} William Godwin. Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute. However, because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her illegitimate child, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as shocking. Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 2000, Smith met 21-year-old Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict from Alum Rock, Birmingham, at the Rainbow public house, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> leaving together. He {{took her to}} a hospital appointment and later killed her. Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook, where he set it alight. The still-smouldering remains were discovered at 6:15am next morning (9 November) by two patrolling police officers. The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints. A subsequent post mortem concluded that she had been strangled before being rolled up in a carpet and set on fire.|$|E
5|$|Several {{favorite}} son candidates had delegates {{interested in their}} nomination, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination. Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He {{was seen as a}} pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. Henly James {{was the head of the}} Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored Edward P. Allis, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money, but had no experience in elected office. Finally, Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, Chase's Inquirer, and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among the most radical of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.|$|E
