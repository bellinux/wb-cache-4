The consulate was closed for International Workers' Day (celebrated on May 1), but they said they were re-opening their offices on Monday, May 4. The warning concluded by suggesting U.S. citizens traveling or living in Mexico to consult the alerts and warnings page at the website of the U.S. Department of State.
