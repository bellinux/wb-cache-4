5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} no signs of enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the group. By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.|$|E

However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.|$|E

5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea, {{commonly}} known as the blushing morel, is a species of ascomycete fungus in the family Morchellaceae. A choice edible species, the fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists Gastón Guzmán and Fidel Tapia from collections made in Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more widespread after several DNA studies suggested that it is common in the West Coast of the United States, Israel, Australia, and Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted {{a bright}} star (HIP106829) with a visible {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, it would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E

5|$|During {{the entire}} {{course of his}} {{campaign}} in Dalmatia and Croatia, Tvrtko was also engaged in skirmishes in the east of his realm, which prevented him from focusing all of his manpower on expansion westwards. The Kingdom of Bosnia was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from {{the reach of the}} Ottomans during Tvrtko I's reign, shielded by a belt of independent Serbian statelets. George II of Zeta, however, purposely enabled the Turks to launch raids against Bosnia, first in 1386 (of which little is known) and again in 1388. In the second instance the Ottoman and Zetan invaders, led by Lala Şahin Pasha, penetrated as far as Bileća. The Battle of Bileća, which took place in late August 1388, ended with the victory of the Bosnian army, led by Duke Vlatko Vuković.|$|E
5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E
5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E

5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's Firebrand strike fighter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's trailing edge, looking over {{a very long}} and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The Firecrest had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} gas turbine engines, and while Blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the Firecrest, (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E

Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a short life as a business venture, as it was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> too expensive.

5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive.

Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E

5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{breeding}} {{populations are}} in Russia (up to 500,000pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines {{in much of}} the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from footpaths or human habitation.|$|E

Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} could spend time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris' life.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect is so large that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest ionization energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic number, has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E
