Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the {{building}} with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then compacts him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E
25|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{nature of}} the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions {{from each of the}} individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats.

25|$|Polistes instabilis {{seem to have}} a mutualistic {{relationship}} with Croton suberosus, a neotropical shrub. The shrub produces nectar as a reward to pollinators. In return for pollinating, workers get to feed on the nectar. In addition, workers defend the shrub against herbivores such as caterpillars <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> feed on it. The workers also prey on the caterpillars, adding an extra benefit for defending the plant.|$|E

25|$|Even if the Jamtish {{official}} status is a dialect many Jamtish {{people see it}} as an own language.

The claimers say to look at the different words and pronunciations of them. Whether or not it is its own language has been widely debated since the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The immune {{responses}} of antibodies, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{fight off the}} foreign virus, actually increase transmission and make the infection worse. Scientists found levels of protein D7 to be more prevalent in salivary glands of dengue-infected mosquitoes compared to those uninfected. D7 is found in mosquito saliva and was thought to assist the process of blood feeding. Despite the prior assumptions, D7 can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent virus infection. Unfortunately D7 proteins provoke immune responses, which raise anti-D7 antibody levels. These antibodies inhibit the function of D7 proteins, which enhance transmission of dengue virus.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the prophetic works, the {{character}} Oothoon represented America in Visions of the Daughters of Albion and she is raped by the character Bromion. The book represents her as trapped by a philosophical system created by John Locke, {{and no one is}} able to hear her pleas except for the daughters of Albion. The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he witnesses Orc and the rebelling colonies. Although there is a vision of rebellion, there is no actual freedom {{at the end of the}} poem just as in the Visions of the Daughters of Albion. Unlike the Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, as well as Europe, describes nations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> determine their own destiny instead of individuals trying to deal with theirs. The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E

500|$|The U.S. {{frequently}} {{uses its}} economic power {{in order to}} punish other countries. [...] One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. [...] Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they {{can be broken down}} into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. [...] The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. [...] An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. [...] More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. [...] An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> compete with the U.S. economically. [...] The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.|$|E
500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks to groove to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, the kind who love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website {{was impressed with the}} diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we {{are going to go}} through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

2500|$|Currents {{has also}} been {{frequently}} characterised as a breakup album. Prior to recording, Parker {{made the decision to}} break up with French singer-songwriter Melody Prochet.

Parker downplayed the notion that the album was entirely aimed at former lovers, however, and likened it to an inner monologue: [...] "It's really me talking to myself, another part of myself... to my old self, the part of me that resists change and wants me to stay as I am."

He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books out there <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> develop franchise characters."

2500|$|In 2015 Elliott, {{along with}} two [...] collaborators, Don Sebesky and Christofer Austin, won a Tony Award for his {{orchestration}} in the Broadway musical, An American in Paris. The production attracted attention because its direction and choreography were done by a ballet choreographer with no previous experience directing musicals. The production had already been performed in Paris for four months when Elliott was hired to adapt the music to better suit Broadway. [...] "I {{was brought in to}} re-do some of the songs in a more theatrical way," [...] Elliott said. In this process, the directors carefully study the audience responses during preview shows, then fine-tune the show based on what the director feels the audience responds to.

The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories decided to allow movement in and out of the territories for humanitarian and medical reasons, as well as to allow worshippers to enter Al-Aqsa mosque for Friday prayers except for residents of the Gaza Strip. Lieberman also ordered to halt the practice of returning bodies of other perpetrators of other recent attacks. Erdan proposed to re-establish a cemetery used by Israel during the Second Intifada to bury Palestinian assailants instead of transferring their bodies to their families, an offer Lieberman reportedly supported. Lieberman also demanded to demolish the houses of the perpetrators in 24 hours but Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said [...] "Israel was governed by the rule of law and that due process took longer than that." [...] The US State department urged Israel to ensure that [...] "any measures it takes are designed to also take into consideration the impact on Palestinian citizens <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> go about their daily lives."
