40|$|The OECD is {{developing}} a strategic response to the crisis focusing on two priority areas: finance, competition and governance; and restoring long-term growth. As part of this strategic response, the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry (DSTI) has analysed the likely impact of the downturn on the drivers of long term economic growth and the innovation-related items in policy responses of major countries. Special workshops and sessions on the economic crisis were held by the Committee for Innovation, Industry and Entrepreneurship, the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy, and the Committee for Information, Computer and Communications Policy. In January 2009, the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry circulated a questionnaire to member countries to collect information on specific innovation-related items of their stimulus packages. By May 2009, 27 member countries, all five OECD accession countries (Chile, Estonia, Israel, Russia and Slovenia) and South Africa had answered the questionnaire. In May 2009, the three OECD Committees recommended to make public, under their responsibility, this updated version. This report {{presents the results of}} <b>this</b> exercise: the <b>first</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>reports</b> the general analysis {{of the impact of the}} crisis and the appropriate policy responses, and the second chapter reviews current national responses. ...|$|R
40|$|In Abramovich 04, it was {{demonstrated}} that the likelihood ratio (LR) for multivariate complex Gaussian distribution has the invariance property that can be exploited in many applications. Specifically, the probability density function (p. d. f.) of this LR for the (unknown) actual covariance matrix _ 0 {{does not depend on}} this matrix and is fully specified by the matrix dimension M and the number of independent training samples T. Since this p. d. f. could therefore be pre-calculated for any a priori known (M,T), one gets a possibility to compare the LR of any derived covariance matrix estimate against this p. d. f., and eventually get an estimate that is statistically "as likely" as the a priori unknown actual covariance matrix. This "expected likelihood" (EL) quality assessment allows for significant improvement of MUSIC DOA estimation performance in the so-called "threshold area" Abramovich 04,Abramovich 07 d, and for diagonal loading and TVAR model order selection in adaptive detectors Abramovich 07,Abramovich 07 b. Recently, a broad class of the so-called complex elliptically symmetric (CES) distributions has been introduced for description of highly in-homogeneous clutter returns. The aim of this report is to extend the EL approach to this class of CES distributions as well as to a particularly important derivative of CES, namely the complex angular central distribution (ACG). For both cases, we demonstrate a similar invariance property for the LR associated with the true scatter matrix _ 0. More precisely, we show that the probability density function (p. d. f.) of the likelihood ratio (LR) for the (unknown) actual scatter matrix _ 0 does not depend on the latter: it only depends on the density generator for the CES distribution and is distribution-free in the case of ACG distributed data, i. e., it only depends on the matrix dimension M and the number of independent training samples T. Furthermore, we derive fixed point regularized covariance matrix estimates using the generalized expected likelihood methodology. <b>This</b> <b>first</b> <b>chapter</b> of <b>this</b> <b>report</b> is devoted to the conventional scenario (T ≥ M) while Chapter 2 deals with the under-sampled scenario (T ≤ M). Although the two parts are closely related, each one is self-contained and could be read independently...|$|R
