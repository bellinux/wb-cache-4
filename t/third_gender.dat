25|$|Among the {{religions}} that originated in India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear than among the Abrahamic traditions, and religious authorities voice diverse opinions. In 2005, an authority figure of Sikhism condemned same-sex {{marriage and the}} practice of homosexuality. However, many people in Sikhism do not oppose gay marriage. Hinduism is diverse, with no supreme governing body, but the majority of swamis opposed same-sex relationships in a 2004 survey, and a minority supported them. Ancient religious texts such as the Vedas often refer to people of a <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> known as hijra, who are neither female nor male. Some see this <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> as an ancient parallel to modern western lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex identities.|$|E
25|$|The hijras are officially {{recognized}} as <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> by some governments, being considered neither completely male nor female. Hijras have a recorded {{history in the}} Indian subcontinent from antiquity onwards {{as suggested by the}} Kama Sutra period. This history features a number of well-known roles within subcontinental cultures, part gender-liminal, part spiritual and part survival.|$|E
25|$|Among {{historical}} figures, {{some were}} recorded as having relations with others {{of their own}} sex — exclusively or together with opposite-sex relations — while others were recorded as only having relations with the opposite sex. However, there are instances of same-sex love and sexuality within almost all ancient civilizations. Additionally, Transsexual and Transgender and <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> people have been recorded in almost all cultures across human history.|$|E

25|$|In some {{cultures}} of Asia, a hijra is usually {{considered to be}} neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically male or intersex, but some are anatomically female. The hijra form a <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras {{can be compared to}} transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.|$|E
25|$|The khanith form an {{accepted}} <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> in Oman. The khanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, {{and they often}} do at weddings or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, khaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.|$|E

5000|$|The manhood tests {{became more}} and more torturous with time during which men were {{expected}} not to show the slightest sign of pain or sigh. Boys who failed these tests were denied membership of men's spaces, which amounted to denying manhood and being emasculated, and were isolated as one of the <b>third</b> <b>genders,</b> deprived of social rights and privileges available to 'men.' [...] This was a fate worse than death for masculine gendered males.|$|R
25|$|Transgender people {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression and their assigned sex. Transgender {{is also an}} umbrella term because, in addition to including trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition), it may include genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a <b>third</b> <b>gender,</b> and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
25|$|Nepal {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in Asia to abolish the death penalty. Nepal is the only Asian country where the possibility of same-sex marriage has been proposed in the high court and in the legislature although same-sex marriage currently does not exist in Nepal (see also LGBT rights in Nepal and Same-sex marriage in Nepal). The decision was based on a seven-person government committee study, and enacted through Supreme Court's ruling November 2008. The ruling granted full rights for LGBT individuals, including the right to marry and now can get citizenship as a <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> rather than male or female as authorised by Nepal's Supreme Court in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Since the 18th century, {{the civic}} {{dimension}} of gender identity has been eclipsed by the sexual dimension of gender identity, and, today, effeminacy {{has often been}} considered a vice, indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a pejorative insinuation of homosexual tendencies in boys or men. In other societies, by contrast, effeminate boys or men may be considered a distinct human gender (<b>third</b> <b>gender),</b> and may have a special social function, {{as is the case}} of Two-Spirits in some Native American groups. Furthermore, some see effeminacy to be a characteristic or trait, part of a particular person's gender role and in this sense would not be considered a vice or indicative of any other characteristics. An effeminate boy or man is similar to a fop or a dandy, though these tend to be archaic identities that are taken on by the individual rather than insulting labels.|$|E

25|$|Hindus {{have many}} sacred texts and {{different}} communities give special importance to different texts. Even {{more so than}} in other religions, Hindus also foster disparate interpretations of the meaning of various texts. The Vedas, which form the foundation of Hinduism for many, do not refer explicitly to homosexuality, but Rigveda says regarding Samsara that Vikruti Evam Prakriti (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes the cyclical constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. People of a <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> (tritiya-prakriti), not fully men nor women, are mentioned here and there throughout Hindu texts such as the Puranas but are not specifically defined. In general they are portrayed as effeminate men, often cowardly, and with no desire for women. Modern readers often draw parallels between these and modern stereotypes of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexual identities.|$|E
500|$|The gender {{identity}} [...] "transgender" [...] has been recategorized to trans* by some groups, where trans (without the asterisk) {{has been used}} to describe trans men and trans women, while trans* covers all non-cisgender (genderqueer) identities, including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderfuck, genderless, agender, non-gendered, <b>third</b> <b>gender,</b> two-spirit, bigender, and trans man and trans woman. Likewise, the term transsexual commonly falls under the umbrella term transgender, but some transsexual people object to this.|$|E
500|$|LGBT {{themes in}} Hindu mythology involve Hindu deities or heroes whose {{attributes}} or {{behavior can be}} interpreted as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT), or as having elements of gender variance and non-heterosexual sexuality. Traditional Hindu literary sources do not speak of homosexuality directly, but changes of sex, homoerotic encounters, and intersex or <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> characters are often found both in traditional religious narratives such as the Vedas, [...] Mahabharata, Ramayana and Puranas as well as in regional folklore.|$|E

50|$|In Hinduism, Shiva {{is still}} worshipped as an Ardhnarishwara, i.e. half-male and half-female form. Shiva's symbol, which is today known as Shivalinga, {{actually}} comprises {{a combination of}} a 'Yoni' (vagina) and a 'Ling' (phallus).The <b>third</b> <b>genders</b> have been ascribed spiritual powers by most indigenous societies. In the Indian subcontinent, e.g., the Hijras are supposed to have supernatural powers, through which they can bless people or curse them. This gives Hijras a unique space in the society, and traditional Indians still invite Hijras to seek their blessings on important occasions such as marriage.|$|R
5000|$|Intersex scholar Morgan Holmes {{states that}} much early anthropological {{material}} on non-European cultures described gender systems {{with more than}} two categories as [...] "primitive", but also that subsequent analysis of <b>third</b> sexes and <b>genders</b> is simplistic or romanticized: much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a 'third sex' portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two. I argue that to understand whether a system {{is more or less}} oppressive than another we have to understand how it treats its various members, not only its 'thirds'... recognition of third sexes and <b>third</b> <b>genders</b> is not equal to valuing the presence of those who were neither male nor female, and often hinges on the explicit devaluation of women ...|$|R
500|$|Indigenous {{people in}} North and South America {{conceptualized}} a <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> for men-women and women-men. These roles were recorded of the Coahuiltecan Indians in Texas, Timucuan in Florida, and Cueva in Panama. In Cree, {{the term for}} a man who took the role of a woman was ayekkwew; the Zuni word for a woman who took the role of a man was katsotse (boy-girl), and the Mohave give women the term hwame. The cross-gender roles have less to do with sexuality than with spirituality and occupation. A [...] "two-spirit" [...] woman who has a relationship with a non cross-gender woman is thought to be a [...] "hetero-gender" [...] relationship.|$|E
500|$|Other {{variants}} {{may have}} a [...] "U" [...] for [...] "unsure"; a [...] "C" [...] for [...] "curious"; another [...] "T" [...] for [...] "transvestite"; a [...] "TS", or [...] "2" [...] for [...] "two-spirit" [...] persons; or an [...] "SA" [...] for [...] "straight allies". However, the inclusion of straight allies in the LGBT acronym has proven controversial as many straight allies {{have been accused of}} using LGBT advocacy to gain popularity and status in recent years, and various LGBT activists have criticised the heteronormative worldview of certain straight allies. Some may also add a [...] "P" [...] for [...] "polyamorous", an [...] "H" [...] for [...] "HIV-affected", or an [...] "O" [...] for [...] "other". Furthermore, the initialism LGBTIH has seen use in India to encompass the hijra <b>third</b> <b>gender</b> identity and the related subculture.|$|E
500|$|Arjuna {{himself is}} an example of gender variance. When Arjuna refused her amorous advances, the nymph Urvashi cursed Arjuna; he would become a [...] "kliba," [...] a member of the <b>third</b> <b>gender.</b> Krishna assured Arjuna that this curse would serve as the perfect {{disguise}} for Arjuna during his last year of exile. Arjuna took the name Brihannala and dressed in women's clothes, causing the curse to take effect. Thus Arjuna gained entry into the city ruled by king Virata, where he taught the arts of music, singing and dancing to the princess Uttarā and her female attendees. Doniger describes Arjuna's cross-dressing disguise as a source of comedy in the story, with references to his [...] "hairy arms". In the Padma Purana, Arjuna is also physically transformed into a woman when he requests permission to take part in Krishna's mystical dance, which only women may attend.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I tackle the {{relationship}} between language, knowledge and power. To this end, I try to give some reasons for the non-arbitrariness of some words, {{as well as for}} the non-arbitrariness of grammatical genders in Romance languages, especially Romanian and French. I focus on several specific linguistic structures and uses of particular words in these two languages. I particularly deal with the construction of a <b>third</b> grammatical <b>gender,</b> the neuter, in Romanian, in comparison to the two grammatical genders existing in French, trying to see how the application of Irigaray&iacute;s theory on the gender of nouns functions for Romanian language. There is no <b>third</b> grammatical <b>gender</b> in French, and therefore Irigaray&iacute;s argument is proved to be invalid for Romanian. The questions that lead my analysis are: What corporeality does the <b>third</b> grammatical <b>gender,</b> the neuter in Romanian, point to? How are we to consider neuter words? Is the neuter a necessary and sufficient proof for considering Romanian a less sexist lan- guage? Is the neuter the guarantor of impartiality and equilibrium in a grammatically gendered language...|$|R
