40|$|This project {{develops}} and implements a safe, reliable {{method for}} contactless charging of elec-tric vehicle batteries. The charging system's interface {{to the electric}} utility operates with unity power factor. This system accommodates many battery types by using a novel, large signal linear digital controller that can track arbitrary current profiles. Non-ohmic charging occurs through a two part, high frequency transformer. The primary side of the charging transformer remains outside the vehicle, and mates with a secondary installed in the vehicle. The scheme for impressing an AC signal on the primary of <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>connector</b> involves lossless MOSFET switching in a high frequency inverter, and operates {{in the presence of}} high leakage inductance. Capacitive coupling enables contactless feedback of information from the battery in the secondary to the unity power factor charging supply in the primary...|$|E
40|$|As the {{technology}} used in electric vehicles continues to advance, {{there is an}} increased demand for urban-appropriate electric charging stations emphasizing a modern user interface, robust design, and reliable functionality. Publicly shared transportation systems provide electric vehicles with further synergies by allowing for less energy consumption per capita and decreased car congestion. Unfortunately, existing charging platforms are not designed for proper adoption in a public setting and tend to be vulnerable to potential safety hazards and vandalism. Our product, smartCharge, addresses the need for electric charging in a Mobility-on-Demand transportation system. The connector interface design proposed allows for a modular approach for charging various publicly shared electric vehicles, while using a current-controlled locking mechanism with up to 250 pounds of force. Additionally, the connector {{is linked to the}} charging post through a stainless steel retractable arm, which is composed of a spring-loaded pulley mechanism. This paper discusses the design and manufacturing processes for <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> <b>connector</b> and retractable arm, while elaborating on the overall functionality of smartCharge. Finally, the implementation strategy and key considerations for deploying this technology are briefly discussed. by Jean Mario Nations Martin. Thesis (S. B.)

5000|$|The {{connector}} manufacturer Mennekes {{had developed}} a series of 60309-based connectors that were enhanced with additional signal pins - these [...] "CEEplus" [...] connectors {{have been used for}} charging of electric vehicles since the late 1990s. With the resolution of the IEC 61851-1:2001 control pilot function (aligned with the SAE J1772:2001 proposal) the CEEplus connectors were replacing the earlier Marechal couplers (MAEVA / 4 pin / 32 A) as the standard for electric vehicle charging. When Volkswagen promoted its plans for electric mobility Alois Mennekes contacted Martin Winterkorn in 2008 to learn about the requirements of <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> equipment <b>connectors.</b> Based on requirement of the industry led by utility RWE and car maker Daimler a new connector was derived by Mennekes. <b>The</b> state of <b>charging</b> systems along with the proposed new connector were presented at the start of 2009. This new connector would later be accepted as the standard connector by other car makers and utilities for their field tests in Europe. This choice was supported by the Franco-German joint council on E-mobility in 2009. The proposal is based on the observation that standard IEC 60309 plugs are rather bulky (diameter 68 mm / 16 A to 83 mm / 125 A) for higher current. To ensure easy handling by consumers the plugs were made smaller (diameter 55 mm) and flattened on one side (physical protection against polarity reversal). Unlike the Yazaki connector, however, there is no latch, meaning consumers have no exact feedback that the connector is properly inserted. The lack of a latch also puts unnecessary strain on any locking mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|SAE is {{developing}} a Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector with additional pins to accommodate fast DC charging at 200-450 volts DC and up to 90 kW. This will also use Power Line Carrier technology to communicate between <b>the</b> vehicle, off-board <b>charger,</b> and smart grid. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche, Volvo and Volkswagen) had agreed to introduce <b>the</b> [...] "Combined <b>Charging</b> System" [...] in mid-2012. The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014.

50|$|Likewise, only {{second to}} the BMW i3 REx, the 53 mi all-electric range is the second longest-range {{achieved}} by any plug-in hybrid car available for sale. Chevrolet expects that many 2016 Volt owners will run on battery only for 90% of their daily trips, up from 80% for the first generation owners based on OnStar data and other studies. To increase the electrically driven miles, the Volt would need better <b>charging</b> capabilities. <b>The</b> Volt's onboard <b>charger</b> can only handle 3.6 kW though, which is sufficient for overnight <b>charging</b> at <b>the</b> owner's home but falls short of the capabilities of public chargers.

Two weeks later BMW has opened its first CCS rapid charge station in support of the upcoming BMW i3. On occasion of the second EV World Summit in June 2013 both a Chademo and a Volkswagen-group spokesperson have pointed out that a concurrency between Chademo and CCS is not required as the additional cost of a dual-protocol rapid charge station is a mere 5% - thus multi-standard DC chargers are being advocated by Chademo, Volkswagen and Nissan.|$|R
