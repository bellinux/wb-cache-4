2500|$|At {{the state}} level, California {{was the first}} state to offer paid family leave {{benefits}} for its workers. While the benefits only last for 6 weeks [...] this is the first major step for maternity leave in the United States. New Jersey lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make their state the second state to add this worker benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state’s <b>temporary</b> <b>disability</b> insurance fund, [...] "augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers’ weekly wages." [...] Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change. Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National Pro-Life Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having abortions. According to Heyman, [...] "Across the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families.

6000|$|My nearest {{literary}} neighbor, when {{we lived}} in Sacramento Street, was the Rev. Dr. John G. Palfrey, the historian of New England, whose chimney- tops amid the pine-tops I could see from my study window when the leaves were off the little grove of oaks between us. He {{was one of the}} first of my acquaintances, not suffering the great disparity of our ages to count against me, but tactfully and sweetly adjusting himself to my youth in the friendly intercourse which he invited. He was a most gentle and kindly old man, with still an interest in liberal things which lasted till the infirmities of age secluded him from the world and all its interests. As is known, he had been in his prime one of the foremost of the New England anti-slavery men, and he had fought the good fight with a heavy heart for a brother long settled in Louisiana who sided with the South, and who after the civil war found himself disfranchised. In this <b>temporary</b> <b>disability</b> he came North to visit Doctor Palfrey upon the doctor's insistence, though at first he would have nothing to do with him, and refused even to answer his letters. [...] "Of course," [...] the doctor said, [...] "I was not going to stand that from my mother's son, and I simply kept on writing." [...] So he prevailed, but the fiery old gentleman from Louisiana was reconciled to nothing in the North but his brother, and when he came to return my visit, he quickly touched upon his cause of quarrel with us. [...] "I can't vote," [...] he declared, [...] "but my coachman can, and I don't know how I'm to get the suffrage, unless my physician paints me all over with the iodine he's using for my rheumatic side." ...|$|E
