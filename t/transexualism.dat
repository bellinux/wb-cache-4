Neither category took up much space, and few books stood between them, since the Library of Congress system classifies feminism and homosexuality together in Subclass HQ, “The Family. Marriage. Women. ” That subclass has filled out rapidly in the past forty years, {{and in the past}} two decades much of the growth has been in HQ 74 ‐ 77 —“Bisexuality. Homosexuality. Lesbianism. Transvestism. <b>Transexualism.</b> ” Books that once huddled together for warmth on a few shelves now proudly occupy many linear feet in most major research collections. Paralleling the growth of gay studies has been the even more substantial increase within HQ 1101 ‐ 2030. 7 : “Women. Feminism. ...|$|E

The first case regards a 66 years old male who {{was affected by}} a renal metastasis from thoracic cage chondrosarcoma. The use of intraoperative ultrasounds permits to highlight atypical sonographic features of the secondary lesion that were not seen in preoperative radiologic exams and that are completely different from the usual renal lesions. The second case regards the treatment of prostatic abscess performed by echoguided transperineal puncture in which the use of transrectal ultrasound probe permits a precise and correct placement of the needle and the drainage {{in order to obtain}} a fast relief of the symptomatology. The third case shows the role of intraoperative ultrasounds in the localization of a parathyroid adenoma in a 52 years old male affected by primary hyperparathyroidism and with recurrent renal colics. In this case the blind surgical exploration of the parathyroid gland and so the possibility of iatrogenic lesions to the recurrent laryngeal nerve were avoided by the use of the intraoperative sonography for the identification of the adenoma. At the same time the operation times were reduced. The last case underlines the importance of using intraoperative ultrasounds in the real-time monitoring for the creation of the neovagina in sex reassignment surgery in male-to-female <b>transexualism</b> in order to avoid a dangerous postoperative complication represented by the iatrogenic lesion of the rectum during the dissection of the perineal region...|$|E
