Developers began acquiring land, paying $180 an acre in 1968, and the Dade County Port Authority (DCPA) bought [...] in the Big Cypress Swamp without consulting the C, management of Everglades National Park or the Department of the Interior. Park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the jetport from The Miami Herald {{the day it was}} announced. The DCPA bulldozed the land it had bought, and laid a single runway it declared was for training pilots. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined; the location chosen was [...] north of the Everglades National Park, within WCA 3. The deputy director of the DCPA declared: [...] "This {{is going to be one}} of the great population centers of America.

[...] The idea that the Air Force will, in the meantime, acquire another squadron of F-15s {{in order to meet the}} gap that will be created [...] "is not relevant," [...] he said. The delay may mean that in the future there will be more aircraft coming to Israel in a shorter period of time, and the numbers procured may rise from 20 to 30. Israeli defense officials said that the problems with the F-35 were 'much worse than we had been told' and that a high-level delegation would be sent to the United States to determine the extent of the problems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{automatic}} cuts of $1.2 trillion {{resulting from}} {{the absence of a}} deal from the supercommittee over ten years would be split equally between security and non-security programs, and include $500 billion in cuts to the Department of Defense. [...] The FY2013 defense budget would be reduced 11%, from $525 billion to $472 billion, after already having been cut from $571 billion in the first installment of cuts in the Budget Control Act. [...] Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta initially gave the total cut figure as 23%. [...] The planned cuts include reductions in troop levels, a modest limit in pay raises for soldiers starting in 2015, an increase in health fees for veterans, delays in the construction of new naval ships and in the purchasing of new fighter aircraft such as the F-35, and the possibility of a round of base closings within the United States, but cuts to special operations, cyberwarfare, and intelligence programs were avoided. [...] Initial reports had also suggested that the number of carrier battle groups might be reduced from 11 to 10, although it was later determined that the number of aircraft carriers would not in fact be cut. [...] Some Republicans in Congress advocated reversing the cuts to the military, citing the effect on national security, and Secretary Panetta has opposed the cuts, calling them [...] "devastating" [...] and raising [...] "substantial risk of not being able <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>our</b> defense needs." [...] President Obama has promised to veto any legislation seeking to avoid the cuts, and House Speaker John Boehner also indicated his commitment to following the cuts in the Budget Control Act. According to the Center for American Progress, several Presidents have significantly reduced defense spending after wars, without compromising national security. Defense spending in 2011 remained high by historical standards, adjusted for inflation.|$|E
