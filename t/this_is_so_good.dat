Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year.

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, critic Bruce Eder wrote the album [...] "is {{surprisingly}} good, considering {{that it was}} recorded in a huge rush during an era when all concerned couldn't help but know that rock & roll albums (apart from those by Elvis Presley) generally didn't sell very well; indeed, the fact that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> speaks volumes about the class and talent of the group at this early point in their history." ...|$|E

60|$|We shook hands. The name didn’t tell me much. What {{surprised}} {{me was that}} Mills should have remembered mine so well. I don’t want to boast of my modesty {{but it seemed to}} me that two or three days was more than enough for a man like Mills to forget my very existence. As to the Captain, I was struck on closer view by the perfect correctness of his personality. Clothes, slight figure, clear-cut, thin, sun-tanned face, pose, all <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that it <b>was</b> saved from the danger of banality only by the mobile black eyes of a keenness that one doesn’t meet every day in the south of France and still less in Italy. Another thing was that, viewed as an officer in mufti, he did not look sufficiently professional. That imperfection was interesting, too.|$|R

When Enrique says “cause I’m a freAKK” in the chorus and his voice goes up like that…can’t handle. <b>This</b> song <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> And it’s probably the 2014 version of “Timber,” so… ...|$|R

5000|$|Entertainment Weekly {{called it}} [...] "great drama" [...] stating, [...] "It was also {{throwing}} {{us back to}} the type of episode we expected from this show in the early seasons, the type of episode that gave you chills and reminded you why <b>this</b> show <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> at drama."

5000|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Seth Amitin of IGN {{gave the}} episode {{a rating of}} 8.6 out of 10 commenting: [...] "This seemed like an ordinary episode, {{but a lot of}} subversive plot and character development happened and if you've been watching the previous episodes, you probably know why <b>this</b> episode <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> There's a lot to extrapolate." [...] Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "B-", saying: [...] "This episode doesn't have the wow factor that the series has had so far -- it's about moving the pieces into place for long-term strategy." ...|$|R
500|$|Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a glowing review, calling it [...] "the best-yet episode of Veronica Mars". He {{elaborated}} by stating, <b>This</b> episode <b>was</b> just a total triumph for how it brought together SO MUCH {{from the past}} 22 episodes and beyond. I loved the Aaron Echolls assassination. I loved that last image of Duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some Australian beach. I especially loved the It's a Wonderful Life-esque dream sequence. <b>This</b> episode <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that even though I knew Beaver was the bad guy, I still came away shocked {{by many of the}} reveals. That's just good writing right there. Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|R

Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional [...] "black" [...] Turkish coffee.

40|$|Multiplicative {{interaction}} {{models are}} common in the quantitative political science literature. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> for <b>good</b> reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply {{that the relationship between}} political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although con-ditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don’ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10 % of the articles in our survey followed the checklist...|$|R

In the 1966-67 season, the Town reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, in a run which included a famous victory over West Ham United, who boasted three World Cup winners (Moore, Hurst and Peters) in their side. Though Geoff Hurst repeated his Wembley hat-trick at Upton Park, the Town won a replay, before despatching them 3-1 at the County Ground.|$|R
5000|$|Caryn James of The New York Times however praises {{these same}} gothic elements: [...] "Vampires, secrets, {{the mysteries of}} identity: the obsessions that run through the {{director}} Neil Jordan’s films {{are at the center}} of his beautifully enigmatic fifth novel...it is the vampire next door whose menacing presence runs most powerfully through the novel". Her only criticisms relate to the ending, [...] "Most of <b>this</b> book <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> <b>so</b> shimmering with mysteries, that it’s a disappointment when the explanations tumble in. The question of Kevin’s identity is resolved in a banal, practical way, and what happens during his shattering trip to New York seems too lurid and over-the-top for a novel that holds such subtleties. If <b>this</b> <b>were</b> a movie, you might guess that some producer had pressured Jordan to add more drama and a neat clarification — an odd idea, because Jordan's films never underestimate the audience. And almost to the end neither does Mistaken, which shines with a darkly luminous glow".|$|R

40|$|A new {{induction}} heating floating-zone refining (IHFZR) furnace {{was designed and}} constructed using ultrahigh vacuum technology for the ultrapurification of base metals. The ultrahigh vacuum attainable in <b>this</b> furnace <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> as 1 x 10 - 7 } Pa that a base metal bar can be zone-melted in both ultrahigh vacuum and higher-purity gas atmosphere containing less residual gases.

After only two zone-leveling passes in dry hydrogen, oxygen easily decreases in concentration from over 60 mass ppm to a few mass ppm; on the other hand, carbon decreases in concentration not so easily as oxygen but gradually. As a result, ultrahigh-purity Fe- 18 %Cr alloy with the concentration of C+N+O+S of 12 mass ppm and ultrahigh-purity Fe- 50 %Cr alloy with the concentration of C+N+O+S of 10 mass ppm were obtained after only two zone-leveling passes and ten zone-leveling passes in dry hydrogen, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the early}} output was {{supplied}} by just two producers: The Darling brothers, who formed Codemasters {{as soon as they}} could break their contract with the company, and Mr. Chip Software who continued to write games for Mastertronic for some time. Mastertronic never employed in-house programmers to write games. Everything that was published had been produced either by other software houses or by freelance authors. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> an ideal approach for the fast output of many diverse games. At this time thousands of bedroom programmers were trying to get rich quickly by writing games. While <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not <b>so</b> <b>good</b> for creating a consistent throughput of a series or for developing highly complex games, one huge advantage was that it kept overheads low and outsourced the risks of software development to others. Mastertronic did employ specialists to review and test games, to encourage and assist authors and to provide technical expertise. As well as permanent staff temporary assistance came from several of game authors, including Nigel Johnstone, Richard Aplin, Stephen N Curtis and Tony Takoushi.|$|R
