5000|$|The {{concurring opinion}} {{addressed}} {{the use of}} the SCA by the government to request that Warshak's ISP retain emails it would have otherwise deleted. Section 2703(f) of the SCA, according to Judge Keith, should have no prospective effect.The government's request that the ISP preserve Warshak's stored and future email communications without notifying Warshak is analogous to <b>tapping</b> his <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> without a warrant. This type of action would not survive a challenge under the Fourth Amendment: [...] "The government cannot use email collection as a means to monitor citizens without a warrant [...] than they can <b>tap</b> a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> to monitor citizens without a warrant."However, because Judge Keith's interpretation of § 2703(f) did not affect the outcome of the case, he concurred in the result.|$|R
5000|$|When {{his father}} {{declared}} bankruptcy in 1954, Cornwell quit Oxford {{to teach at}} Millfield Preparatory School; however, {{a year later he}} returned to Oxford, and graduated in 1956 with a (First Class Honours) Bachelor of Arts degree. He then taught French and German at Eton College for two years, becoming an MI5 officer in 1958. He ran agents, conducted interrogations, <b>tapped</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> and effected break-ins. Encouraged by Lord Clanmorris (who wrote crime novels as [...] "John Bingham"), and whilst being an active MI5 officer, Cornwell began writing his first novel, Call for the Dead (1961). Cornwell has identified Lord Clanmorris as one of two models for George Smiley, the spymaster of the Circus, the other being Vivian H. H. Green. [...] As a schoolboy, Cornwell had first met Green when he was the Chaplain and Assistant Master at Sherborne School (1942-51). The friendship continued after Green's move to Lincoln College, where he tutored Cornwell.|$|R

As {{well as the}} hired hit-man, British police also believed {{that there was another}} individual - believed to be a Seychellois - who knew Hoarau and was able to identify him to the foreign assassin. Neither Hoarau’s assassin nor his accomplice has been caught. British police did arrest a number of individuals who confessed to working for an Irish private detective, Ian Withers, and were responsible for <b>tapping</b> Hoarau’s <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Telephone</b> <b>tapping</b> (also {{wire tapping}} or {{wiretapping}} in American English) is the monitoring of telephone and Internet conversations {{by a third}} party, often by covert means. The wire tap received its name because, historically, the monitoring connection was an actual electrical <b>tap</b> on the <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> Legal wiretapping by a government agency is also called lawful interception. Passive wiretapping monitors or records the traffic, while active wiretapping alters or otherwise affects it.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{his release}} in 1953, Blake {{returned}} to Britain as a hero, landing at RAF Abingdon. In October 1954 he married MI6 secretary Gillian Allan in St Mark's Church (North Audley Street) in London. In 1955, {{he was sent}} by MI6 {{to work as a}} case officer in Berlin, where his task was to recruit Soviet officers as double agents. He informed his KGB contacts of the details of British and American operations. This included Operation Gold, in which a tunnel into East Berlin was used to <b>tap</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> used by the Soviet military. Until Blake's treachery was discovered, this operation had been hailed as a resounding success. It is claimed that in the course of nine years he betrayed details of some 40 MI6 agents to the KGB, destroying most of MI6's operations in Eastern Europe, though this remains unsubstantiated. Blake later said of this, [...] "I don't know what I handed over because it was so much". In 1959 Blake became aware of a Central Intelligence Agency mole inside GRU, and was thus instrumental in exposing P. S. Popov, who was executed in 1960.|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} and unofficial <b>tapping</b> of <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> is widespread. In the United States for instance, the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that all telephone and VoIP communications {{be available for}} real-time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Two major telecommunications companies in the U.S.—AT&T Inc. and Verizon—have contracts with the FBI, requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies, in return for $1.8 million per year. Between 2003 and 2005, the FBI sent out more than 140,000 [...] "National Security Letters" [...] ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers' calling and Internet histories. About half of these letters requested information on U.S. citizens.|$|R
40|$|With {{the growth}} of the Internet, more and more people want their {{computers}} to be connected to the Internet and to get information from the Internet as fast as possible. Presently available remote network access methods are limited in speed and cannot support simultaneous voice transmission. They do not fully satisfy the Internet users' needs. This thesis presents a new high speed network access technology. With this method, a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> can be used to connect home computers at 230 kbits/s to the Internet without loss of the voice service. In order to put this system in practical use, some problems, such as the interference between the voice and data, the limited transmission distance and the effect of a bridged <b>tap</b> on the <b>telephone</b> <b>line,</b> must be solved. These problems and their solutions have been discussed in this thesis...|$|R

5000|$|Since Gilbey {{was known}} to have been {{speaking}} from a mobile phone, inside a parked car, this left Dianas <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> at Sandringham as the source of the recording. Nelsons analysis, written after a visit to Mr Reenan and an examination of his unsophisticated receiving system (which consisted essentially of an Icom wideband scanning receiver and a conventional television antenna), showed that the recording was most likely to have been made {{as a result of a}} local <b>tapping</b> of the <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> somewhere between the female partys telephone itself, and the local exchange. Furthermore, narrow-band spectrum analysis showed this 50 Hz [...] "hum" [...] to consist of two separate but superimposed components, possibly indicating a remixing of the tape after the initial recording. The spectral frequency content of the tape was demonstrably inconsistent with its supposed origin as an off-air recording of an analogue cellular telephone channel but quite feasible if the recording had been made via a local-end direct tap.|$|R
50|$|The quick {{losses of}} ships {{elicited}} substantial fears of cipher security compromise in the Kriegsmarine and the B-Dienst. Admiral Kurt Fricke, Director of Naval War Command, undertook {{a thorough investigation}} {{with a number of}} different theses to explain the losses. The first of these was coincidence, i.e. the ships could have been spotted by a Royal Navy ship, especially in a busy area like the Bay of Biscay particularly as the Royal Navy ruled the waves {{at the start of the}} war, but was ruled out. Secondly, Admiral Fricke looked at the possibility of a spy, but evidence was lacking. Direction finding was also investigated and the French agents could have <b>tapped</b> the Kriegsmarine <b>telephone</b> <b>lines,</b> but both were discarded, again through lack of evidence. Fricke lastly looked at the possibility of enemy cryptanalysis, which he considered the most serious.|$|R

German academe was shocked to learn that Heinrich Fink, professor of theology and vice-chancellor of East Berlin's Humboldt University, had been a Stasi informer since 1968. After Fink's Stasi connections came to light, he was summarily fired. Doctors, lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, and sports figures were co-opted by Stasi officers, as were waiters and hotel personnel. <b>Tapping</b> about 100,000 <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> in East Germany and West Berlin around the clock was the job of 2,000 officers...

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{differences}} in sociodemographic characteristics associated with health in individuals {{with and without}} a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> METHODS: Data from the ISA-Capital 2003 (2003 Health Survey), a study performed {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, were analyzed. Residents who had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were compared to those who reported not having a <b>telephone</b> <b>line,</b> according to sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and health service use variables. Bias associated with noncoverage of the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> was estimated, decreasing after the use of post-stratifi cation adjustments. RESULTS: Of all the 1, 878 interviewees aged more than 18 years, 80. 1 % had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> By comparing groups, the main sociodemographic differences among individuals who did not have a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were the following: younger age, greater proportion of black and mixed individuals, smaller proportion of married interviewees, and greater proportion of unemployed individuals with a lower level of education. Residents without a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> had fewer health tests performed and smoked and drank more. In addition, this group took less medication, considered themselves to be in worse health conditions and used the SUS (National Health System) more frequently. When excluding the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> from the analysis, estimates of dental consultations, alcoholism, drug use and SUS use to have a Papanicolaou test performed were those showing the highest bias. After post-stratifi cation adjustment, there was a decrease in the bias of estimates for the variables associated with ownership of a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The exclusion of residents without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> {{was one of the main}} limitations to the studies performed in this way. However, the use of statistical techniques of post-stratifi cation adjustment enables a reduction in non-coverage bias...|$|R
