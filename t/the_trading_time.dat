On the other hand, weekends have significant impacts for the TAIEX index. Our findings imply that for the UK and US markets, much less relevant information is produced during weekends, while more relevant information continues to be produced during other types of non-trading periods.

The paper examines the multifractality of index price series on daily data of Nikkei 225, All Ordinaries, Hang Seng, KLSE Composite and Straits Times Index. Wavelets, short form waves with local support are used for time/scale decomposition of financial time series. The multifractal spectrum (MFS) of daily index prices is calculated with Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima method described in Yalamova (2003). The MFS may reveal trading time irregularities suggested by the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (Calvet & Fisher, 2002). <b>The</b> <b>trading</b> <b>time</b> deformation process may uncover information on the efficiency of the trading system that would be useful for regulatory and reorganization purposes. Multifractals describe the cascade of volatility of returns and are suited for research at different time scales simultaneously unlike ARCH type models. In addition, this method provides dimension estimates for the detection of emerging chaotic patterns. The Hurst exponent calculated from the scaling function indicates persistence in volatility of index returns.

40|$|Open-to-open, close-to-close, open-to-close (trading) and close-to-open (non-trading) {{time periods}} are {{examined}} for dually and non-dually listed stocks {{in an attempt}} to explain the volatility patterns which were observed in the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The time period analysed covers the 1997 calendar year. The intraday volatility pattern for the New Zealand Stock Exchange showed similar results to previous studies performed on large exchanges around the world. That is, when the return variances are plotted against <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>time</b> they follow a distinct U-shaped curve, caused by high volatility at the opening and closing of the market. Previous studies have found that the high volatility experienced {{at the opening of the}} market results from the long non-trading period prior to the opening. This was examined by analysing the open-to-open to close-to-close variance ratio for both dually and non-dually listed stocks. The explanation that the long non-trading period prior to the opening of the market is a major cause of the volatility experienced at the market opening is not supported by the results found in this study. The results obtained from this study show that the high volatility at the market opening is associated with high capitalised stocks. A low open-to-close (trading) to close-to-open (non-trading) variance ratio was observed in the New Zealand market. Previous research has attributed this low ratio to dually listed stocks continuing to trade during the non-trading overnight period of the domestic market. The findings in this study contradict this explanation and suggest that it is low capitalised stocks that are associated with the low trading to non-trading variance ratio observed in the New Zealand Stock Exchange...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} non-dealer security markets that offer automated, computer-based, continuous trading reflects a presumption that institutionally-set trading sessions are economically obsolete. This theoretical paper investigates {{the effect of}} the trading frequency, a key feature of the trading mechanism, on the efficiency of price discovery in a non-dealer market. By tracing the market pricing error to the correlation structures of arriving information and pricing errors of individual traders, the effect of diverging expectations on error-based and overall return volatility is isolated. The analysis reveals that, due to a portfolio effect, an increase in <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>time</b> interval has contradictory effects on the portion of return volatility stemming from pricing errors. The greater accumulation of information increases error-based return volatility, but the greater volume and number of traders per session have the opposite effect. The net effect on overall return volatility can go either way. It is found that the return volatility of heavily traded securities is likely to be minimized under continuous trading, but that of thinly traded securities may be minimized under discrete trading at moderate time intervals. The latter is more likely to occur the greater is the divergence of expectations among traders. These findings challenge the presumption that automated continuous trading in a non-dealer market is more efficient than discrete trading for all securities, regardless of trading volume. The findings are applicable to all economies, but have special importance for developing countries where typically a single market is dominated by small issues and a low volume of trade. As a by-product of the analysis, it is shown how to correct the biased estimate of inter-session price volatility when observations are less frequent than the trading sessions themselves.

VIX {{can be thought of}} as a weighted average of implied volatilities for put/call options across a series of strikes. Volatility Skew/Smile phenomenon result from volatility expected discrepancies between various exercise prices. We adopt <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>time,</b> but not the expiration time, as time axis in IVS construction, this is helpful to observe relative daily variations between VIX and volatility skew. On this volatility contour plane, we observe characteristics of "VIX location line" (i. e. zero value relative with daily VIX index) in various VIX levels, and find out its flow path is independent of VIX level, but relate to underlying index variation. We then define DLTvix as Black-Scholes Delta deviation between ATM and VIX location line projection component along Delta moneyness axis. We state that DLTvix can be considered as option participators'expectation on underlying index return over the next 30 calendar days. For the put (call) option, DLTvix is negative (positive); and the lower (higher) value of DLTvix, represents the less (more) expected return. We calculate DLTvix and RT 30 (index return over the next 30 calendar days) from 2006 / 12 / 01 to 2010 / 02 / 28, a total of 802 trading days. These results computed by OLS regression model show that, DLTvix have statistically significant predictive power on RT 30.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five studies on empirical {{aspects of the}} market microstructure on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (StSE). The first study presents a stock pricing model which talkes trading and non-trading time effects into account. The model provides a framework for an empirical analysis of daily returns as well as trading/non-trading time returns of the OMX-index. The {{results show that the}} process generating the OMX-prices seems to be non-normal, discontinuous and serially correlated. Most noteworthy {{is the fact that the}} behaviour of the Monday returns appear to deviate from other weekday returns. The analysis shows that the OMX-index returns appear to be generated by a more complicated process than is usually assumed in e. g. conventional option pricing theory. In the second study, it is argued that the interplay between stock market participants and trading mechanisms gives rise to friction in the market prices. This makes the observed market prices differ from the intrinsic equilibrium values of the stocks. A model for explaining the process by which prices adjust towards their equilibrium values is presented. Accordingly the presence of friction causes the returns to be more volatile and serially correlated. The theoretical model is used to emphasise the persistence of the friction on an intradaily basis on the StSE. A set of data, comprised of OMX-prices obtained evay 15 th minute during the daily trading session, i used. Daily 24 -hour returns are calculated in different time intervals during the day: open-to-open, intraday-to-intraday and close-to-close. Evidence of different OMX-return generating distributions is found. In particular, the variances of the returns terminating at the beginning of the day are higher compared to the variances of the returns terminating during the middle and towards the end of the day. This implies that there is comparatively more noise in the pricing process just after the opening of the StSE. The third study investigates the profitability and riskiness of stock index arbitrage between the StSE and the OM. Transactions prices of standarised forward contracts, with the OMX-index as the underlying security, and minute-by-minute transactions prices as well as bid-ask quotes of the OMX-index are observed. Several deviations from the cost-of-carry relationship are reported. However, these arbitrage signals do not always give rise to realised profits. Instead, the specific structures of the stock and forward market impose restrictions on index arbitrage The results show that the size of an observed arbitrage signal appears to be a poor predictor of the actual outcome. The restrictions on index arbitrage, especially the settlement risk, are shown to make the strategies risky rather than riskless. The fourth study examines the effects of the extended trading session at the StSE. The variance of OMX-index stock returns is estimated over trading and non-trading time periods, as well as on a 24 -hour basis, before and after this event. The variances of the corresponding OMX-forward returns are also estimated and used as a benchmark. The results show that the ratio of trading/non-trading time return variances has increased. It is argued that this increase is due to the extended trading time period pes se, since the same phenomenon can not be observed at the forward market. Since the development of the overall 24 -hour variance appears to be unaffected by the extension, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that information is the main source behind the variance of stock returns and inconsistent with the idea that noise trading genrates some of the variance. The fifth study investigates the dynamic behaviour of trading and non-trading time conditional variance of the OMX-index stock and forward returns, using a dynamic GARCH specification. The results show that the conditional variance during both trading and non-trading time depend mainly on the return shocks eminating from trading time. Evidence of a leverage effect in the conditional variance is found during both trading and non-trading time. The study also investigate the effects on the GARCH specification of <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>time</b> extension at the StSE. The extension of the trading hours has affected the relative levels of the unconditional index return variances for trading and non-trading time, but not their dynamic GARCH processes...|$|E
