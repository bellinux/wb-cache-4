5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had been called to extract the others.|$|E

25|$|March 26: Shalhevet Pass, age 10 months, {{was shot}} dead by member of the Tanzim militant group at the {{entrance}} to the Avraham Avinu neighborhood in Hebron. The murder shocked the Israeli public because the official investigation ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> sniper had intentionally aimed for the baby.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Israeli and Palestinian historiographies {{differed}} on {{the interpretation}} of the events of 1948: in the West the majority view was of a tiny group of vastly outnumbered and ill-equipped Jews fighting off the massed strength of the invading Arab armies; it was also widely believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs left their homes on the instruction of their leaders.|$|E
50|$|Hedding {{believes}} Israel proven {{its desire}} {{to reach a settlement}} with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> while granting political rights to its Arab citizens within a democratic system. Nevertheless, he says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> remain committed to Israel's destruction.|$|R

25|$|This {{situation}} {{caused the}} US to withdraw {{their support for}} the Partition plan, thus encouraging the Arab League to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could {{put an end to the}} plan for partition. The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948, to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{after the}} Islamist militant {{organization}} Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh publicly announced {{his intention to}} free Ze'evi's assassin squad members. On 14 March 2006, the American and British guards left the Jericho jail, charging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority was not sticking to the agreement reached with Israel four years earlier. As a result, Israel launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods on the same day.|$|E
25|$|Sisi also stipulated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority {{would take}} {{power in the}} Gaza Strip in future peace plans and {{conditioned}} an easing of transit restrictions at the Rafah checkpoint {{on the presence of}} a force from the Palestinian Authority's Presidential Guard being stationed on the Gaza side of the crossing as the Sisi administration considers Hamas an enemy, blaming them for the killing of 16 Egyptian soldiers in 2012 and over the alleged involvement in the prisons' storming in the wake of Egyptian Revolution of 2011.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Dabesh in Lebanese daily Al Akhbar {{wrote that}} Voll didn't mention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Zionist entity was {{born out of}} {{aggression}} against <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> and <b>the</b> rape of their land, attacked the Zionist Archaeology policy, and stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> have roots dating back until at least the stone age, 4000 BCE.|$|R
50|$|During a {{visit to}} South Africa in 2013, President Mahmoud Abbas stunned reporters and Palestinian activists by stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> do not support a general boycott of Israel. He supported, however, a boycott of {{settlement}} products.|$|R
2500|$|Danny Danon stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> {{failed to}} make {{concessions}} during the negotiations period {{and that they were}} only interested in seeing militants released from prison.

25|$|Up to 100,000 Arabs, {{from the}} urban upper and middle classes in Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, or Jewish-dominated areas, {{evacuated}} abroad or to Arab centres eastwards. This situation caused the U.S. to withdraw {{their support for the}} Partition plan, thus encouraging the Arab League to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could {{put an end to the}} plan for partition. The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948 to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.|$|E
25|$|The High Commission is {{mandated}} to help refugees {{get on with}} their lives as quickly as possible, and works to settle them rapidly, most frequently in countries other than those they fled. UNRWA policy, however, states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs who fled from Israel {{in the course of the}} 1948 war, plus all their descendants, are to be considered refugees until a just and durable solution can be found by political actors. UNRWA was specifically designed not to proscribe how the outcome of an agreement would take shape.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{appointment}} of Abbas, the U.S. administration promoted the Road map for peace—the Quartet's plan to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict by disbanding militant organizations, halting settlement activity and establishing a democratic and peaceful Palestinian state. The {{first phase of the}} plan demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority suppress guerrilla and terrorist attacks and confiscate illegal weapons. Unable or unwilling to confront militant organizations and risk civil war, Abbas tried to reach a temporary cease-fire agreement with the militant factions and asked them to halt attacks on Israeli civilians.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> and Israel {{have agreed}} on the {{principle}} of a land swap. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in exchange for keeping settlement blocs is an issue of dispute, with <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> demanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ratio be 1:1, and Israel insisting that other factors be considered as well.|$|R
5000|$|According to Efraim Karsh, Divine sees many common {{links between}} Zionist state {{building}} and the situation facing <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> comparing <b>the</b> roles of the Histadrut in Israel with that of Hamas and other voluntary bodies in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> [...] "entity". She asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in <b>the</b> West Bank and Gaza [...] "have created a more vibrant civil society {{than at any other}} time in their history".|$|R
5000|$|Joel Fishman of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, in {{reviewing}} Barghouti's 2010 book, says, regarding <b>the</b> land, <b>that</b> [...] "Barghouti argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> have inalienable rights, while {{those of the}} Jews were acquired, even if they received international recognition" [...] which he says [...] "makes <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> more equal than the Jews, and historically is wrong".|$|R
25|$|Mahmoud Abbas {{was under}} {{pressure}} {{by the international}} community, who considered Hamas' unacceptable as it was perceived to undermine decades of international efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Therefore, the international community decided to boycott the Hamas-led government by severing diplomatic ties and halting financial aid until Hamas would fulfill certain conditions. It was suggested that Abbas could use his constitutional powers to dismiss the government and call for new elections, which were intended to yield a different result and reinstall Fatah in power on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> electorate would perceive Hamas as a failure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, American {{intellectual}} Noam Chomsky argued that Israeli claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> leadership rejected the international consensus {{calling for a}} Palestinian state, with borders along the Green Line, were {{not consistent with the}} documented record. In 2008 Al Jazeera and Haaretz both reported that elements in the Palestinian leadership, even inside Hamas, have called for a two-state settlement based on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line). Although Hamas' official policy is committed to Israel's destruction, Ismail Haniya, the prime minister of the Palestinian unity government until June 2007, suggested that a long-term truce with Israel could be achieved if Israel withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Peled—member of the Left Camp of Israel Executive {{for the whole}} of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf—claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> leadership, {{representing}} its entire people, could not be expected to make in a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if and when it came to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP—with Peled and Avnery at its head—became a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction.|$|E
2500|$|Hussein Ibish, a Senior Research Fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, {{mentioned}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> terminology <b>that</b> {{was usually}} used regarding <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> United Nations application was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> seek recognition from the United Nations, which he claims is meaningless. He wrote that: [...] "The United Nations doesn't recognise states; states recognise each other. The United Nations has member states".|$|R
5000|$|His {{approach}} to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict included a call for peaceful negotiations between Israeli Jews and Palestinians. Israel could not be regarded only as a colonial-settler state but a national fact too. Israeli Jews had collective rights <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> had to honour: ...|$|R
50|$|The Israeli Government claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> brought <b>the</b> stones {{with them}} and staged the {{incident}} as a political provocation.The Temple Mount is a paved plain that usually has few if any stones. But at this time construction work did provide some stones.|$|R
25|$|Assad {{believed}} that Syria's {{defeat in the}} Six-Day War was Jadid's fault, and the accusations against himself were unjust. By this time Jadid had total control of the Regional Command, whose members supported his policies. Assad and Jadid began to differ on policy; Assad {{believed that}} Jadid's policy of a people's war (an armed-guerrilla strategy) and class struggle had failed Syria, undermining its position. Although Jadid continued to champion {{the concept of a}} people's war even after the Six-Day War, Assad opposed it. He felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> guerrilla fighters had been given too much autonomy and had raided Israel constantly, which in turn sparked the war. Jadid had broken diplomatic relations with countries he deemed reactionary, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Because of this, Syria did not receive aid from other Arab countries. Egypt and Jordan, who participated in the war, received £135million per year for an undisclosed period.|$|E
25|$|Ze'evi's assassins {{were able}} to flee {{the scene of the}} crime. For a while they were hiding in the Mukataa {{compound}} in Ramallah, under the auspices of Yasser Arafat. Eventually, during Operation Defensive Shield in which Israeli forces sieged the Mukataa compound, an agreement was reached whereby Ze'evi's assassins were transferred to the Jericho prison under the supervision of British and American guards. After the Islamist militant organization Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh publicly announced his intention to free Ze'evi's assassin squad members. On 14 March 2006, the American and British guards left the Jericho jail, charging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority was not sticking to the agreement reached with Israel four years earlier. As a result, Israel launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods on the same day in which the IDF captured Ze'evi's assassins. Consequently, Ze'evi's assassins were tried in Israel, convicted and received long prison terms.|$|E
25|$|At the Israeli Cabinet {{meeting the}} {{following}} day, both Begin and Eitan belittled intelligence {{reports that the}} likely culprit was the Abu Nidal group. Begin cut short his own advisor on terrorism, arguing that all Palestinian terrorists {{were members of the}} PLO, while Eitan ridiculed the intelligence staff for splitting hairs and demanded to strike at the PLO. Yet Abu Nidal had broken with Arafat and PLO in 1974 over a fundamental principle: namely, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> national movement would adopt a phased piecemeal approach to secure a Palestinian state and embark on a political path. The lack of understanding of the difference between Palestinian groups and the total ignorance of Palestinian politics on the part an overwhelming majority of Israelis and Jews played into the hands of those who did not wish to distinguish between the PLO and the Abu Nidal group. Thus, instead of an initiative to locate the Abu Nidal group in Damascus or Baghdad, the plan to invade Lebanon was activated.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{after the}} Palestine Papers were made public, Buttu {{called for the}} {{resignation}} of Saeb Erekat, <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> chief negotiator, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> documents revealed how “out of touch and unrepresentative” <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> negotiators were. In a 2011 interview, Buttu contradicted claims she had made frequently by saying that she was aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> {{had been willing to}} give up West Bank territory to the Israelis as part of a peace agreement.|$|R
30|$|It {{is obvious}} {{that this is not}} a Palestinian decision; Israel is the one who holds the keys to this issue. While it is {{necessary}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> agree on ending the political division, Israel has a vested interest in keeping the status quo.|$|R
50|$|Dore Gold, {{the former}} Israeli {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, stated by looking at negotiation documents <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> always wanted to have East Jerusalem as their permanent, long-term capital and never intended to accept Abu Dis as a permanent substitute to Jerusalem. Abu Dis was merely meant to be <b>the</b> provisional, temporary <b>Palestinian</b> capital before <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> acquired East Jerusalem in future negotiations.|$|R
