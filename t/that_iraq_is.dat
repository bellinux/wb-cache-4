2500|$|Ritter again {{promoted}} a conciliatory approach toward Iraq in the 2000 documentary , {{which he wrote}} and directed. The film tells {{the history of the}} UNSCOM investigations through interviews and video footage of inspection missions. In the film, Ritter argues <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "defanged tiger" [...] and that the inspections were successful in eliminating significant Iraqi WMD capabilities.

2500|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{was rated}} 57% {{conservative}} and 43% liberal {{on foreign policy}} issues by the National Journal. Ros-Lehtinen supported President George W. Bush's surge policy in Iraq, supports Israel, and supports continued sanctions against Cuba. She also supported the de facto government in Honduras, headed by Roberto Micheletti, that emerged after the military coup against President Manuel Zelaya. She has said {{of the decision to}} invade Iraq: [...] "Whether or not there is a direct link to the World Trade Center does not mean <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> not meritorious of shedding blood. The common link is that they hate America." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reid took an {{aggressive}} approach to defending his government's international policy. Speaking {{ahead of a}} conference on NATO modernisation in Germany on 4 February 2006, Reid asserted in a press interview that [...] "no institution has the divine right to exist". Similarly on 19 March 2006, in response to former interim Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi's claim <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> {{in the grip of}} civil war, Reid defended the British Government's contrary view. He stated: [...] "Every single politician I have met here [...] from the prime minister to the president, the defence minister and indeed Iyad Allawi himself said to me there's an increase in the sectarian killing, but there's not a civil war and we will not allow a civil war to develop".|$|E
2500|$|... "And, of course, {{sophisticated}} {{delivery systems}} aren't {{required for a}} chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. And that {{is the source of}} our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{found it}} {{interesting}} that on the tape Iraq was mentioned, which is a reminder <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the war}} against extremists. If Al-Qaeda bothers to mention Iraq, it's because they want to achieve their objectives in Iraq, which is to drive us out.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} attacks, rumors began <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{could have played}} a role. The state-run Iraqi media praised the attacks but denied <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> responsible.

40|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the US {{invasion}} of Iraq, I did not believe, and said so in public, <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> in any way directly responsible for 9 / 11, or that the Iraqi regime had any substantive links with al-Qa'ida, or that it <b>was</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> actually able to field weapons of mass destruction. I believed <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> had probably tried to obtain weaponsgrade plutonium, and I knew that it had actually obtained centrifuges from Germany, as well as the means to manufacture chemical and biological weapons from Germany and the US. I surmised, from a position of total scientific ignorance, <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> probably possessed most of the ingredients necessary to manufacture weapons of mass destruction, but that it was some way off from actually doing so...|$|R
5000|$|Iraq's {{ambassador}} to Pakistan Dr. Rushdi Al-Ani claimed <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> considers Pakistan [...] "a Muslim super power" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> willing to supply Pakistan with oil unconditionally.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} given to Newsweek International published July 24, 2006, Albright gave her opinion on current U.S. foreign policy.

5000|$|The {{lack of any}} official, government-established Sharia {{courts in}} Iraq, {{and the use of}} the phrase [...] "a {{principal}} source of legislation" [...] rather than [...] "the principal source of legislation" [...] in the Iraqi constitution, has been understood [...] to mean <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> not a constitutional theocracy, at least according to Hirschls definition.|$|E
5000|$|Her National Interest article {{appeared}} in expanded form in Study of Revenge: Saddam Hussein's Unfinished War Against America (2000). Mylroie later claimed that [...] "the Clinton White House {{did not want}} to hear <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> behind the bombing." ...|$|R

5000|$|Likewise, the {{implication}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> {{involved in the}} 9-11 attacksor {{had weapons of mass}} destruction, based on evidence that the CIA's own reports had dismissed, was described as [...] "policy by press release" [...] by John Kerry and Lou Dobbs.|$|R
50|$|Jordanian leaders worry <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming}} {{a haven for}} terrorist groups, a fear dramatically heightened by the November 2005 suicide bombings in Amman.

5000|$|In an October 2002 posting ISIS {{published}} a report which said [...] "One {{of the most}} significant accomplishments of the intrusive inspections mandated by UN Security Council in 1991 is <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> not believed to have nuclear weapons now.

5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "civil war" [...] has been controversial, with a number of {{commentators}} preferring the term [...] "civil conflict".A poll of over 5,000 Iraqi nationals found that 27% of polled Iraqi residents agreed <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> in a civil war, while 61% thought <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> not.
