5|$|Above the <b>transport</b> <b>layer,</b> {{there are}} certain {{protocols}} that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and <b>Transport</b> <b>Layer</b> Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.

5|$|The Heartbeat Extension for the <b>Transport</b> <b>Layer</b> Security (TLS) and Datagram <b>Transport</b> <b>Layer</b> Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the <b>Transport</b> <b>Layer</b> Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the precursor from which charge <b>transport</b> <b>layers</b> are formed can significantly affect the device performance of organic solar cells. Here, we compare two common precursors {{that are used}} to generate titania electron <b>transport</b> <b>layers</b> and elucidate their effects on the transient characteristics of inverted bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells comprising poly(3 -hexyl hiophene) and [6, 6]-phenyl-C- 61 -butyric acid methyl ester. Substituting the isopropyl ligands of titanium isopropoxide with 2 -methoxyethanol leads to electron <b>transport</b> <b>layers</b> that require a shorter illumination time to fill shallow electron traps. Furthermore, organic solar cells with titania electron <b>transport</b> <b>layers</b> prepared with such pre-modified titania precursor exhibit higher power-conversion efficiencies stemming from lower trap densities.

Developing new material chemistry and custom-tailoring processing and properties of charge <b>transporting</b> <b>layers</b> based on oxide nanocrystals {{hold the key to}} boosting the efficiency and lifetime of all-solution-processed light-emitting diodes and solar cells, and thereby realizing an unprecedented generation of high-performance, low-cost, large-area and flexible optoelectronic devices. This review aims to bridge two research fields, chemistry of colloidal oxide nanocrystals and interfacial engineering of optoelectronic devices, focusing on the relationship between chemistry of colloidal oxide nanocrystals, processing and properties of charge <b>transporting</b> <b>layers</b> and device performance. Synthetic chemistry of colloidal oxide nanocrystals, ligand chemistry that may be applied to colloidal oxide nanocrystals and chemistry associated with post-deposition treatments are discussed to highlight the ability of optimizing processing and optoelectronic properties of charge <b>transporting</b> <b>layers.</b> Selected examples of solution-processed solar cells and light-emitting diodes with oxide-nanocrystal charge <b>transporting</b> <b>layers</b> are examined. The emphasis is placed on the correlation between the properties of oxide-nanocrystal charge <b>transporting</b> <b>layers</b> and device performance. Finally, three major challenges {{that need to be addressed}} in the future are outlined. We anticipate that this review will spur new material design and simulate new chemistry for colloidal oxide nanocrystals, leading to charge <b>transporting</b> <b>layers</b> and solution-processed optoelectronic devices beyond the state-of-the-art.

5|$|At the <b>transport</b> <b>layer,</b> most {{communication}} adopts {{either the}} Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E

25|$|The <b>transport</b> <b>layer</b> {{performs}} host-to-host communications {{on either}} the same or different hosts and {{on either the}} local network or remote networks separated by routers.

Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers).

A particular operating system or platform will often have two well-defined software interfaces: one between the media and <b>transport</b> <b>layers,</b> and one between the <b>transport</b> <b>layers</b> and applications. The media-to-transport interface defines how transport protocol software makes use of particular media and hardware types ("card drivers"). For example, this interface level would define how TCP/IP transport software would talk to Ethernet hardware. Examples of these interfaces include ODI and NDIS in the Microsoft Windows and DOS environment. The application-to-transport interface defines how application programs {{make use of the}} <b>transport</b> <b>layers.</b> For example, this interface level would define how a web browser program would talk to TCP/IP transport software.
