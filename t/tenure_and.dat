5|$|In the 1850s, some tenant farmers formed {{associations}} {{to demand}} the three Fs: fair rent, fixity of <b>tenure,</b> <b>and</b> free sale. In the 1870s, the Fenians tried to organise the tenant farmers in County Mayo to resist eviction. They mounted a demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to lower his rents.|$|E
5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short <b>tenure,</b> <b>and</b> because {{most of it was}} {{together}} with his brother.

Roz is also pursuing the tenured position, and she views herself as a serious competitor for <b>tenure</b> <b>and</b> for replacing Sue on the Cheerios. She believes Sue's coaching style and cheerleading choreography is old-fashioned, and plans to update the team if she becomes the new coach.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} {{to identify the}} relationship between <b>tenure</b> security <b>and</b> food security. The literatures on <b>tenure</b> issues <b>and</b> food security issues are not well connected and the scientific evidence on the causal links between <b>tenure</b> security <b>and</b> food security is very limited. The paper explores the conceptual linkages between land tenure reforms, <b>tenure</b> security <b>and</b> food security and illustrates how these vary across diverse contexts. The paper then reviews {{the limited number of}} high quality studies that contribute to a causal chain analysis between <b>tenure</b> security <b>and</b> food security and identifies important research gaps...|$|R

5|$|Aberdeen {{approached}} Craig Brown, who {{was working}} without a contract at Motherwell, to replace McGhee. Brown initially rebuffed an offer, but after further discussions with the club Brown resigned as manager at Motherwell to be announced as the next manager at Aberdeen two days later. The first act of the new management team of Brown and Archie Knox was to re-instate Leighton. Aberdeen failed to produce better results under Craig Brown's <b>tenure,</b> <b>and</b> in March 2013 he announced his retirement {{to take up a}} non-executive director role on the club's board.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{service as}} sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell {{described}} {{the time in}} office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his <b>tenure</b> <b>and</b> chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who {{had been convicted of}} murdering his mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself; he hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their <b>tenure</b> <b>and</b> for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of <b>tenure,</b> <b>and</b> free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E

5|$|Partly in {{response}} to economic pressures {{and in order to}} protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land <b>tenure</b> <b>and</b> workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary. Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was finally}} {{allowed to return}} to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state and issued his {{resignation}} from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short <b>tenure</b> <b>and</b> his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.|$|E
5|$|Sue reveals {{her desire}} to become a mother and asks Will to be the sperm donor.
