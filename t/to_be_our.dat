5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

25|$|Around the 1880s and {{increasingly}} through into the Edwardian era, {{an adaptation of}} the riding coat called a Newmarket coat (now renamed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> 20th century morning coat) began to supplant the frock coat as daytime full dress. Once considered a casual equestrian sports coat, the morning coat started to slowly become both acceptable, {{and increasingly}} popular, as a standard day time full dress alternative to the frock coat, a position which the morning coat enjoys to this day.|$|E

25|$|This is {{primarily}} a book for the mind, {{in the sense that}} it requires deep thought and study, and does not appeal so directly to our emotional or devotional side as do Baba's short messages and exhortations to His followers. It is, in essence, a divine cosmology, a Map of the Evolving Universe, in which we all play a part, to help us find the quickest and shortest route home—to our Beloved God, Who Is found, on Realization, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> very own Self.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Bell stated on the {{way that}} the season had tied in with the films, [...] "we got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are {{incumbent}} upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran {{as much as the}} guy on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E
500|$|Although Miller was on {{the roster}} for all three series in the Cardinals' 2013 postseason run, manager Mike Matheny did not place him in the {{starting}} rotation. [...] Instead, he totaled a single inning in one relief appearance against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2013 National League Division Series (NLDS), in which he gave up one home run. [...] Matheny rebuffed the suggestion {{that he was a}} [...] "misspent asset" [...] on the 25-man roster. [...] He specified that, [...] "He's going to be a guy we’re going to use if we get into a situation where we’ve got a bunch of innings to eat up, whether it's at the front end or back. [...] He's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> guy (if) we have to put things together." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1903 Pankhurst {{believed}} that years of moderate speeches and promises about women's suffrage {{from members of}} parliament (MPs) had yielded no progress. Although suffrage bills in 1870, 1886, and 1897 had shown promise, each was defeated. She doubted that political parties, with their many agenda items, would ever make women's suffrage a priority. She even broke with the ILP when it refused to focus on Votes for Women. It was necessary to abandon the patient tactics of existing advocacy groups, she believed, in favour of more militant actions. Thus on 10 October 1903 Pankhurst and several colleagues founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organisation open only to women and focused on direct action to win the vote. [...] "Deeds," [...] she wrote later, [...] "not words, was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> permanent motto." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think {{it took us a}} while to find it but I think we found the right song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] to be something that people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a new husband from the royalty of Europe. However, when her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine, began negotiations with Archduke Charles of Austria without her consent, she angrily objected and the negotiations foundered. Her own attempt to negotiate a marriage to Don Carlos, the mentally unstable heir apparent of King Philip II of Spain, was rebuffed by Philip. Elizabeth attempted to neutralise Mary by suggesting that she marry English Protestant Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Sir Henry Sidney's brother-in-law and the English queen's own favourite), whom Elizabeth trusted and thought she could control. She sent an ambassador, Thomas Randolph, to tell Mary that if she would marry an English nobleman, Elizabeth would [...] "proceed to the inquisition of her right and title <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> next cousin and heir". The proposal came to nothing, not least because the intended bridegroom was unwilling.|$|E
500|$|According to the 19th-century {{historian}} William Forbes Skene, {{the contract}} is evidence of an ancestral connection between clans Gregor and MacAulay. Within the bond, both Ardincaple and Glenstrae stated that they were offshoots of the same family: [...] "Alexander M'Gregor of Glenstray on the ane part and Awly M'Cawley of Ardingapill {{on the other part}} understanding ourselfs and our name to be M'Calppins of auld and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> just and trew surname". Skene was of the opinion that the MacAulays did not descend from the Mediaeval earls of Lennox, and further concluded that Clan MacAulay was a member of Siol Alpin – a group of clans which could claim descent from Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín) whom Scots considered to be their first king. Later historians have shown that such bonds were used by the MacGregors to secure allegiances with weaker clans, and that such a bond was may have been forced upon the MacAulays by the more powerful MacGregors.|$|E

500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. On March 13, 2008, during the broadcast of the sixth season, the network renewed the show for a seventh season, with 26 episodes in order. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon & MTVN Kids and Family Group, said, [...] "The strength of the Nickelodeon brand comes from how we embrace everything important to kids, and how we are with them virtually everywhere they want us <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Our</b> open philosophy to give audiences access to everything they love, and our commitment to making relevant and innovative content, have put us at the top of cable, VOD and online.

500|$|Philip Tilden, Churchill's architect, {{began work}} on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a {{farmhouse}} near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, {{and a series of}} construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, [...] "My beloved, I beg you not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> home (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years." [...] Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924, a letter dated 17 April of that year to Clementine begins, [...] "This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and it is right that it should be to you".|$|E
500|$|On the season's {{potential}} for crossover {{with the rest}} of the MCU, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "I think [...] year worked really well—we got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us. Ant-Man comes out this summer and will have come and gone before we air again in September, so whether there's anything vestigial from that or for [...] next season is to be determined. But we're in contact with the movie people and them with us, and any time we can put little easter eggs in, it's a lot of fun for die-hard fans." [...] Bell also stated that there was a possibility of Hayley Atwell once again reprising her role as Peggy Carter in the season for an Agent Carter crossover, and after the series acknowledged the character's death in Civil War, added, [...] "Any time we can make a connection to her, whether in a flashback or dealing with what’s happening now, it makes the universe smaller." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of British punk rock's leading figures {{made a show}} of rejecting {{not only}} {{contemporary}} mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated music predecessors: [...] "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977", declared the Clash song [...] "1977". The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural [...] "Year Zero". Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan [...] "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, [...] "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England." [...] While [...] "self-imposed alienation" [...] was common among [...] "drunk punks" [...] and [...] "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the [...] "radical leftist utopianism" [...] of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer's outlook, [...] "Punk rock is meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> freedom. We're meant {{to be able to do}} what we want to do." ...|$|E
