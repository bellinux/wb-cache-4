5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant Genetic Resources Institute), the International Institute of <b>Tropical</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement of Banana and Plantain. Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and international efforts to preserve agricultural genetic resources through off-site methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|E

40|$|The University of Hohenheim in West Germany {{has set up}} a {{regional}} research programme which will produce and improve agricultural production technologies targeted on small-scale farmers in West Africa. Work is now underway at various collaborating centres, including ICRISAT'S's Sahelian Centre in Niger, at the International Institute for <b>Tropical</b> <b>Agriculture's</b> headquarters in Nigeria and at the Institute's regional research station in Benin. Current projects are evaluating the physiological and agronomic bases of alleycropping systems in terms of stabilizing food crop yields. Particular attention is being paid to methods of stabilizing yields of cassava and maize under conditions where crop rotations and fallow periods can no longer be operated. Work has concentrated on two improved varieties, cassava TMS 30572 and maize TZESRW. Alley cropping generally helps to conserve soil moisture, reduce water stress, and improve soil fertility by returning minerals and organic matter to the soil. Competition from weeds also tends to be reduced. Intercropping trials with Leucaena lecuocephala and Cajanas cajan (pigeon pea), both leguminous, soil-enriching plants, have produced mixed results. On the poor, acidic, red oxisols of the field trials site, leucaena showed poor initial growth and rapid signs of nutrient deficiency, whereas, under the same conditions, pigeon pea exhibited healthy growth and a rapid build-up of dry matter. Both intercropping regimes resulted in increased yields, and it is hoped to extend the trials to different ecological zones using different farming systems.
