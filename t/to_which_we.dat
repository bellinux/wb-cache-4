I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement {{to be the most}} important final goal <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> must devote ourselves.|$|E

I surmise that brackish or fresh water might be obtainable there, and likewise good firewood, but not without great trouble.|$|E
25|$|The {{positioning}} of images in virtual space leads naturally to an order, furthermore, an order <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are naturally accustomed as biological organisms, deriving {{as it does}} from the sense perceptions we use to orient ourselves in the world. This fact perhaps sheds light {{on the relationship between}} the artificial and the natural memory, which were clearly distinguished in antiquity.|$|E

25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E
25|$|Perturbation {{theory is}} an {{important}} tool for describing real quantum systems, {{as it turns out}} to be very difficult to find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for Hamiltonians of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, we can use the known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.|$|E
5000|$|This may {{be shown}} by {{constructing}} a surjective homomorphism of Lie groups from SL(2,C) <b>to</b> SO+(1,3), <b>which</b> <b>we</b> {{will call the}} spinor map. This proceeds as follows: ...|$|R

25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E
25|$|During the {{religious}} peace which followed {{the persecution of}} Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is Adversus haereses (Against Heresies). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may {{have taken place in}} Asia Minor or in Rome. However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of 'Marcus the Magician' living and teaching in the Rhone valley.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} {{straightforward}} case, {{such as the}} sampling of a batch of material from production (acceptance sampling by lots), it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include {{any one of them}} in our sample. However, in the more general case this is not usually possible or practical. There is no way to identify all rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, {{there is no way to}} identify which people will actually vote at a forthcoming election (in advance of the election). These imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> could apply statistical theory.|$|E
6000|$|Thirdly, let us {{suppose that}} we have {{selected}} another Adjunct, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> may call [...] "y", and have subdivided the x-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are [...] "y" [...] and [...] "y'", and {{that we have}} assigned the North-West Cell <b>to</b> the one (<b>which</b> <b>we</b> may call [...] "the xy-Class"), and the North-East Cell <b>to</b> the other (<b>which</b> <b>we</b> may call [...] "the xy'-Class").|$|R
5000|$|For finite ordinals, the nim-sum {{is easily}} {{evaluated}} {{on a computer}} by taking the bitwise exclusive or (XOR, denoted by [...] ) of the corresponding numbers. For example, the nim-sum of 7 and 14 can be found by writing 7 as 111 and 14 as 1110; the ones place adds to 1; the twos place adds <b>to</b> 2, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> replace with 0; the fours place adds <b>to</b> 2, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> replace with 0; the eights place adds to 1. So the nim-sum is written in binary as 1001, or in decimal as 9.|$|R

500|$|There were {{attempts}} at compromise. The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, {{contrary to the}} Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, [...] "I will suffer death before I consent... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> have a constitutional right." ...|$|E
500|$|Princess Elizabeth went in 1947 on {{her first}} {{overseas}} tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: [...] "I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> all belong." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1913, Innis started {{classes at}} McMaster University (then in Toronto). McMaster {{was a natural}} choice for him {{because it was a}} Baptist {{university}} and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate. Innis was especially influenced by James Ten Broeke, the university's one-man philosophy department. Ten Broeke posed an essay question that Innis pondered {{for the rest of his}} life: [...] "Why do we attend to the things <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> attend?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{disappointed}} not to {{have seen}} any action during the night of D-Day, and still unsure of their actual impact, the bomber crews felt proud of the operations. Squadron Leader Les Munro of No. 617 Squadron wrote, [...] "I have always considered the operation in one sense {{to be the most}} important the squadron carried out in my time– not because [...] bad weather, nor because of any threat of enemy action and not measured by any visible results, but because of the very exacting requirements <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> had to fly and navigate".|$|E
500|$|Under {{the title}} of our neighbour, there is yet a duty of a more large, {{extensive}} nature incumbent on us – our love to our neighbour is his public capacity, as {{he is a member}} of that greatly body, the Commonwealth, under the same government with ourselves, and this is usually called love of the public, and is a duty <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are more strictly obliged than even that of loving ourselves, because wherein ourselves are also contained – as well as all our neighbours – is one great body.|$|E
30|$|In Section 5, we {{will give}} an {{existence}} result of the truncation system (2.3). The proof {{will be based on}} the following well-known fixed point result due <b>to</b> Krasnoselskis, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> state without proof (compare [8, 9]).|$|R
60|$|In the {{manuscript}} from <b>which</b> <b>we</b> draw {{many of these}} particulars, it is stated that he who exceeds his neighbors {{in the number of}} his wives, male children, and slaves, is elected chief of the village; a title <b>to</b> office <b>which</b> <b>we</b> do not recollect ever before to have met with.|$|R

We sailed all the way north to Northumberland, where we plundered, and thence to Scotland, where we marauded far and wide. Then {{we went to the}} Hebrides and fought some battles, and after that south <b>to</b> Man, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> herried. We ravaged far around in Ireland, and steered thence <b>to</b> Bretland, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> laid waste with fire and sword--also the {{district}} of Cumberland. Then we went to Valland, [the west coast of France] from <b>which</b> <b>we</b> fared away for the south coast of England, but missed it and made the Scilly Isles. After that we went to Ireland again, and came to a harbour, into <b>which</b> <b>we</b> ran--but in a friendly way, for we had as much plunder as our ships could carry.|$|R
