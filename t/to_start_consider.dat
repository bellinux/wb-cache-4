40|$|Abstract—A {{geographically}} {{continuous movement}} {{model can be}} deduced from the quadratic transshipment problem by considering the transportation network as a discrete mesh. The resulting system of coupled Helmholz equations can be considered to solve simultaneously the spatially continuous versions of the traffic “distribution ” and “assignment ” problems. The associated Lagrangian functions {{are similar to the}} potentials of classical flow theory. Numerical methods implement the procedure. This work uses a sequence of elementary discrete geographic movement models to lead to an equivalent spatially continuous version, which then involves potential fields describable by a system of partial differential equations. One departure from classical results {{is that there is a}} different potential for gross and for net movements, the one allowing for simultaneous movement in more than one direction at each place. The models solve the “distribution ” and “assignment” problems of transportation and traffic engineering. The irregular and awkward geographic topologies encountered in practice require that numerical methods be used for solution of the system of equations. <b>To</b> <b>start,</b> <b>consider</b> a simple journey-to-work problem.

40|$|We {{formulate}} Hamiltonian vector-like lattice {{gauge theory}} using the overlap formula for the spatial fermionic part, Hf. We define a chiral charge, Q 5 which commutes with Hf, {{but not with}} the electric field term. There is an interesting relation between the chiral charge and the fermion energy with consequences for chiral anomalies. Lattice gauge theory and chiral symmetry represent two venerable non-perturbative approaches in particle theory. Historically, however, they have not easily meshed. In particular, the old species doubling problem forces one to insert chiral symmetry breaking somewhere into the regulator. The issues involved are deeply entwined with anomalies [1]. Stimulated by the domain wall fermion idea of Kaplan [2] and the overlap formulation of Neuberger and Narayanan [3], this topic has recently seen renewed attention and dramatic progress. Here we explore an adaptation of the overlap idea to the Hamiltonian formalism. We find an interesting operator structure and a simple intuitive picture of how anomalies work in terms of a fermion eigenvalue flow. <b>To</b> <b>start,</b> <b>consider</b> the conventional “contin-∗ This manuscript has been authored under contract number DE-AC 02 - 98 CH 10886 with the U.

Knowing when an appliance is powered on is required for identifying recurrent patterns that could later be under-stood as activities. Leveraging activity knowledge over time will allow us to design personalized energy efficient mea-sures.
