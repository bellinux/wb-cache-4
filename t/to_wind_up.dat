Indeed, that company was wound up on 17 January 1908, {{although}} {{the reasons for this}} are unclear. Charles Henry Prideaux was appointed to represent the company on the liquidation committee for Leitner Electrical Company Ltd in 1915.|$|E
5|$|One of {{her first}} acts in the post was to help launch an Irish Council for Civil Liberties booklet {{offering}} advice to older people on their rights concerning retirement, access to health and community care, pensions, and elder abuse. Shortly after this she was faced with one {{of her first}} major tasks when she was called on {{to play a role in}} helping <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the affairs of Console, a suicide bereavement counselling charity, after the organisation was plunged into crisis by a scandal involving the misuse of funds. McEntee worked with the charity's chief executive to ensure the services it provided would continue to be available. Console's functions were taken over by Pieta House in July 2016.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October, Kaupthing {{was placed}} into {{receivership}} by the FME, following {{the resignation of}} the entire board of directors. The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration. Kaupthing's Luxembourg subsidiary asked for, and obtained, a suspension of payments (similar to chapter 11 protection) in the Luxembourg District Court. Kaupthing's Geneva office, which was a branch of its Luxembourg subsidiary, was prevented from making any payments of more than 5000 Swiss francs by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. The directors of Kaupthing's subsidiary on the Isle of Man decided <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company after consultation with the Manx authorities. The Finnish Financial Supervision Authority, Rahoitustarkastus, announced having taken control of Kaupthing's Helsinki branch already on 6th, to prevent money from being sent back to Iceland.|$|E

25|$|February saw the US dollar fall to {{its lowest}} level since 1973, based on {{comparison}} against a weighted basket composed of the currencies of its major trading partners and analysts began to converge on {{the view that the}} Feds QE2 program would begin <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> {{by the middle of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|The records {{after the}} {{elimination}} {{round of the}} tournament was carried over in the Governor's Cup. The Pals retained their winning way and advanced to the finals in a rematch with the Zoom Masters.

25|$|Many urban legends are framed as {{complete}} stories with plot and characters. The compelling {{appeal of a}} typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, horror, fear or humor. Often they serve as cautionary tales. Some urban legends are morality tales that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in trouble, hurt, or dead.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 1996, all the MPs from Kerala {{visited the}} Prime Minister and pleaded {{with him to}} {{expedite}} the CBI investigation. However, on 6 December 1996 the CBI filed a petition in the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court Ernakulam seeking <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> its investigation in the matter for lack of evidence. The court rejected the request and directed the CBI to continue the investigation.|$|E

50|$|The House of Lords held clearly {{preferential}} shares {{were not}} debentures, they are equity, because the 5% preference {{would not be}} paid {{if there was no}} profit, whereas a 5% interest rate would have to be. To calculate their entitlement on <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> the court should begin the process of construction with a presumption of equality. Since it was deemed that the provision on 5% extra dividends was exhaustive, and there was no indication this should apply <b>to</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> there was no automatic right to more preferential distributions on <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
25|$|Voluntary liquidations {{occur when}} the company's members decide voluntarily <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> {{the affairs of the}} company. This may be because they believe that the company will soon become insolvent, or it may be on {{economic}} grounds if they believe that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.|$|E
25|$|In early 2008 it was {{revealed}} by the administrator, Wilson Field of Sheffield, that Gretna had creditors of nearly £4m and assets (Raydale Park) of £812,000. HM Revenue and Customs was owed nearly £600,000 in total, and it was their threat <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company that precipitated Gretna's move into administration. On 8 May, the administrator set a deadline of 17 May for a buyer to be found, or the club would be liquidated.|$|E
25|$|The keeper was {{required}} to maintain the property, clean and whitewash the tower as required, and maintain the light. In the years before electricity and automation, he was also required to carry the fuel up the stairs in buckets, and, twice a day, <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the clockwork-like mechanism -- with weights and pulleys -- that enabled the weights to rotate the lens. In 1875, the Chantry station's keeper was paid a salary of $400, according to House of Commons records.|$|E

25|$|His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both {{forms of}} the game. By {{the end of his}} career, he had such a {{reputation}} for poor batting that the crowd would cheer every ball he faced. Whether this was in appreciation of his batting or an attempt <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the bowling side is open to interpretation. Walsh is a much loved and respected cricketer and the West Indies have arguably yet to find a fast bowler with anything approaching his talents.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 the {{governing}} board of the Universal League ceased publishing the Bulteno and decided <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> {{the affairs of the}} League itself. The remaining capital was divided among several foundations, with most of the funds going to the World Esperanto Association. Among the grants was found a stock of Stelo coins to be sold through the UEA as collector's items. The death of Dr. Op 't Roodt in 1996 and of Dr. Roelofs in 1998 marked the end of a major Esperantist initiative.|$|E
25|$|Problems with parking for {{extended}} periods of time occurred and in April 1933, parking of cars in New Regent Street was time-restricted to 20 minutes. Around the same time, Regent Street Limited was in financial difficulty and petition <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company was filed, and the judge gave the company a fortnight to pay up, which resolved the issue. Regent Street Limited sold off individual shops in the 1940s until all 40 units were in private ownership. The roadway was transferred to Christchurch City Council, making it a public road, after World War II.|$|E

25|$|In 1883–84, {{inspections}} {{revealed that}} all four Pennsylvania class ships required immediate maintenance to their hulls, which needed strengthening. The repairs {{were carried out}} {{at a cost of}} $25,000 per vessel, but the additional costs probably contributed to the Pennsylvania Railroad's decision <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the American Steamship Company, which because of the after effects of the 1873 panic had always struggled to make a profit. With the demise of the ASC, Indiana and her three sister ships were transferred to management of the PRR's other shipping line, the Red Star Line, but Indiana continued to service her familiar Liverpool–Philadelphia route.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{missed a}} 61-yard field goal <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the opening drive for the Buffaloes {{in the second}} half (he had made it when the play {{initially}} went but it was whistled dead because Colorado State had taken a timeout – {{it would have been the}} longest of his career). Colorado State's Jason Smith missed a 34-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. Colorado failed to answer the Rams {{in the second half}}. The defense played quite well, recording many sacks and limiting the Rams. The missed field goal and missed chance at a field goal along with a near perfect performance by Hanie proved costly to the Buffaloes.|$|E
25|$|The Mavs won 55 {{games and}} the Southwest Division title, but for the 3rd time in four years, they failed to escape the first round. The 2007 Mavericks were {{defeated}} by the Golden State Warriors as a No. 1 seed, and the 2008 Mavericks lost in the 1st round to the New Orleans Hornets. The Mavs took Game 1 in Dallas, but {{would go on to}} drop the next three games (including two in San Antonio) <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> trailing 3 to 1. Dallas won Game 5 to keep their season alive, but the Spurs managed to finish them off with a 10-point win in Game 6.|$|E
