Given some breathing room by his lieutenant's all-night combat, on 9 May Beaulieu directed his troops to cross the Adda farther north at Lodi. The Battle of Lodi occurred on 10 May, though Schübirz missed it, having been ordered to march four battalions and four squadrons to Crema.|$|E

25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We will say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now {{we are taking}} n balls, one by one, {{in such a way}} that the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E

Driver distraction was identified as a factor <b>that</b> increases <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of being involved in severe single-truck crashes (OR[*]=[*] 1.894). The result confirmed the research carried out by Bunn [31], which indicated <b>that</b> distraction/inattention increased <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of a fatal motor vehicle collision.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>odds</b> of crash {{severity}} {{were estimated}} to be 2.396 times higher when the truck driver did not follow the speed limit. Although not much {{research has been done}} on the importance of speed compliance in preventing severe truck crashes, many studies showed that increased vehicle speed significantly increased <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of getting involved in severe crashes [32, 33]. Posted speed limit is another speed variable <b>that</b> increased <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of being involved in severe crashes about 70 %.|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We will say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way}} that the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent of what happens to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E
25|$|Zhu Wan's {{unauthorized}} executions of the Zoumaxi captives {{provided an}} excellent opportunity for his political enemies. On April 27, Zhu Wan was impeached for exceeding his authority since executions had to be sanctioned by the emperor. The Jiajing Emperor dismissed Zhu Wan from his post and ordered a full investigation on the matter. Seeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> were against him, especially since his backer Xia Yan had been executed in disgrace in October last year, Zhu Wan wrote his own epitaph and committed suicide by drinking poison in January 1550. The investigation confirmed the allegations that Zhu Wan had killed the prisoners without imperial authorization, and so a posthumous death sentence was handed down. Lu Tang and Ke Qiao were also condemned to death, and the Portuguese smugglers were let off lightly, with exile as their punishment. The ordeal left Galeote Pereira, one of the Portuguese crewmen captured in Zoumaxi, very impressed by what he perceived as the impartiality of the Chinese justice system.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the last}} round Carlsen and Kramnik were the only players who had a shot at winning the tournament. Kramnik with black against Ivanchuk needed to {{outperform}} Carlsen, who had white against Svidler, to win the tournament, since the second tiebreak favoured Carlsen with five wins against Kramnik's four. (The first tiebreak, the head-to-head score between Carlsen and Kramnik, was 1–1.) Carlsen played to win, since that would guarantee him the tournament victory regardless of Kramnik's result; similarly, Kramnik knew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of Carlsen losing with white were minute, and he went all-in against Ivanchuk with the Pirc defense. This backfired and Ivanchuk obtained an early advantage, while Carlsen got a level position against Svidler. Carlsen later got into serious time trouble and did not defend adequately against Svidler's attack, which gave Svidler a winning endgame. Meanwhile, Ivanchuk had outplayed Kramnik, who resigned {{a few minutes after}} Carlsen lost. Thus the tournament was won by Carlsen on the second tiebreak.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, in {{the wider}} context of the Greco-Persian wars, {{it was a very}} {{significant}} battle for the Allies. The Allies had demonstrated to themselves that they could stand up to the Persian navy, even having the better of some encounters. For many of the Allied crews, it was their first taste of battle, and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming Battle of Salamis. Moreover, fighting the Persians at Artemisium allowed the Greek admirals to see how the Persian fleet performed, and gave them insights into how it might be beaten. In addition, the events before and during Artemisium were crucial in cutting down the size of the Persian fleet (even if this was not all due to military action), meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> faced by the Allies at the Battle of Salamis were not overwhelming.

500|$|A common {{objection}} to evolution {{is that it}} is simply too unlikely for life, in its complexity and apparent [...] "design," [...] to have arisen [...] "by chance." [...] It is argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable not to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world, and specifically from the diversity of life. A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures (see the Creation of complex structures section below). The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the [...] "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747"—a claim attributed to astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and known as Hoyle's fallacy. Hoyle was a Darwinist, atheist and anti-theist, but advocated the theory of panspermia, in which abiogenesis begins in outer space and primitive life on Earth is held to have arrived via natural dispersion.|$|E
2500|$|Debate {{persists}} {{over whether}} a British defeat was a guaranteed outcome.

Ellis concludes that, once Howe failed, the opportunity for a British victory [...] "would never come again". Conversely, the United States Army's official textbook argues that, had Britain been able to commit 10,000 fresh troops to the war in 1780, a British victory was within the realms of possibility.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} combining k subjective probability distributions for a quantity of interest θ ∈ Θ.

We also characterize the class of all the pools satisfying the weakly modified axiom.
