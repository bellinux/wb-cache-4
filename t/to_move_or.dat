5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> dead).|$|E
5|$|Reverend Norman Balthus is Brother Justin's mentor. He rescued {{and raised}} young Justin and Iris {{after he had}} found them alone in the wilderness. Late in the first season, Norman grows {{suspicious}} of Brother Justin's inner motivations. He confronts his foster son but does not carry out Brother Justin's plea to kill him. At the beginning of season 2, Norman suffers a stroke leaving him unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> speak. He remains {{in the care of}} Brother Justin and Iris until the carnival sets up near Brother Justin's {{home at the end of}} the series. Ben heals Norman, but the reverend is fatally lacerated by Brother Justin seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E

5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> talk.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

25|$|The {{appeal was}} finally {{withdrawn}} in November 2004, after the Civil Aviation Authority {{confirmed that the}} safety improvements put in place were sufficient to enable the necessary safety zones to be created and permit the return of commercial flights to the airport.

25|$|This {{was seen}} as an election-year move to help Republican {{candidates}} in Western New York.

In dog training, the prey drive {{can be used as}} an advantage because dogs with strong prey drive are also willing to pursue moving objects such as toys, thus encouraging the dog <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> act in a particular way.|$|E
25|$|Chronic tears occur among {{individuals}} who constantly participate in overhead activities, such as pitching or swimming, {{but can also}} develop from shoulder tendinitis or rotator cuff disease. Symptoms arising from chronic tears include sporadic worsening of pain, debilitation, and atrophy of the muscles, noticeable pain during rest, crackling sensations (crepitus) when moving the shoulder, and inability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> lift the arm sufficiently, especially during abduction and flexion motions.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Montgomery {{had passed}} a city {{ordinance}} to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats {{to achieve that}} goal. According to the law, no passenger would be required <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> give up their seat and stand if the bus was crowded and no other seats were available. Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers adopted the practice of requiring black riders to move {{when there were no}} white-only seats left.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to later aircraft, the Vampire had a relatively disorganised cockpit {{that in some}} aspects lacked ergonomic measures; such as the fuel gauges being difficult for the pilot to observe without pulling the control column back. A few controls, such as the low-pressure fuel cock, were known for being difficult <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> were otherwise obstructed by other controls. The pilot was provided with a fairly favourable external view, in part aided by the relatively small size of the Vampire.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} most other turn-based systems where the player {{controls}} the individual actions of every party member, in LMBS, the player only directly controls one main character. Other {{characters in the}} party can be set to passive mode (defend only), active mode and attack (computer controlled), or the player can often force the characters <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> use a spell from the pause menu. For the titles that allow multiplayer, the other party characters can be controlled by other human players.|$|E
25|$|Black labor {{played a}} crucial role in Miami's early development. During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, migrants from the Bahamas and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population. Whatever their role in the city's growth, their community's growth was limited to a small space. When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans in neighborhoods close to Avenue J (what would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang of white men with torches visited the renting families and warned them <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> be bombed.|$|E

25|$|The Wedgwood {{had come}} {{dangerously close to}} the shore and ran the risk of running aground, and also blocked the Haganahs field of fire. Therefore, the Haganah {{initially}} stayed near Majdal while the Wedgwood moved south to chase the corvette. At 12:52, Egyptian combat aircraft appeared on the scene, but did not engage the Israeli vessels. Both the Haganah and the Wedgwood exchanged fire with Egyptian corvette but the Israeli cannons were of low quality and jammed frequently. They registered hits, but did not impair the corvette's ability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> fire back. The corvette was also unable to do damage.|$|E

The library also displays when and where artists are on tour.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy is a {{long-term}} neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>or</b> vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep {{about the same number}} of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be worse.|$|E
