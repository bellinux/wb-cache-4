25|$|Alvarez {{has been}} known for facilitating and {{endorsing}} impeachment efforts against Vice President, Robredo and Supreme Court Chief Justice, Sereno. Alvarez's endorsed impeachment complaint against Robredo came after the Vice President reported to the United Nations the state of the country and the War on Drugs that President Duterte's administration is currently conducting. Alvarez claims that Robredo's act of portraying the country in a bad light is a betrayal of public trust, and thus impeachable. Alvarez has also revealed that <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>will</b> be discussing possible impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Sereno for meddling {{in the case of the}} Congress' detention of Ilocos-6, wherein Sereno granted the right of habeas corpus to the six individuals.|$|E

2500|$|In Federalist No. 70, Hamilton {{counters}} {{claims of}} his desire to recreate the monarchy by outlining the structural {{ways in which the}} president’s power is more limited than the power of a king. He points out that the decisive president will be balanced and checked by a slow and deliberate legislative branch and that the president and the legislative branch will share responsibilities. For example, the president will make appointments and negotiate treaties, while <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>will</b> possess legislative powers and fund and set rules for the military. [...] The Senate serves as a final check by providing (or not providing) its consent for appointments and treaties.|$|E

2500|$|The World Jewish Congress's {{expressed}} {{goal was}} Jewish unity and {{the strengthening of}} Jewish political influence in order to assure {{the survival of the}} Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state. 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, Stephen S. Wise assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: [...] "I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. <b>The</b> <b>congress</b> <b>will</b> not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it." ...|$|E

And <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>will</b> be complicit if we fail to act."California Senator Dianne Feinstein blamed the National Rifle Association's [...] "stranglehold" [...] on gun laws for the attack and said [...] "shame on us" [...] in Congress for failing to do something about it. Pennsylvania Congressman Timothy F. Murphy, a clinical psychologist, said his bipartisan mental health overhaul would be a solution and urged Congress to pass it.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{as people}} at the top level of the party retire, there is room for younger members of the party to move up one level. [...] Hence the party {{congress}} is a time of a general personnel reshuffle, and the climax of negotiations that involve not only the top leadership but practically all significant political positions in Mainland China. [...] Notably, fifth-generation leadership hopefuls Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang will leave vacancies in the top leadership position of Shanghai and Liaoning. In addition, Hubei, Guangdong, Chongqing and possibly Tianjin will all go through regional leadership changes. Because of the pyramid structure of the party and the existence of mandatory retirement ages, cadres who are not promoted at a party congress are likely to face the end of their political careers. Current provincial level officials see the Congress as a chance for promotion to Beijing. <b>The</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>will</b> also be significant in determining the amount of influence still held by former General secretary Jiang Zemin, as reflected by the personnel changes.|$|E
