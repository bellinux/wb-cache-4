As most weapon research in the 1960s no longer involved the Theoretical Division, Mark branched out, sponsoring research into hydrodynamics, neutron physics and <b>transport</b> <b>theory.</b> He also supported Frederick Reines's research into neutrinos, for which Reines was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} proper {{was initiated}} in the 1870s {{with the work}} of Boltzmann, much of which was collectively published in his 1896 Lectures on Gas Theory. Boltzmann's original papers on the statistical interpretation of thermodynamics, the H-theorem, <b>transport</b> <b>theory,</b> thermal equilibrium, the equation of state of gases, and similar subjects, occupy about 2,000 pages in the proceedings of the Vienna Academy and other societies. Boltzmann introduced the concept of an equilibrium statistical ensemble and also investigated for the first time non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, with his H-theorem.|$|E
40|$|To {{know the}} space time {{evolution}} of a heavy ion reaction is of great interest, especially {{in cases where the}} measured spectra do not allow to ascertain the underlying reaction mechanism. In recent times it became popular to believe that the comparison of Hanbury-Brown Twiss correlation functions obtained from classical or semiclassical <b>transport</b> <b>theories,</b> like Boltzmann Uehling Uhlenbeck (BUU), Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD), VENUS or ARC, with experiments may provide this insight. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to show that this is not the case. None of these <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> provides a reliable time evolution of those quantities which are mandatory for a correct calculation of the correlation function. The reason for this failure is different for the different <b>transport</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R
40|$|Relaxation {{phenomena}} in deeply inelastic collisions are qualitatively discussed and compared with precompound reactions. Different approaches for describing these processes are reviewed, {{in particular the}} microscopic <b>transport</b> <b>theories,</b> which can be understood from a generalized master equation for macroscopic variables. The Markoff approximation and the classical limit for the relative motion lead to two coupled equations, the classical equation of relative motion with friction and a Pauli master equation for the internal degrees of freedom. The master equation approximated by the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for mass transfer and energy dissipation is discussed in detail. Simple analytic expressions are derived for the transport coefficients as functions of excitation energy, total mass, mass fragmentation and relative angular momentum. Calculated transport coefficients are compared with experimental values. Problems and future developments in microscopic <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{stiffness}} of the hadronic {{equation of state}} has been extracted from the production rate of K^+ mesons in heavy ion collisions around 1 A GeV incident energy. The data are best described with a compressibility coefficient κ around 200 MeV, a value which is usually called "soft". This is concluded from a detailed comparison {{of the results of}} <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> with the experimental data using two different procedures: (i) the energy dependence of the ratio of K^+ from Au+Au and C+C collisions and (ii) the centrality dependence of the K^+ multiplicities. It is demonstrated that input quantities of these <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> which are not precisely known, like the kaon-nucleon potential, the Δ N → N K^+ Λ cross section or the life time of the Δ in matter do not modify this conclusion.

He worked on nuclear forces, scattering, quantum field theories, collective motion in nuclei, <b>transport</b> <b>theory,</b> and statistical mechanics. Peierls had largely left solid state physics behind when, in 1953, he began collecting his lecture notes on the subject into a book. Reconsidering the way that the atoms in metal crystals are arranged, he noted an instability. This became known as the Peierls transition.|$|E
25|$|In the kinetic theory, heat is {{explained}} in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. The immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy. In microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a <b>transport</b> <b>theory,</b> not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions. An early and vague expression of this was made by Francis Bacon. Precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E

40|$|In the air {{surrounding}} us, {{how does}} a particle diffuse? Thanks to Einstein and other pioneers,it has been well known that generally the particle will undergo the Brownian motion, {{and in the last}} century this insight has been corroborated by numerous experiments and applications. Another fundamental question is how the energy carried by a particle diffuses. The conventional <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> assumed the Brownian motion as the underlying energy transporting mechanism, but however, it should be noticed that in fact this assumption has never been tested and verified directly in experiments. Here we show that in clear contrast to the prediction based on the Brownian motion, in equilibrium gases the energy diffuses ballistically instead, spreading in a way analogous to a tsunami wave. This finding suggests a conceptually new perspective for revisiting the existing energy <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> of gases, and provides a chance to solve some important application problems having challenged these theories for decades.

40|$|The successes, {{limitations}} and generalizations of <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> for dissipative heavy-ion collisions are reviewed. The {{evolution of the}} collision complex can be divided roughly into three stages : mutual approach of the nuclei, local equilibration and slow relaxation of macroscopic degrees of freedom. In particular, the last stage has been thoroughly investigated {{within the framework of}} <b>transport</b> <b>theories.</b> The main steps in the derivation of transport equations is discussed and applications of Fokker-Planck equations are presented. Recent developments try {{to bridge the gap between}} the initial stage and the third stage of the process. An important feature of the mutual approach is due to the initial correlations imposed by the ground-state, configurations (doorway) of the colliding nuclei. These correlations give rise to an explicity time-dependent dynamical potential in the relative motion. The resulting modified Fokker-Planck equation is applied to compound-nucleus formation and dissipative collisions. The possible existence and some characteristic features of a slow component of dissipative collisions (besides the familiar fast component) are studied...|$|R

40|$|Solute {{transport}} through {{articular cartilage}} under cyclic loading {{has recently been}} modelled mathematically using porous media and <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> to investigate the role of advection that potentially enhance solute transport through cartilage. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a mathematical model describing the effects of cyclic deformation and ECM binding on solute transport through cartilage. The mechanical and <b>transport</b> <b>theories</b> for porous media are used to model the articular cartilage as a deformable multi-phase mixture. It is assumed that the total solute concentration is comprised of unbound solute in the cartilage fluid phase and solute bound to the solid phase (ECM). The solute in solution can be transported in the interstitial fluid by diffusion and advection or it may bound onto ECM (i. e. to binding proteins). It is shown that at low initial solute bath concentration, ignoring binding effects leads to a significant underestimation of the steady-state solute concentration within the cartilage tissue; however, the influence if binding becomes negligible at high bath concentrations due to the finite number of binding sites. A transient analysis revealed that dynamic compression generally increases both unbound and bound solute concentration in the cartilage, in comparison to free diffusion...|$|R
