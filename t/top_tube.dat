25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, <b>top</b> <b>tube,</b> down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The <b>top</b> <b>tube</b> connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the <b>top</b> <b>tube)</b> to the rear fork ends.|$|E

25|$|Recently, a {{variation}} of the traditional seat stay that bypasses the seat tube and connects further into the <b>top</b> <b>tube</b> was patented by Volagi Cycles. This frame element added length to the traditional design of seat stays, making a softer ride at the sacrifice of frame stiffness.|$|E

50|$|In 2012 Israeli fashion {{designer}} Elie Tahari {{claimed that he}} helped popularize <b>tube</b> <b>top</b> after his arrival in New York in 1971. The original <b>tube</b> <b>tops,</b> as spotted by Tahari in a New York factory run by Murray Kleid, were elasticated gauze tubes reportedly produced through a factory manufacturing error. Murray ran with this product for years and eventually Tahari bought tubes from Kleid, later setting up his own factory to mass produce <b>tube</b> <b>tops</b> to meet widespread demand.|$|R
25|$|The {{additives}} {{may include}} anticoagulants (EDTA, sodium citrate, heparin) or a gel with density between those of blood cells and blood plasma. Additionally, some tubes contain additives that preserve certain components of or substances within the blood, such as glucose. When a tube is centrifuged, the materials within {{are separated by}} density, with the blood cells sinking {{to the bottom and}} the plasma or serum accumulating at the <b>top.</b> <b>Tubes</b> containing gel can be easily handled and transported after centrifugation without the blood cells and serum mixing.|$|R
25|$|Moore's winning bicycle is in Ely City Museum in Cambridgeshire. It has a {{diamond-shaped}} iron downtube and a <b>top</b> <b>tube</b> and tyres of flattened metal. The rest is wood, {{including the}} wheels. The back wheel has {{a diameter of}} 31inches, the front 38inches. The gearing is 1:1 (the pedals connected to the front hub), so the gear is low. The machine's saddle perished and disappeared before the bicycle returned to Britain.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{different}} {{materials can}} provide the desired stiffness, compliance, or damping in different areas better than can be accomplished with a single material. The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal down tube and chain stays with carbon <b>top</b> <b>tube,</b> seat tube, and seat stays. Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon seat stays.|$|E
25|$|Historically, women's bicycle frames had a <b>top</b> <b>tube</b> that {{connected}} {{in the middle}} of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height. This was to allow the rider to dismount while wearing a skirt or dress. The design has since been used in utility bikes to facilitate easy mounting and dismounting for both genders, and is also known as a step-through frame or an open frame. Another style that accomplishes similar results is the mixte.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 Cannondale {{released}} the Six13, a composite carbon/alloy frame that featured an alloy head tube, staysets, and bottom bracket junction mechanically and chemically bonded to carbon seat, down, and <b>top</b> <b>tubes.</b> This was the company's {{first use of}} structural carbon composite material, and subsequent variants of the Six13 have used one to three carbon tubes depending on the price point of the model and the model year. Later, the Six13 line was expanded to include the Slice triathlon/time trial bike which employed similar alloy/carbon joinery with aerodynamically tapered tubes.|$|R
50|$|The unique part {{of ozone}} {{oxidation}} is its in-situ application. Because, unlike other oxidants used in ISCO, it is a gas, {{it needs to}} be injected into the contamination site from the bottom rather than the <b>top.</b> <b>Tubes</b> are built into the ground to transport the ozone to its starting place; the bubbles then rise to the surface. Whatever volatile substances are left over are sucked up by a vacuum pump. Because the bubbles travel more vertically than horizontally, close placement of ozone injection wells is needed for uniform distribution.|$|R

25|$|For higher-powered lights, an {{external}} battery pack of 12V VRLA battery is often required. These battery packs usually strap to the <b>top</b> <b>tube</b> of the frame, or {{come in the}} shape that fits in a water bottle cage, or can {{be placed in a}} basket. A cable connects the battery pack to the light. Another advantage with battery power (especially with 12 volt) is the ability to power other components outside of lighting, as well as all from one battery (as long as they run safe on 12 volts) though wire spaghetti from splicing can be a setback depending on how complicated the electric system is.|$|E
500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the <b>top</b> <b>tube,</b> although some models changed in 2002 to <b>top</b> <b>tube</b> cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} and simultaneous monitoring of relative concentrations of Na, K, Zn and Pb {{as well as}} C, N, O, H, Ca and Fe - being constituents of top gas and dust particles carried therein - is demonstrated by a direct laser measuring in the <b>top</b> gas <b>tube</b> of a blast furnace. The measuring method is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) which uses optical emission spectrometry (OES) of a plasma generated by focussing a laser beam into the top gas stream. The LIBS instrumentation consists of laser, optics, spectrometer and electronics installed in a container near the <b>top</b> gas <b>tube</b> access. An optical probe is installed to enable a traversing of the <b>top</b> gas <b>tube.</b> Due to the CO content of the top gas, safety measures such as monitoring the absence of O 2 inside and CO outside of the <b>top</b> gas <b>tube</b> have been taken. The laser-based instrumentation was set-up and installed for measuring campaigns at three blast furnace sites in Germany, Finland and Spain. On-site measuring periods of up to 10 hours a day with an average measuring value every 10 s were carried out demonstrating the capability of this technique for online measuring tasks in rough industrial environments. The functionality of the system was shown successfully and first correlations of online monitored analytes in the top gas with blast furnace parameters were found...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of fluid {{properties}} on two-phase flow in the vertical header and refrigerant distribution into horizontal branch tubes. R 410 A and R 134 a are used as the working fluid. Refrigerant enters into the header by five microchannel tubes in the bottom pass and exits through the five microchannel <b>tubes</b> in the <b>top</b> pass representing the flow in the outdoor microchannel heat exchanger of reversible systems under heat pump mode. The difference of fluid properties causes the flow pattern and refrigerant distribution results of R 410 A and R 134 a different between each other. Non-dimensional analysis shows that the inertia of R 410 A is {{higher than that of}} R 134 a. At low qualities, when the flow regime is churn, the higher inertia enables <b>top</b> <b>tubes</b> to receive more liquid so that the distribution of R 410 A is a little better than that of R 134 a. At high qualities, when it is likely semi-annular, the higher inertia causes more bottom tubes are bypassed by the liquid film of semi-annular flow. It results in worse R 410 A distribution than R 134 a, though more liquid reaches the <b>top</b> <b>tubes</b> for R 410 A. The coefficient of variation of refrigerant distribution is applied in this study to generalize the results of both R 410 A and R 134 a at various header geometries and inlet flow conditions. A distribution function is derived for predicting R 410 A and R 134 a distribution in future...|$|R
