This leads to the climactic fight between both of Wen's characters, realized through choreographed stunt work and CGI; the crew worked harder to meet the standards of Tancharoen following his acclaimed action work on , including the stunt team, who had worked on <b>that</b> <b>series,</b> and the costume and set designers, who looked to accommodate the fight.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{positive}} initial reviews, which {{praised the}} film as a well-made cinematic transfer of the Thunderbirds television series, Thunderbirds Are Go soon {{proved to be a}} box office failure for the Andersons. The disappointment of this outcome was intensified by the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>Series</b> Two of Thunderbirds would be cut down to six episodes and that AP Films' upcoming television project would be a brand-new series, which would later be titled Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and screened from 1967. To add to the lukewarm public response, negative critical reception of Thunderbirds Are Go has targeted, besides other aspects, the characterisation of the puppet cast, which has been seen as too minimal to sustain a feature-length production, the running time dedicated to model and effects shots, and the fantasy dream sequence starring Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which {{has been described as a}} poor scriptwriting idea on the part of the Andersons.|$|E

After military service in the Second World War, Leyland returned to the Yorkshire team for one season before announcing his retirement from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connection with Yorkshire, and served as the county coach between 1950 and 1963. He died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in <b>that</b> <b>series.</b> He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E

5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on <b>that</b> <b>series.</b> As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
