5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2005–06 season, Graham Westley, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>that</b> {{had brought}} Julian to Stevenage, left the club and was {{replaced}} by Mark Stimson. Stimson signed goalkeeper Danny Potter and stated that Potter would be the club's first choice goalkeeper. Julian was subsequently an unused substitute for Stevenage's first two games of the season. However, after Potter was sent-off in Stevenage's home game against Crawley Town, Julian made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute in a 3–2 defeat. Julian remained first choice goalkeeper from then onwards, making 53 appearances for the club during the 2006–07 season as Stevenage finished eighth in the Conference National. Eight of Julian's appearances during the season came in the club's successful FA Trophy campaign, keeping four clean sheets in the process. He also made a number vital saves in the club's semi-final second leg against Grays Athletic, which Stevenage went on to win by a 3–1 aggregate scoreline.

The win meant that Julian was part of the first team to win a competitive final at the new stadium.|$|E
