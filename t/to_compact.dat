This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought <b>to</b> <b>compact</b> areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of the {{orientation}} of clay particles on diffusion in compacted bentonite, which is regarded to be quite important as a candidate buffer material in safety assessment for a geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste, was experimentally discussed by investigating effective diffusion coefficients (De) for tritiated water (HTO), which is non-sorptive onto bentonite. The diffusion experiments were carried out for 2 kinds of smectite contents of Na-bentonites, Kunigel-V 1 {reg_sign} (content of Na-smectite, 46 - 49 wt%) and Kunipia-F{reg_sign} (content of Na-smectite, > 99 wt%) at dry densities of 1. 0 and 1. 5 Mg/m 3 by a through-diffusion method. The through-diffusion experiments were carried out for the same direction as compacted direction of bentonite and perpendicular direction <b>to</b> <b>compacted</b> direction. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations for the cross section of bentonite in the axial and perpendicular directions <b>to</b> <b>compacted</b> direction of bentonite were also carried out at dry densities of 1. 0, 1. 6, and 2. 0 Mg/m 3. Although De values for Kunigel-V 1 {reg_sign} were approximately the same for both diffusion directions <b>to</b> <b>compacted</b> direction over the densities, and no anisotropy in De was found, De values in the perpendicular direction <b>to</b> <b>compacted</b> direction for Kunipia-F{reg_sign} were clearly higher than those {{in the same direction as}} compacted direction. In the SEM observations, no significant orientation of clay particles was found for Kunigel-V 1 {reg_sign} over the densities, while the orientation of clay particles was clearly found for Kunipia-F{reg_sign}, and the degree of the orientation of clay particles became significant with an increase in dry density of bentonite. This tendency is in good agreement with that for De values obtained, indicating that smectite content in bentonite affects the orientation property of clay particles, and that the orientated clay particles affect diffusion pathway...|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{additional}} instruments {{are used for}} packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order <b>to</b> <b>compact</b> the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process <b>to</b> <b>compact</b> the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.|$|E
