5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held {{every two years}} for {{worldwide}} emergency physicians by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the American College of Emergency Physicians, the British Association for Emergency Medicine, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' emergency medicine organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E

We estimate a structural equation model using survey data from 334 Korean joint ventures and find support for our hypotheses regarding IJV age, knowledge transfers, and performance. Our results show that IJV age is positively associated with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> tacit <b>knowledge,</b> but not with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> explicit <b>knowledge.</b> In contrast, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> tacit <b>knowledge</b> has {{a significant impact on the}} performance of both young and mature IJVs, while the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> explicit <b>knowledge</b> only has a significant effect on the performance of mature IJVs. These results confirm the important role of IJV age as a driver <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> in IJVs, and as a moderator of their effects on performance...|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{exceptional}} {{quality of the}} language program many of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy's students continued their education abroad, {{which at the time}} meant many of them were required to convert from the Orthodox faith to Roman Catholicism.

2500|$|Ultimately, {{academic}} dishonesty {{undermines the}} academic world. It {{interferes with the}} basic mission of education, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> by allowing students to get by without having to master the knowledge. [...] Furthermore, academic dishonesty creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to the learning process, which affects honest students as well. When honest students see cheaters escape detection, it can discourage student morale, as they see the rewards for their work cheapened. Cheating also undermines academia when students steal ideas. Ideas are a professional author's [...] "capital and identity", and if a person's ideas are stolen it retards the pursuit of knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{no longer}} sees the Midlands Enlightenment as primarily having an industrial or technological focus. Analysis of the subject-matter of Lunar Society meetings shows that its main concern was with pure scientific investigation rather than manufacturing, {{and the influence}} of Midlands Enlightenment thinkers can be seen in areas as diverse as education, the philosophy of mind, Romantic poetry, the theory of evolution and the invention of photography. A distinctive and significant feature of the Midlands Enlightenment, however, that partly resulted from Birmingham's unusually high level of social mobility, was the close relationship between the practitioners of theoretical science and those of practical manufacturing. The Lunar Society included industrialists such as Samuel Galton, Jr. as well as intellectuals such as Erasmus Darwin and Joseph Priestley; scientific lecturers such as John Warltire and Adam Walker communicated basic Newtonian principles widely to the town's manufacturing classes; and men such as Matthew Boulton, James Keir, James Watt and John Roebuck were simultaneously highly regarded both as scientists and as technologists, and in some cases also as businessmen. The intellectual climate of 18th century Birmingham was therefore unusually conducive to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> from the pure sciences to the technology and processes of manufacturing, and the feeding back of the results of this to create a [...] "chain reaction of innovation".|$|E
