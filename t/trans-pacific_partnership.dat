5|$|As Prime Minister, Key led the Fifth National Government of New Zealand which entered {{government}} {{at the beginning of}} the late-2000s recession in 2008. In his first term, Key's government implemented a GST rise and personal tax cuts. In February 2011, a major earthquake in Christchurch, the nation's second largest city, significantly affected the national economy and the government formed the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in response. In its second term, Key's government announced a policy of partial privatisation of five state-owned enterprises; while the policy was enacted, voters in a citizens-initiated referendum on the issue were 2 to 1 opposed to the policy. In foreign policy, Key announced the withdrawal of New Zealand Defence Force personnel from their deployment in the war in Afghanistan, signed the Wellington Declaration with the United States and pushed for more nations to join the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2006 summit, {{economist}} C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the proposed parties to any agreement at that time. His ideas convinced the APEC Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, ASEAN and existing free trade agreement (FTA) partners are negotiating as Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), not officially including Russia. The <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TPP) without China or Russia involved has become the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion. President Obama hosted a TPP meeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.|$|E
25|$|The ringgit would {{experience}} more acute plunges {{in the value}} since mid-2014 following the escalation of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal that raised allegations of political channeling of billions of ringgit to off-shore accounts, and uncertainty from the 2015â€“16 Chinese stock market turbulence {{and the effects of}} the 2016 United States presidential election results. The currency's value fell from an average of 3.20 to the US dollar in mid-2014 to around 3.70 by early 2015; with China being Malaysia's largest trading partner, a Chinese stock market crash in June 2015 triggered another plunge in value for the ringgit, which reached levels unseen since 1998 at lows of 4.43 to the US dollar on September 2015, before stabilising around 4.10 to 4.20 to the US dollar soon after; the currency would finally plummet and hover below the 1998 lows since November 2016, between 4.40 and 4.50 to the US dollar, {{in the wake of the}} victory of pro-protectionist Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, which has raised questions of United State's participation in the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (which Malaysia is a signatory of, and the United States had promptly pulled out from in January 2017) and Malaysiaâ€“United States trade as a whole (as the United States is among Malaysia's largest trading partners).|$|E
25|$|Like his predecessor, Obama pursued {{free trade}} agreements, {{in part due}} to the lack of {{progress}} at the Doha negotiations in lowering trade barriers worldwide. In October 2011, the United States entered into free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Congressional Republicans overwhelmingly supported the agreements, while Congressional Democrats cast a mix of votes. The three agreements had originally been negotiated by the Bush administration, but Obama re-opened negotiations with each country and changed some terms of each deal. Obama also promoted two significantly larger, multilateral free trade agreements: the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TPP) with several Pacific Rim countries, and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. TPP negotiations began under President Bush, and Obama continued them as part of a long-term strategy that sought to refocus U.S. power to East Asia. The size and scope of the TPP negotiations grew under Obama until it included twelve countries, including Malaysia, Japan, Mexico, and Canada. The Obama administration received heavy criticism from citizen activists and members of the Democratic Party for the lack of transparency in the negotiations, as well as the presence of corporate representatives who assisted in the drafting process. After years of negotiations, the 12 countries reached a final agreement on the content of the TPP in October 2015, and the full text of the treaty was made public in November 2015. In July 2015, Congress passed a bill giving trade promotion authority to the president until 2021; trade promotion authority requires Congress to vote up or down on trade agreements signed by the president, with no possibility of amendments or filibusters. The TPP became a major campaign issue in the 2016 elections, with both major party presidential nominees opposing its ratification. In January 2017, President Trump signed an executive order pulling the United States out of the TPP negotiations.|$|E

500|$|Among Pritzker's {{priorities}} was the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TPP), {{a proposed}} trade agreement {{that would have}} been the [...] "largest regional trade agreement in history". Pritzker supported the TPP as a way to provide market access to U.S. businesses and as a way for the U.S. to set the standards for trade. Leading up the 2016 presidential election, in which both major party candidates openly opposed the TPP, Pritzker and other Obama officials continued to push for the TPP's passage in Congress. Ultimately, Congress failed to pass the TPP bill.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Clinton {{laid out}} a {{detailed}} economic plan, which The New York Times called [...] "optimistic" [...] and [...] "wide-ranging". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a [...] "clawback" [...] that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, {{rather than focusing on}} short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an [...] "exit tax" [...] on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas. Clinton currently opposes the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TPP) (though she previously described it as [...] "the gold standard" [...] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that [...] "any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security". As Senator (2001â€“2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.|$|E
500|$|International {{trade and}} the {{negotiation}} of free-trade agreements were a priority in Key's third term. He has been a leading advocate of the <b>Trans-Pacific</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TPP), having also supported the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPSEP). Both agreements provide for a multilateral free-trade area in the Asiaâ€“Pacific region. In a September 2016 speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, Key said [...] " [...] will boost our economy by at least $2.7 billion a year by 2030. It will help diversify our economy and create more jobs and higher incomes for New Zealanders". Key was particularly intent on securing {{the participation of the}} United States in the agreement; to this end, he discussed TPP with President Barack Obama in April 2016, and hosted Secretary of State John Kerry in Wellington, 9â€“13 November 2016. The finalised TPP proposal was signed on 4 February 2016 in Auckland, concluding seven years of negotiations. The provisional proposal is currently awaiting ratification to enter into force. Ratification of the TPP agreement by the government will require approval from Parliament.|$|E
