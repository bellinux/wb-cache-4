5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|The series {{underwent}} further {{changes during}} {{the months leading up}} to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from The Girlie Show would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com. The idea was to air the fictitious TGS with Tracy Jordan online. <b>This</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series was abandoned prior to its debut.|$|E
5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. <b>This</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando Hunt in 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree the launching of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little and far too late.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> ``band-structure'' <b>of</b> a disordered stripe array is {{computed}} and compared, at {{a qualitative}} level, to angle resolved photoemission experiments on the cuprate high temperature superconductors. The low-energy states {{are found to}} be strongly localized transverse to the stripe direction, so the electron dynamics is strictly one-dimensional (along <b>the</b> stripe). Despite <b>this,</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two dimensional band-structure Fermi surface are still vividly apparent. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study of}} culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discipline Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
5|$|The Party Play mode was {{inspired}} by recognizing that past Guitar Hero games {{made it difficult to}} jump into without maneuvering through a number of menus and selection screens. The mode was designed to be used at social gatherings, and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers that players already had available, thus allowing for various other combinations beyond the standard four-person band. <b>This</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was then brought to the other band modes to allow the game to remain flexible.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{series is}} mainly {{based on the}} short stories and manga which preceded it. The anime focuses on Nagisa Aoi and, to a {{slightly}} lesser extent, Hikari Konohana, and the three girls that they each are or become close to at their respective schools; some admire them or wish to be their friend, and others are vying for their affections. Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in {{the election of the}} new Etoile pairing, although <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story is downplayed compared to the manga. Fan service, or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.|$|E

5|$|WASP-13 has a {{mass that}} is 1.03 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and a radius that is 1.34 times the Sun's radius. Measurements of its lithium content suggest that the star has used up all of its helium and is now fusing lithium in the shell around its core. With this, its {{estimated}} age is 8.5 billion years, over twice the age of the Sun, but this age may vary to any point between 4.4 and 14 billion years in age because of the high uncertainty surrounding <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star's age.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E
5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} plan, {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E

5|$|Making {{his debut}} with the Texas Rangers on June 20, 1991, {{he became the}} {{youngest}} player to catch in a major league game that season at 19 years of age. He immediately established himself as an excellent hitter who was also proficient in throwing out would-be base-stealers. No other catcher in the past 35years has been as successful at <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, with Rodríguez throwing out 48% of attempted basestealers through May 2006. He started many of the Rangers games {{at the end of}} the season, including 81 of the last 102. Rodríguez became the youngest player in the history of the Texas Rangers to hit a home run, on August 30, 1991, facing the Kansas City Royals and right-hander Storm Davis. He was named to the Major League Baseball (MLB) Rookie All-Star team by both Topps and Baseball America and finished in fourth place in the AL Rookie of the Year voting. He also placed first in throwing out runners, catching 48.6percent of runners attempting to steal.|$|E
5|$|When Suharto {{entered his}} seventh term as president, {{following}} an uncontested election on 10 March 1998, Indonesian students {{began a series}} of major demonstrations in protest of the New Order regime which continued for weeks and culminated in the shootings of four students by security forces at Trisakti University in May. The incident sparked major violence in several cities during 12–15 May. Property and businesses owned by Chinese Indonesians were targeted by mobs, and over 100 women were sexually assaulted; <b>this</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riots, though generally accepted as true, has been denied by several Indonesian groups. In the absence of security forces, large groups of men, women, and children looted and burned the numerous shopping malls in major cities. In Jakarta and Surakarta over 1,000 peopleboth Chinese and non-Chinesedied inside shopping malls. Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese fled the country following these events, and bankers estimated that US$20 billion of capital had left the country in 1997–1999 to overseas destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States.|$|E
