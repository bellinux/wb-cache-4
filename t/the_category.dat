40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} Fichte’s {{deduction of}} <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> in <b>the</b> Foundations {{of the entire}} Science of Knowledge (1794 / 95) {{from the perspective of}} Fichte’s view about the relation between his system and the Kantian philosophy concerning the question of <b>the</b> <b>categories.</b> It will be argued that Fichte modifies the Kantian table of <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> into a system of three categories groups, each of them composed by three categories. This implies, as it will be shown, the postulation of the reciprocal determination as first <b>category</b> and <b>the</b> exclusion from <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> system of both <b>the</b> modal <b>categories</b> and <b>the</b> distinction between dynamic and mathematical <b>categories.</b> <b>The</b> traditional interpretation of Fichte’s deduction of <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> is discussed...|$|R

Next, the Analytic of Principles sets out arguments for the relation of <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> to metaphysical principles.

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} once Kant has {{established}} his {{argument about the}} a priori transcendental ideality of Time, the objectivity of <b>the</b> <b>Categories</b> and their schematization can be established.

Further, once we understand the function of the Schematism and how Kant conceives of the Schemata, this will shed light as to the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Categories</b> themselves. Finally, I will propose an understanding of the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Categories</b> and Schemata that will make a transcendental {{solution to the problem of}} the objectivity of <b>the</b> <b>Categories</b> and Schemata possible...|$|R
