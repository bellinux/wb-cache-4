5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth.

After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations.

5|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the Moon's formation 4.51 billion years ago, and some 60 million years after {{the origin of the}} Solar System. These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force (which would require too great an initial spin of Earth), the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon (which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon), and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk (which does not explain <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> metals in the Moon).

5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals.

As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits.

40|$|The abundances of V, Cr, and Mn {{inferred}} for the mantles of {{the earth}} and moon decrease in that order and are similar in both mantles (but distinct from those in the mantles of the Eucrite Parent Body and Shergottite Parent Body), suggesting a common origin for the mantles {{of the earth}} and the moon. This hypothesis was investigated {{on the basis of a}} comparison between <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> <b>of</b> V, Cr, and Mn in the mantles {{of the earth and}} the moon, and the metal/silicate partition coefficients of these elements at 1260 C and 1 bar pressure among a S-bearing metallic liquid, a silicate melt, and a FeNi alloy. It was found that the earth and <b>the</b> moon <b>depletions</b> <b>of</b> V, Cr, and Mn are not correlated with metal/silicate partition coefficients; the V and Cr partitioned into S-rich metallic liquids under reducing conditions more strongly than Mn, consistent with the relative volatilities of these elements.

40|$|<b>Depletions</b> <b>of</b> {{volatile}} siderophile elements (VSE; Ga, Ge, In, As, Sb, Sn, Bi, Zn, Cu, Cd) in mantles of Earth and Moon, {{constrain the}} origin of volatile elements in these bodies, and <b>the</b> overall <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> volatile elements in Moon relative to Earth. A satisfactory explanation has remained elusive [1, 2]. We examine <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> <b>of</b> VSE in Earth and Moon and quantify <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>depletion</b> due to core formation and volatility of potential building blocks. We calculate {{the composition of the}} Earth's PUM during continuous accretion scenarios with constant and variable fO 2. Results suggest that the VSE can be explained by a rather simple scenario of continuous accretion leading to a high PT metal-silicate equilibrium scenario that establishes the siderophile element content of Earth's PUM near the end of accretion [3]. Core formation models for the Moon explain most VSE, but calculated contents of In, Sn, and Zn (all with Tc < 750 K) are all still too high after core formation, and must therefore require an additional process to explain <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> in <b>the</b> lunar mantle.

5|$|The {{division}} {{cut across}} the Elle River and advanced slowly toward Saint-Lô, fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedge rows. German reserves formed a new defensive front outside the town, and American forces fought a fierce battle with them two miles outside of the town. German forces used the dense bocage foliage to their advantage, mounting fierce resistance in house-to-house fighting in the ravaged Saint-Lô. By {{the end of the}} fight, the Germans were relying on artillery support to hold the town following <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> the infantry contingent. The 29th Division, which was already undermanned after heavy casualties on D-Day, was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint-Lô. Eventually, the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault, supported by airstrikes from P-47 Thunderbolts.|$|E
5|$|After withdrawing, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with Nürnberg and Titania at Nuku Hiva, {{where they}} resupplied and their crews took shore leave {{before moving on}} to meet the rest of the {{squadron}} at Easter Island. Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at Papeete and wreaked havoc in the town, they had been denied their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks. Von Spee's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive word on his position and heading, allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel. Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers. The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee's ships at Papeete were irreplaceable. <b>The</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> ammunition {{as a result of the}} action at Papeete contributed to the German East Asia Squadron's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers. Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of Papeete and for the loss of the gunboat Zélée. He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court-martialled, but died of illness in 1915 before the trial. In 1918, Destremau was finally recognized for his actions at Papeete and was posthumously awarded the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
