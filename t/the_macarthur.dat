5|$|The tunnel {{was first}} {{conceived}} in the 1980s {{as a way}} to remove traffic to PortMiami that was congesting downtown Miami streets. Prior to the tunnel's opening, the only route for PortMiami traffic was through the streets of downtown Miami; that traffic, especially trucks, was considered detrimental to the economic growth of downtown and a planned project to expand the port's capacity would increase the volume of trucks through downtown. Those issues would be remedied by the construction of the tunnel, allowing traffic to move between PortMiami and <b>the</b> <b>MacArthur</b> Causeway (which connects to Interstate 95 via I-395) without traveling through downtown. In the first month after opening, the tunnel averaged 7,000 vehicles per day; nearly 16,000 vehicles travel to the port each weekday.|$|E
