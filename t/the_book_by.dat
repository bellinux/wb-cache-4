5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. A chorale movement, {{which ends}} {{most of his}} cantatas originally conceived for church use, is here penultimate movement, followed by the only chorus. The first movements are for the soloists: recitatives, a duet and an aria. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbols for common time (4/4) and alla breve (2/2). The instruments are shown according to type (winds and strings), while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine {{documented}} their {{encounters with}} the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (淇淇) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (白鱀豚水族馆) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (石首半自然白鱀豚保护区), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Good <b>Book</b> Press {{was a fine}} {{press book}} publisher, founded in 1977 by Peter and Donna Thomas of Santa Cruz, California.

Peter Thomas (aka Peter Papermaker) made the paper and Donna Thomas illustrated <b>the</b> <b>books</b> predominately with linoleum cuts. The Thomases handset the type, letterpress printed <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> and bound <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>by</b> hand. Many of their works were sold at the California Renaissance Fair.|$|R

5|$|In New York, Sumner {{and several}} police detectives seized 865 copies of The Well from the publisher's offices, and Friede {{was charged with}} selling an obscene publication. But Covici and Friede had already moved the {{printing}} plates out of New York {{in order to continue}} publishing <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> <b>By</b> the time the case came to trial, it had already been reprinted six times. Despite its price of $5– twice the cost of an average novel– it sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E
5|$|Some of Speedys later {{exploits}} under Cochrane {{were used}} in the plot of the novel Master and Commander, part of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series, though the ship described by O'Brian matches only Speedy spar dimensions and armament, and is named HMS Sophie. Cochrane is replaced in <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> the fictional Jack Aubrey, who repeats many of Cochrane's real-life exploits including the defence of a convoy and the recapture of one of its merchants from a privateer, and the capture of a large Spanish frigate, based on the Gamo, but renamed Cacafuego for the novel.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{release was}} celebrated with a launch party at Los Angeles' Meltdown Comics which {{featured}} a public conversation with Vaughan's former colleague, Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof, who had hired Vaughan as a writer/producer on that series in 2007. Vaughan also promoted <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> appearing at signings at Midtown Comics in Manhattan and Bergen Street Comics in Brooklyn {{during the week}} of the first issue's release.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach {{is the fact that}} humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn {{more and more}} indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that {{the controversy}} broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E

5|$|After {{writing a}} {{television}} serial, Kashyap got his major break as a co-writer in Ram Gopal Varma's crime drama Satya (1998), {{and made his}} directorial debut with Paanch, which never had a theatrical release due to censorship issues. He {{then went on to}} direct Black Friday (2007), a film based on <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Hussain Zaidi about the 1993 Bombay bombings. Its release was held up for two years by the Central Board of Film Certification because of the pending verdict of the case at that time, but was released in 2007 to widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's followup, No Smoking (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture Dev.D (2009), a modern adaptation of Devdas was a critical and commercial success; followed by the political drama Gulaal (2009), and the thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011). His prominence increased with the two-part crime drama, Gangs of Wasseypur (2012). His next films were Bombay Talkies (2013), Ugly (2014) and Bombay Velvet (2015). In 2016, Kashyap directed Raman Raghav 2.0, a film based on the serial killer Raman Raghav.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
