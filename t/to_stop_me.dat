500|$|The {{recording}} {{session for}} [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] was {{conceived of as}} a side project for Jeff Beck {{while he was a}} member of the Yardbirds. [...] "It was decided that it would be a good idea for me to record some of my own stuff... partly <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> moaning about the Yardbirds", Beck recalled. [...] Also, the Yardbirds' management was encouraging individual band members to bring attention to the band through success in solo projects. Studio time was booked for May 1966 at the IBC Studios in London. [...] To prepare for the session, Beck called on long-time friend and studio guitarist Jimmy Page, who had recommended Beck as Eric Clapton's replacement in the Yardbirds, to work up some ideas for songs to record.|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me.</b> Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the return}} of Micky Adams as Port Vale manager, Tomlinson held on to his first team place {{at the start of}} the 2011–12 season, though Martin was used in cup games. Neither Tomlinson or Martin could find the {{consistency}} to secure their first team place though; Tomlinson conceded twelve goals in his first seven games of the season, whilst Martin conceded ten times in his first five games. Assistant manager Mark Grew told the media that [...] "they've both been disappointing". On 29 October, Tomlinson was embarrassed to be caught off his line by Oxford United's Peter Leven, who found the net with a 'sensational 45-yard strike'. Adams said [...] "...in the division, he's the only player who would have scored that... you have to question the keeper's starting position." [...] He was still preferred to Martin though, and only a thigh injury kept him out of two league games in January. He returned to the first team, and was heading for a third consecutive clean sheet on 14 February when he committed an [...] "injury-time howler" [...] to allow Bradford City a share of the points at Valley Parade. On 10 March he spilled a cross to hand Barnet striker Ben May an easy winner at Vale Park. He vowed to improve his consistency, saying [...] "I'm a pretty confident person and it will take a lot <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> bouncing back." [...] At the end of the season he rejected the club's offer of a new contract, and his departure was announced on 3 July. He said that he was [...] "not particularly worried" [...] about his free agent status, and that he would turn down similar offers from other clubs and wait until as late as the start of the following season until the [...] "right opportunity" [...] came about.|$|E

2500|$|Following Snowden's {{arrival in}} Moscow, the White House {{expressed}} disappointment in Hong Kong's {{decision to allow}} him to leave. An anonymous U.S. official not authorized to discuss the matter told AP Snowden's passport had been revoked before he left Hong Kong, but that a senior official in a country or airline could order subordinates to overlook the withdrawn passport. In a July 1 statement, Snowden said, [...] "Although I am convicted of nothing, [...] has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vang further {{testified that}} Joseph Crotteau {{deserved}} to die [...] "because he {{accused me of}} giving him the finger and tried to cut {{in front of me}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from leaving." [...] And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E

[...] After UFC {{president}} Dana White said Henderson had made the comment in jest, Henderson clarified by stating, [...] "When you're {{in the heat of}} the moment, the ref hadn't stopped me yet, who knows what's going to happen, if he's going to recover. I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't go after him after the ref tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me,</b> it was nothing like that. It was a reaction of mine to keep going until I was stopped—and you know, it did feel good though." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album gained media {{attention}} for its explicit themes and exploration of homosexuality, suggested as a [...] "queer-studies thesis." [...] Singapore law officials banned the album {{due to its}} lyrics supporting homosexuality. [...] "Free Xone" [...] speaks of gay, lesbian and bisexual pairings, as Jackson protests discrimination. [...] "Together Again" [...] recalls a departed friend lost to AIDS. Her cover of Rod Stewart's [...] "Tonight's the Night" [...] suggests losing her virginity to another woman, also alluding to bisexuality. Media attention led Stewart to announce [...] "that's an original song by Janet Jackson" [...] when performed in concerts. In response to criticism, Jackson said, [...] "I {{have a lot of}} gay friends, men and women, and that's why I did it. I knew people would say I was gay, and I didn't care." [...] She also stated, [...] "I caught a lot of hell for that... religious groups have been upset with me for certain songs on the album, but it’s not going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from writing what I feel inside." [...] Media reports of Jackson involved in intimate relationships with dancers Tina Landon and Shawnette Heard surfaced following its release, although denied.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1868, {{the pope}} was plagued first by facial {{erysipelas}} {{and then by}} open sores on his legs. Nevertheless, he insisted on celebrating daily Mass. The extraordinary heat of the summer of 1877 worsened the sores {{to the effect that}} he had to be carried. He underwent several painful medical procedures, which he undertook with remarkable patience. He spent most of his last few weeks in his library, where he received cardinals and held papal audiences. On 8 December, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, his situation improved markedly to the point that he could walk again. By February, he could say Mass again on his own in standing position, enjoying the popular celebration of the 75th anniversary of his first communion. Bronchitis, a fall to the floor, and rising temperature worsened his situation after 4 February 1878. He continued joking about himself: when the Cardinal Vicar of Rome ordered bell-ringing and non-stop prayers for his recuperation, the pope asked, [...] "Why do you want <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> from going to heaven?" [...] He told his doctor that his time had come. Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, aged 85, concluding the longest pontificate in papal history, after that of St. Peter, whom tradition holds had reigned for 37 years. His last words were, [...] "Guard the church I loved so well and sacredly", as recorded by the cardinals kneeling beside his bedside. His body was originally buried in St. Peter's grotto, but was moved in a night procession on 13 July 1881 to the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls. When the cortege approached the Tiber River, a group of anticlerical Romans screaming [...] "Long live Italy! Death to the Pope! Death to the Priests!" [...] threatened to throw the coffin into the river but a contingent of militia arrived to prevent this. The simple grave of Pius IX was changed by his successor, John Paul II, after his beatification.|$|E
