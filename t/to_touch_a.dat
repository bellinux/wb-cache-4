5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>a</b> scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E

They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by youth, a Jew was not allowed to fight them.

[...] Wilson continued, [...] "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>a</b> boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor." [...] Amanat added, As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.|$|E
