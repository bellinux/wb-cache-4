40|$|Abstract- The {{occurrence}} of dangerously {{high or low}} water levels at coastal locations is an important public concern and is {{a significant factor in}} coastal hazard assessment, navigational safety, and ecosystem management. The monthly highest and lowest water levels at 117 NOAA/National Ocean Service water level stations show a clear response to local mean sea level trends. The extreme levels reached by hurricanes and extra-tropical storms of the past can be adjusted for sea level trend, so that unbiased comparisons can be made. A data set of the annual highest and lowest water levels is derived from the monthly data and used to determine the expected frequency of future storm tides rising above or falling below any given level. The same analysis is also applied to the data for each individual month in order to estimate the varying likelihood of extreme high or low levels by season. The results are a set of annual and monthly exceedance probability levels relative to the <b>tidal</b> <b>datums</b> for each station. This information should prove useful for identifying, in real time, when a rare event threshold has been crossed.

50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{measuring}} the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a <b>tidal</b> <b>datum</b> which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects {{of the sun and}} the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921).

To assess potential inundation associated with a continued acceleration of sea level rise, the highest resolution elevation data available were assembled from various sources and mosaicked to cover the land surfaces of the San Francisco Bay region. Next, to quantify extreme water levels throughout the bay, a hydrodynamic model of the San Francisco Estuary was driven by a projection of hourly water levels at the Presidio. This projection was based on a combination of climate model outputs, an empirical model, and observations, and incorporates astronomical, storm surge, El Niño, and long-term sea level rise influences. Based on the resulting data, maps of areas vulnerable to inundation were produced, corresponding to specific amounts of sea level rise and recurrence intervals, including <b>tidal</b> <b>datums.</b> These maps portray areas where inundation will likely be an increasing concern. In the North Bay, wetlands and some developed fill areas are at risk. In Central and South bays, a key feature is the landward periphery of developed areas that would be newly vulnerable to inundation. Nearly all municipalities adjacent to South Bay face this risk to some degree. For the bay as a whole, as early as mid-century under this scenario, the one-year peak event nearly equals the 100 -year peak event in 2000.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Throughout the Holocene, appreciable {{changes in}} {{bathymetry}} are hypothesized to {{have resulted in}} large changes to <b>tidal</b> <b>datums</b> in coastal and estuarine areas. An understanding of tidal change is {{an important contribution to}} the knowledge of relative historical sea-level change and future coastal planning. To test this hypothesis, the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model was used, with representative bathymetric grids based on glacial isostatic adjustment models and semi-empirical sea level rise predictions, in order to model the time-varying tidal behavior of the Delaware Bay. Model runs were conducted at various time slices between 10, 000 years before present and 300 years into the future on high resolution grids that allowed for inundation moving forward in time. Open boundary tidal forcing was held constant in time to highlight the effect of the changing regional bathymetry. With each change in sea level, the shape of the Delaware Bay was considerably altered, leading to changes in the tides. Resonance and shallow water dissipation appeared to be the primary mechanisms behind these changes. Results showed that tidal ranges have nearly doubled in the upper Delaware Bay over the past 3000 years, while decreasing in the lower bay by 8 %. Tidal range change represents a possible correction to past sea level rise estimates from the geologic record. Scenarios incorporating future sea level predictions primarily showed a small decrease in tidal range, potentially impacting future water levels and tidal sediment transport.

40|$|The tidal {{interface}} or {{inter-tidal zone}} {{is that part}} of the coastal zone that falls between the extremes of Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT) and Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT). It is an area of considerable interest and diverse human activity. The tidal interface possesses significant economic and commercial value {{while at the same time}} being a sensitive and delicately balanced environment. A number of competing and sometimes complementary rights, restrictions and responsibilities from private, public and commercial interests interact in the inter-tidal zone. The administration and governance of these interests in an equitable and sustainable manner is a complex and challenging task. Virtually all activities in the tidal interface are spatially governed. More often than not, the defining boundaries relate to the line of intersection between a particular <b>tidal</b> <b>datum</b> and the land mass. For example, in Australia, freehold titles to coastal land parcels are limited in their seaward extent by the line of Mean High Water.

This work demonstrates the prediction of hydrodynamics and biomass density of salt marsh to provide useful information for the planning and mitigation of sea-level rise impacts on marsh sustainability in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR), Florida. An advanced circulation code was applied to simulate hydrodynamics (i. e., shallow water equations) in the GTMNERR. The model used a set of parameters and conditions based on the GTMNERR domain to predict tides for present-day conditions, which was validated using tidal data from eight monitoring stations within the GTMNERR. The hydrodynamic model results (i. e., MLW and MHW) were then coupled with a marsh equilibrium model to assess year-to-year biomass density for saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Vegetative data {{were obtained from the}} staff of the GTMNERR and organized for future work towards validation of biomass density predictions.

The Texas A&M University Corpus Christi Division of Nearshore Research (TAMUCC-DNR) has developed and compared various methods based on forward and backward linear regression to interpolate gaps in time series of water level data. We have developed a software system that retrieves actual and harmonic water level data based upon user provided parameters. The actual water level data is searched for missing data points {{and the location of}} these gaps are recorded. Forward and backward linear regression are applied in relation to the location of missing data or gaps in the remaining data. After this process is complete, one of three combinations of the forward and backward regression is used to fit the results. Finally, the harmonic component is added back into the newly supplemented time series and the results are graphed. The software created to implement this process of linear regression is written in Perl along with a Perl module called PDL (Perl Data Language). Generally, this process has demonstrated excellent results in filling gaps in our water level time series. The program was tested on existing data under three typesof typical weather conditions: calm summers, frontal passages and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes. The parameters varied in order to test the accuracy of the methodology included the number of coefficients utilized in the linear regression processes as well as the size of the gaps to be filled. Results are presented for the different weather conditions and the different gap size and coefficient combinations...|$|R
