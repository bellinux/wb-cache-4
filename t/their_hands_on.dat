5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on,</b> at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, the Jewel House was {{demolished}} and the Crown Jewels {{moved into}} Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public. This was exploited {{two years later}} when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.|$|E

5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit {{had not yet}} fallen on them. The Samaritans received the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> them. The Apostle Paul was also filled with the Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{beginning}} principal photography, Refn {{went to the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film. In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager to get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, {{as well as the}} arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E

25|$|Being {{tough on}} terrorism, {{particularly}} {{the sorts of}} homegrown terrorism that we've seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means {{making it harder for}} people who want to kill Americans to get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible. That's something I'll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.|$|E
25|$|On {{successive}} possessions in {{the second}} quarter, Harrell led quick-hitting drives of 53-, 70-, and 54-yards. Freeman, however, misfired on 9 of 10 passes, several of which Tech defenders got <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> The Kansas State junior, who a week earlier had become his own school’s career passing leader, was 13-for-28 for 170 yards.

5000|$|To {{conceal the}} {{strength}} of a player's hand: If a player has a very strong hand, they might smooth call on an early betting round to avoid giving away {{the strength of}} <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the hope of getting more money into the pot in later betting rounds.|$|R
25|$|While {{attempting}} to make a living, they began to experiment with tape machines, photography, and anything remotely to do with art {{that they could get}} <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> Word of their experimentation spread and in 1969, a British guitarist and multi-instrumentalist named Phil Lithman and the mysterious (and perhaps apocryphal) N. Senada (whom Lithman had picked up in Bavaria where the aged avant-gardist was recording birds singing) paid them a visit, and decided to remain.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Kashgar (1933) {{the city}} changed hands {{multiple}} times as the confused factions battled each other. The Kirghiz began to murder any Han Chinese and Chinese Muslim {{they could get}} <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on,</b> and fighting {{broke out in the}} streets. Timur Beg became sympathetic to the pro-independence rebels of Muhammad Amin Bughra and Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki, while Ma Zhancang proclaimed his allegiance to the Chinese Kuomintang government and notified everyone that all former Chinese officials would keep their posts.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} held at Vendôme {{beginning}} on 20 February 1797. Although more important people {{were involved in the}} conspiracy, the government depicted Babeuf as the leader. His own vanity played into <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>On</b> Prairial 7 (26 May 1797) Babeuf and Darthé were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including Buonarroti, were deported; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow-conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet managed to escape, according to Paul Barras, with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf and Darthé were guillotined the next day at Vendôme, Prairial 8 (27 May 1797), without appeal.|$|E
50|$|When {{a player}} has {{gotten rid of}} all of their cards, they win the hand. There are two variations. Either the player must discard the last {{remaining}} card in <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the last turn, or they need not. Playing with this rule makes ending a hand slightly more difficult.|$|R
50|$|When {{fighting}} in extended order the Regimental Colour became exposed and were therefore discarded, the Rifleman being taught that his rifle took {{the place of}} Colours to be guarded with his life.

50|$|A typical {{envenomation}} incident {{involves a}} person unknowingly leaning against, placing <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on,</b> or rubbing <b>their</b> arm against {{a group of}} these caterpillars that are gathered on {{the trunk of a}} tree.

The resulting medical syndrome is sometimes called Lonomiasis.|$|R
25|$|Toulon {{remained}} {{one of the}} top French clubs, {{but they}} lost four consecutive finals scattered over 35 years (1948, 1968, 1971 and 1985). The 1985 extra-time defeat by Stade Toulousain left them with a lot of regrets, and playing in the most spectacular final ever (36–22) did nothing to alleviate the pain of losing. The Red and Black only waited two more years to finally lay <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Bouclier de Brennus, as they defeated Racing at the Parc des Princes. The third title came in 1992, against Biarritz Olympique, in Serge Blanco's last match and last chance to win the title.|$|E
25|$|Under Edward VI, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{sponsored}} an act allowing Newcastle to annexe Gateshead as its suburb. The {{main reason}} for this was to allow the Newcastle Hostmen, who controlled the export of Tyne coal, to get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Gateshead coal mines, previously controlled by the Bishop of Durham. However, when Mary I came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories {{and as a result}} coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.|$|E
25|$|After being {{approved}} {{for participation in}} the J. League S-Pulse competed in the inaugural 1992 J. League Cup and made it to their first final. However, the dream start ended with defeat at the hands of Verdy Kawasaki. In 1993, S-Pulse became one of the ten founder members of the new J. League, and finished third after the 1st and 2nd stages were combined. Their second venture into the J. League Cup was another near miss, again losing in the final to Verdy Kawasaki. Finally, in 1996 the team got <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the trophy and also gained revenge on Verdy, beating them 5–4 on penalties in the final.|$|E
