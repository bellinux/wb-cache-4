5|$|Maryland (ACC: 4–2) {{would have}} won the {{division}} title if they had either: (1) beaten both Florida State and Boston College; (2) beaten Florida State, while Boston College lost <b>to</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest; or (3) beaten Boston College, while Boston College lost <b>to</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest. That last scenario would have caused a three-way tie between Maryland, Florida State, and Wake Forest. All would have possessed a 5–3 conference record, and no head-to-head tiebreaker would have been possible. In that case, the winner would have been decided by divisional record, of which the Terrapins {{would have had the}} best (ACC Atlantic: 4–1).|$|E

5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit.

The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E

She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E

5|$|Bobby Ross {{came from}} Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years.

Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech's program. The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman.

They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous.

The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too.

5|$|Following the {{identification}} of a tropical disturbance on November6, a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness (TCOR), {{the lowest level of}} alert, was raised for Guam. By November8, three days prior to Karen's arrival, this was raised to level three, prompting residents and military personnel to stock up on supplies. A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised to level one, the highest level of warning. At this time, the USS Haverfield, USS Brister, USS Wandank, and USS Banner sought refuge from the storm over open waters. All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage.
