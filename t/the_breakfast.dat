5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas {{is placed in the}} Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau. A popular food item, <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and {{scrambled}} eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{structure}} {{influenced the}} biographical films Lawrence of Arabia and —which {{begin with the}} subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin. Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, {{as well as the}} theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with Citizen Kane and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table montage in Citizen Kane.|$|E
5|$|The score {{established}} Herrmann as {{an important}} new composer of film soundtracks and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. <b>The</b> <b>breakfast</b> montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as {{the passage of time}} leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.|$|E

In 1980 or 1981 she left Breakfast Club and, with her former boyfriend Stephen Bray as drummer, formed the band Emmy. The two began writing songs together, but Madonna later decided to market herself as a solo act. Her music impressed DJ and record producer Mark Kamins who arranged a meeting between Madonna and Sire Records founder Seymour Stein.|$|E
5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. <b>The</b> <b>breakfast</b> menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E

50|$|The strand also {{acted as}} an {{umbrella}} brand for the programming which it linked to, {{by use of}} Big Breakfast style break-bumpers and Digital On-Screen Graphics. The expanded format always featured the regular content of <b>The</b> Big <b>Breakfast</b> from 7am-9am. <b>The</b> first run of <b>The</b> Bigger <b>Breakfast</b> during <b>the</b> summer of 1997 was titled as such {{all the way from}} its 7am start, presented throughout by Richard Orford and Denise Van Outen. Future editions would see slight separations made from the 7am-9am content, by way of this portion of the show being branded and scheduled as <b>The</b> Big <b>Breakfast,</b> with all content after 9am taking on <b>the</b> expanded Bigger <b>Breakfast</b> name. After a while, a further distinction was made by using a different set of presenters from that of <b>The</b> Big <b>Breakfast.</b> Presenters of <b>The</b> Bigger <b>Breakfast</b> included Josie D'Arby, Ben Shephard, Melanie Sykes and Dermot O'Leary.|$|R

5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day.

These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E

5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E

Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in {{the final quarter}} of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year.

5|$|In September 2011, Simon Bates {{presented}} {{a week of}} programmes from South Australia {{as part of a}} promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E

5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E
