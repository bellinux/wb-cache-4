5|$|The episode's finale is Don's day and {{the trip}} to Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh. As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} at having her needs and desires <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the {{other side of the}} conversation from {{the first part of the}} episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E
500|$|The video {{garnered}} media attention, with Monica Herrera of Billboard {{commenting on}} a review for the single, [...] "It figures, then, that discussion of her debut single, [...] "Massive Attack," [...] would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to its Hype Williams-directed, B-movie-inspired video." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV News {{commented on the}} video, saying, [...] "We L-U-V Barbie because she's a trendsetter and a strident, unique artist. But with great style comes great responsibility. Her video for 'Massive Attack,' the first single off her long-awaited debut album, is bananas".|$|E

500|$|Browner found {{criticism}} {{from both sides}} of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods. [...] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however. A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.

500|$|The {{music video}} premiered on October 9, 2009 on CMT. Peter Gicas of E! thought the video was [...] "sweet" [...] and said, [...] "And while the visuals here—Taylor walking {{in and out}} of various {{animated}} scenes—are certainly nice to look at, they nevertheless <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to the country star's cuteness." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly graded the video a B. Greenblatt believed the video was reverential and painterly, but criticized it by saying [...] "Fifteen"'s most powerful lyrics were outdone by the dreamy design. Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, [...] "Taylor Swift is 'Fifteen' all over again in the new music video for her song of the same name." [...] At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video, but lost to Lady Gaga's video for [...] "Bad Romance" [...] (2009).|$|E
500|$|However, the {{workings}} of the plot remain elusive to most. Sharp digressed, [...] "o be honest it isn't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably take a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge." [...] As Zorn has put it, [...] "plot and narrative devices <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images." [...] Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, [...] "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [...] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." [...] David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, [...] "f you consider the movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, [...] "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this." ...|$|E

Smylie, {{author of the}} article entitled [...] "Why I Feel Sorry for Lurleen Wallace." [...] In his memoirs, Wallace recounts his wife's ability to [...] "charm crowds" [...] and cast off invective: [...] "I was immensely proud of her, and it didn't hurt a bit to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to her in vote-getting ability." [...] Wallace rebuffed critics who claimed that he had [...] "dragooned" [...] his wife into the race.

2500|$|AllMusic's Jonathan Lewis {{compared}} Love This City {{to their}} previous album, [...] "this disc is less cohesive, covering {{a wide range}} of subject matter. The song style is different here, too, as Freedman allows his piano to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to guitars or brass on a number of tracks. The city of the title is Sydney, and many of these songs relate to its changing face." [...] He described [...] "You Gotta Love This City" [...] as [...] "less-than-complimentary reaction to the commercialism of the Olympic Games" [...] and [...] "Blow Up the Pokies" [...] as detailing the [...] "infiltration of gambling machines into suburban bars and clubs." [...] Nimmervoll described how the album [...] "was again recorded in a number of studios, with a changed line-up, leaning on the same and new songwriting collaborations. It couldn't match the emotional charge that came with Eternal Nightcap but did enough to ensure The Whitlams' survival." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, players cannot select {{members of}} their own team. In essence, the players must look to the other teams in their conference and {{honestly}} select those that they trust in a pivotal game. Rather than a popularity contest or the staleness of players selecting only their own, LCBL voters must put some thought into the ballot. Receiving a peer vote is the ultimate sign of respect; a non-teammate selection recognizes a rival's talent enough to count on him to win the game. [...] And that is where the voting format forces competitors to unify for a common purpose: team allegiances <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to that of the conference. Players get tired of hearing that the weekend (or the weekday) is where the best talent in the league plays. The All-Star Game is the pinnacle bragging rights game, allowing players to settle it on the field. The winning conference sends a representative to the home dugout for the Discovery Cup Championship a month later.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to these major works Caird provided a number of shorter studies on numerous topics: Septuagintal lexicography (e.g. [...] "Towards a Lexicon of the Septuagint," [...] 1969); the Christian's attitude to war (War and the Christian, 1979; Caird was a lifelong but undemonstrating pacifist) and Apartheid (South Africa: Reflections on a Visit, 1976). Toward {{the end of his}} career he was commissioned to write a number of books, including the New International Critical Commentary on The Epistle to the Hebrews and the volume on Paul in OUP's Past Masters series. But these were to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to his New Testament Theology, intended to be the ultimate statement of his thinking on the New Testament, and on which he had been working for some years. While he did not live to see it finished, it was edited and completed by Lincoln Hurst and published posthumously by the OUP in 1994 (hardback) and 1995 (paperback).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the magical}} realist writers, the McOndos wrote [...] "here-and-now!" [...] fiction, about the 21st-century world they inhabit, and which {{surrounds}} them, and the homogenizing cultural-identity messages of pervasive mass communications media; to be Latin in an Anglo culture. Because contemporary Latin America {{is a cultural}} conflation of the 19th and 21st centuries, the McOndos substantive and technical divergence from Magical Realism (style, narrative mode, etc.) voided their predecessor traditions. Alberto Fuguet explains, [...] "I feel [...] the great literary theme of ‘Latin American identity’ (who are we?) must now <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> {{to the theme of}} ‘personal identity’ (who am I?)." [...] Whilst rejecting the resultant stereotype [...] "Latin American Literature" [...] derived from Magical Realism, the McOndos nonetheless respect the man; [...] "I’m a really big fan of Márquez, but, what I really hate is the software he created, that other people use [...] [...] [...] they turn [...] into more of an aesthetic [...] instead of an ideology. Anybody who begins to copy One Hundred Years of Solitude turns it into kitsch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to The Sun {{newspaper}} in June 2008, Swash {{has talked about}} his dissatisfaction with the direction the producers had taken Mickey. In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for [...] "light relief" [...] since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three-month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis — a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be [...] "frantically reworking scripts" [...] to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating {{on the relationship between}} Mickey and his estranged father Mike had to be cut. He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. When I came back I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch yourself. To be fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff. I was over the moon about the family but producers needed to concentrate on developing their characters and I had to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> [...] Mickey just became light relief – the joker. That’s all right but I’ve got more ambition. I would have stayed for ages if I had good stuff, but I wasn’t getting the work [...] I wasn't that upset when I was told [...] I kind of predicted it [...] My character hadn’t been working out for ages [...] it will be a relief not to be Mickey Miller any more!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] a {{four out}} of five rating. He felt that when N-Dubz teamed up with Bodyrox for their soundtrack {{contribution}} to StreetDance 3D, they clearly took on board what the film was all about: overcoming prejudices and, the merging of diverse styles of music and dance. Copsey said, [...] "Much like the film itself, 'We Dance On' features an assortment of different influences that might seem contradictory on paper, but inevitably work out for the best in the end." [...] He noted that the verses about pursuing your dreams like a [...] "fox on a mission" [...] and [...] "the big, Bob Marley-inspired chorus – [...] "I know everything's gonna be alright/Now you're standing here by my side" [...] will surely tug at the heartstrings of the song's listener. Copsey {{went on to say that}} the track [...] "leaves you feeling warm, fuzzy and [...] better inside." [...] BBCs Fraser McAlpine felt that [...] "We Dance On" [...] was capable of bringing its listener to tears with, [...] "massive churning string section" [...] from Johann Pachelbel's [...] "Canon in D Major" [...] and few [...] "everything's gonna be alright" [...] chants. McAlpine noted that the string section contains influences from The Farm's [...] "All Together Now" [...] (1990). He went on to interpret the song's chants as being inspired by Bob Marley's [...] "No Woman, No Cry" [...] (1974). Gavin Martin of the Daily Mirror gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] three out of five stars in his review of the single. He highlighted Tulisa Contostavlos' contribution in the song, saying: [...] "Often forced to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> while her male counterparts lead, N-Dubz' front lady Tulisa comes out front for this". Martin went on to describe the song as a [...] "crowd-pleasing and unifying floor filler with a hint of classical spice." ...|$|E
