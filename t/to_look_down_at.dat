25|$|The {{head-up display}} projects, through a combiner, all {{essential}} flight information {{gathered by the}} integrated avionics system. This display, visible in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> cockpit instruments.|$|E
25|$|The yaw string, {{also known}} as a slip string, is a simple device for {{indicating}} a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight. It performs the same function as the slip-skid indicator ball, but is more sensitive, and does not require the pilot <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the instrument panel. Technically, it measures sideslip angle, not yaw angle, but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the sideslip angle to zero.|$|E
60|$|Doctor Prince nodded, but he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the pools of blood and the bar of iron.|$|E
60|$|He gazed rather arrogantly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me. It always irritated me <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> that way.|$|R
60|$|He {{put on his}} fur-coat {{and opened}} the door, but Hetty's heart throbbed again when he stopped a moment. As it happened, the fire was {{flashing}} brilliantly, and the corporal appeared <b>to</b> be <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the footprints by the threshold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, one oughtn't to wish any man {{worse than}} he's likely to get. But when I see people daring <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> their noses <b>at</b> you--by Jove! I get--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Another pause, {{during which}} Maggie looked {{steadily}} {{out of the}} window, till by a great effort she moved her head <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Minny's back again, and said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|He said nothing, but {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with a}} dreamy gentleness, and Tessa felt herself {{in a state of}} delicious wonder; everything seemed as new as if she were being earned on a chariot of clouds.|$|E
60|$|The sentry {{stood by}} and {{allowed them to}} pass, {{although}} he looked searchingly at Granet. They walked slowly up the scrubby avenue to the house. Once Granet paused <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the long arm of the sea on his left.|$|E
60|$|I {{had given}} him no time to speak, nor did he seem so inclined. He Continued looking {{at me for a}} moment with an air of {{whimsical}} perplexity; scanned me from head <b>to</b> foot; <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the manuscript, then up again at me, then pointed to a chair; and whistling softly to himself, went on writing his letter.|$|R
60|$|Instantly Jenny Wren popped {{her head}} out of her doorway. She cocked her head on one side <b>to</b> listen, then <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Peter, and her sharp little eyes snapped.|$|R
60|$|Suzette, on {{whom she}} felt a {{thoroughly}} justified tendency <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down,</b> had <b>at</b> any rate an attentive and considerate lover. Elaine walked towards the Park gates feeling that in one essential Suzette possessed something that had been denied to her, and at the gates she met Joyeuse and his spruce young rider preparing to turn homeward.|$|R
60|$|He had sauntered far enough. Before {{turning to}} retrace his steps, he stopped upon the margin, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{reflected}} night. In an instant, with a dreadful crash, the reflected night turned crooked, flames shot jaggedly across the air, {{and the moon}} and stars came bursting from the sky.|$|E
60|$|Poor Adele, who {{had been}} famed for {{neatness}} even among housekeepers of the Rue St. Martin, hardly dared <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her own stained and tattered dress. Fatigue and danger she had endured with a smiling face, but her patience almost gave way {{at the thought of}} facing strangers in this attire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{turning out}} a terrible tea toper," [...] said Colville, {{stirring}} his cup {{in front of}} the old lady whom his relations to the ladies at Palazzo Pinti had interested so much. [...] "I don't think I drink less than ten cups a day; seventy cups a week is a low average for me. I'm really beginning <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my boots a little anxiously." ...|$|E
6000|$|ST. HERBERT [He comes <b>to</b> him, stands <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him.] Did {{it never}} occur to you, {{when you were}} advocating equal {{political}} rights for women, that awkward situations might arise? ...|$|R
60|$|By and by, Tommy Tit stopped <b>to</b> rest. He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Miss Fuzzytail {{and winked}} a saucy black eye. Miss Fuzzytail winked back. Then both laughed, {{for they were}} very good friends, indeed.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Hsiao-kang is {{smoking in}} a public toilet stall. After he finishes, he washes his hands and leaves the restroom. He then walks up some stairs on the underpass. Shiang-chyi is walking down the same flight of stairs, and they pass each other. Hsiao-kang pauses {{at the top of}} the {{staircase}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, but Shiang-chyi does not notice him.|$|R
6000|$|Dominic went forward. He paused <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Cesar, who, as I {{have said}} before, was lying full length face {{down by the}} foremast, then stepped over him, and dived {{out of my sight}} under the foresail. I saw nothing ahead. It was {{impossible}} for me to see anything except the foresail open and still, like a great shadowy wing. But Dominic had his bearings. His voice came to me from forward, in a just audible cry: ...|$|E
60|$|He knew it {{was late}} when he woke. The boat was at rest, and must be lying at her landing in Quebec. He heard the {{passengers}} outside hurrying down the cabin to go ashore. When he had collected himself, and recalled {{the events of the}} night, he was almost afraid <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Northwick lest he should find him lying dead in his berth; when he summoned courage to look, he found the berth empty.|$|E
60|$|This remark {{sent the}} Scot into a rather learned disquisition {{as to the}} merits and {{probable}} prospects of a hill as compared with a low-lying region, during which Hans Marais turned to Gertie. Being so very tall, he had to stoop as well as <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her pretty face, though Gertie {{was by no means}} short for her age. Indeed, she was as tall as average women, but, being only twelve, was slender and girlish.|$|E
60|$|To {{those at}} the bottom of the social pyramid, however, who stand with their feet upon the earth, Nature is not a curious {{phenomenon}} <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> and studied, but a living force to be obeyed. They front grim, naked Life, face to face, and wrestle with it through the darkness; and, as did the angel that strove with Jacob, it leaves its stamp upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} had so {{pleasant}} a greeting,' said Clennam--then he recalled what Little Dorrit had said to him in his own room, and faithfully added 'except once--since we last walked <b>to</b> and fro, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Mediterranean.' ...|$|R
60|$|Vivienne LeMar went on singing, {{drifting}} {{from one}} sweet love song into another. Once {{she looked up}} at Spencer Morgan. He rose quickly and went <b>to</b> her side, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her with a strange fire in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{walked up}} the Rue des Sts. Peres, enjoying the delicious air. Half way across the bridge she overtook a man, strolling listlessly in front of her. There was {{something}} familiar about him. He was wearing a grey suit and had {{his hands in his}} pockets. Suddenly the truth flashed upon her. She stopped. If he strolled on, {{she would be able to}} slip back. Instead of which he abruptly turned <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a passing steamer, and they were face to face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I not owe {{something}} to myself?" [...] said Tito, inwardly, {{with a slight}} movement of his shoulders, the first he had made since he had turned <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the florins. [...] "Before I quit everything, and incur again all the risks of which I am even now weary, I must {{at least have a}} reasonable hope. Am I to spend my life in a wandering search? I believe he is dead. Cennini was right about my florins: I will place them in his hands to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|Charnock got up {{and went}} off, beating his hands. He noted that there was a hole in the mittens he had brought from home. This was {{annoying}} because Sadie had given him the mittens. In spite of many difficulties, they braced the posts securely before they stopped work, and when supper was over Charnock reluctantly put on his coat. He wanted to ask Norton something, and when he left the latter's office came back along a narrow path above the track. After going a short distance he stopped <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the half-finished frames.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} hand {{she held out}} <b>to</b> him, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her out of his grimy, {{disfigured}} face, an odd tenderness stirring him. He felt as might have felt a father towards his daughter--at least, so thought he then.|$|R
6000|$|Something in his {{resolute}} tone made Jo <b>look</b> {{up quickly}} <b>to</b> find him <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with an}} expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, [...] "No, Teddy. Please don't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|A shadow {{fell across}} them, and Burnamy glanced round <b>to</b> see Stoller <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them, with a slant {{of the face}} that brought his aquiline profile into relief. [...] "Oh! Have a turf, Mr. Stoller?" [...] he called gayly up to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}}," [...] said Brown, turning for {{a moment}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the sea, which now lay spread out far below them like a blue plain, [...] "I've been thinking that the proof of people having been here long ago lies not only in these stones, axes, spears, and images, {{but also in the}} fact that we find the cocoa-nut trees, bananas, plantains, breadfruit-trees, as well as yams and sweet potatoes, grow chiefly in the sunny and sheltered parts of the island, and gathered together {{as if they had been}} planted there." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{while she}} was eating she chanced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her feet, {{and there was a}} great black spider coming {{straight}} towards her. The girl had never seen such an enormous and hideous-looking spider before, and she was so frightened that she gave a scream and tipped backward off the tuffet, spilling the curds and whey all over her dress as she did so. This frightened her more than ever, and as soon as she could get upon her feet she scampered away to the farmhouse as fast as she could go, crying bitterly as she ran.|$|E
6000|$|The Emperor {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the kneeling boy, {{and at last}} he gave a short, dry laugh. [...] "So be it," [...] said he, [...] "thy plan is {{not without}} its wisdom. Mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be ended thus peacefully. The estates of the Roderburgs shall be held in trust for thee until thou art come of age; otherwise it shall be as thou hast proposed, the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own care. And as to thee--art thou willing that I should take thee under my own charge in the room of thy father, who is dead?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Drosera: Drosera is Sariac's wife. She likes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> {{her nose}} <b>at</b> other people. She thinks Pitt {{is a threat}} to the tribe and thinks he could {{overturn}} her world (although she did thank Pitt for saving her life in The Big Wheel).|$|R
50|$|The artworks in the {{painting}} are set alongside the actions of high-society criticism. The young man offering {{his hand to the}} woman in pink is set against a series of female nudes, while puritanical figures in portraits at the left seem <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> disapprovingly. <b>At</b> the right, there are numerous images of orgies and naked figures, implying that art expresses the hidden lustful feelings of the genteel figures in the shop, who merely gaze at one another or engage in polite gestures of intimacy.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} the Long Beach Pier, looking {{towards the}} shore {{from the end of the}} pier, ca. 1903. A large group of people is {{gathered}} near the edge of the pier at center. They appear <b>to</b> be <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> two small sailboats tied alongside the wharf. A raised platform is at left, and more men are <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> from there. A building with three small towers is visible on the shore in the distance, and several other buildings can be seen in the background at right...|$|R
