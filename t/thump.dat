5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky <b>Thump,</b> and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing {{at the conclusion of the}} concert. The film was {{directed by}} a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy. A second feature, titled Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} <b>thump</b> outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen {{what appeared to be a}} red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E

60|$|It was {{impossible}} to combine {{the image of a}} lean black widow, gazing out of her window, and longing for some one to talk to, with the image of a vast machine, such as one sees at South Kensington, <b>thumping,</b> <b>thumping,</b> <b>thumping.</b> The attempt at communication had been a failure.|$|R
25|$|The {{precordial}} <b>thump</b> is a manoeuver {{promoted as}} a mechanical alternative to defibrillation.

25|$|The {{third week}} of August saw Sussex <b>thump</b> Middlesex inside two days, beating them by an innings and 232 runs - the highest margin of victory in the entire season - to {{temporarily}} go top of Division One, only 18 days after they had been precariously positioned in the relegation zone. However, the week ended with another loss to Leicestershire in the National League, which meant that Leicestershire also involved themselves in the title battle in Division Two. Three days later, Sussex beat Warwickshire in the same competition, mainly thanks to figures of 6-27 from Michael Yardy. In the County Championship, however, they lost to Warwickshire, before finishing August with two National League victories over Scotland and Surrey.|$|E
25|$|The Scots {{went into}} this tournament as favourites, being holders of the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht {{prevented}} them from a good start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to have them all out for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed to <b>thump</b> Ireland in Aberdeen {{if they were to}} have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.|$|E

25|$|Murphy {{opened the}} 2013 season on 2 February with nine points against Kildare {{in the opening}} league game at Croke Park. Analysts praised the skills he {{displayed}} throughout that game; {{at one point in}} the second half he stretched high into the air to meet a miscalculated free from Paddy McBrearty and gave it an almighty <b>thump</b> with his fist over the bar, while on another occasion he left the Kildare defender stumbling along the ground as he sidestepped him and casually at an angle from distance, with the appearance of little effort whatsoever, kicked the ball over the bar. Against Tyrone on 3 March, he scored 3 from 4 of Donegal's points and then, shortly before half-time, having had a penalty saved by TG4 Man of the Match Niall Morgan, Murphy struck out and was issued with a second yellow card by Joe McQuillan. Against Kerry on 10 March, man of the match Murphy dispatched a penalty and five points in Donegal's comfortable victory over the league's whipping boys.|$|E
25|$|Geoff Pullar (56) and David Sheppard (53) added 114 for {{the first}}-wicket in 147 minutes, {{the first century}} opening stand for England in Australia since 1946-47. But they batted slowly and the left-handed Lancastrian never settled down properly. He edged a {{boundary}} through the slips, nearly chopped McKenzie onto his stumps and was dropped by Jarman. In the end Alan Davidson (3/43) slowed down his pace and had him caught and bowled after lunch. This brought Ted Dexter striding to the crease {{and he began to}} <b>thump</b> the ball off the boundary fence to take England to 182/2 by tea. Colin Cowdrey (9) was caught-and-bowled by Benaud (1/71) after the break, but Dexter and Ken Barrington hit 66 runs in 86 minutes to keep the game going. They were both out on 257, Dexter yorked by McKenzie (2/61) after a magnificent 99 - few doubted that he deserved a century - and Barrington caught off Davidson for 23. This ended any chance of England winning the game - they now needed 121 runs in 40 minutes - and the Australian fielders crowded around the wicket, but there was no miracle in store for them either. Peter Parfitt was caught by Jarman off McKenzie, but Fred Titmus and Barry Knight batted out the last half hour and they finished on 278/6.|$|E
500|$|The band then {{released}} their fifth studio album Get Behind Me Satan in June 2005.

60|$|Little Toomai {{attended}} to Kala Nag's supper, and as evening fell, {{wandered through the}} camp, unspeakably happy, {{in search of a}} tom-tom. When an Indian child's heart is full, he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular fashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he had not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. But the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten with the flat of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he <b>thumped</b> and he <b>thumped</b> and he <b>thumped,</b> and the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him, the more he <b>thumped,</b> all alone among the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the <b>thumping</b> made him happy.|$|R

500|$|Billboards {{magazine}} reviewer, Jason Lipshutz, {{called the}} track [...] "an ambitious arena-rock sex jam".
