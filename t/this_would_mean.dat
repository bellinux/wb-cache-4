5|$|The {{first attempt}} to build a modern trade route through the area is {{credited}} to William Jackson Palmer, founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D). Palmer started a project in 1880 to make {{what had been a}} local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of {{blood vessels in the}} skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory would find additional support if Torosaurus was found to be the mature form of Triceratops, as <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure more useful for display than defense.|$|E
5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E

5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it is no more than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

5|$|Tizard put his {{thoughts}} in a 27 April 1936 letter to Hugh Dowding, {{who was at}} that time the Air Member for Research and Development. He also sent a copy to Watt, who forwarded it to the researchers who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> the CH stations would only need to get the fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar {{for the rest of the}} interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.|$|E
5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{casualties}} for {{the battle}} are {{almost impossible to}} estimate precisely {{due to a lack}} of records. It is difficult to determine how many South Korean citizens were forcibly conscripted during the battle and how many deserted as opposed to being killed. Larger engagements destroyed entire regiments and even divisions of North Korean troops, and their strength had to be estimated based on accounts of North Koreans captured by the UN. On September 1, the North Korean army numbered approximately 97,850 in South Korea, and up to one third of this number is suspected to have been conscripts from South Korea. In the aftermath of the Pusan Perimeter battle, only 25,000 or 30,000 of these soldiers returned to North Korea by the end of the month. Upwards of one third of the attacking force became casualties in the fighting. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> North Korean casualties from September 1 to 15 could range from roughly 41,000 to 36,000 killed and captured, with an unknown number of wounded. With the addition of the 5,690 killed in the Bowling Alley, 3,500 at the Naktong Bulge, at least 3,700 at Taegu and an unknown number at P'ohang-dong before September 1, North Korean casualties likely topped 50,000 to 60,000 by the end of the battle. They also lost 239 T-34 tanks and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns; virtually all of the armor they possessed.|$|E
50|$|The large g-force {{likely to}} be {{experienced}} by a ballistic projectile launched in <b>this</b> manner <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that a space gun would be incapable of safely launching humans or delicate instruments, rather being restricted to freight, fuel or ruggedized satellites.|$|R
