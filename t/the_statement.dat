5|$|Several {{procedures}} {{enable the}} Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister {{or members of}} the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of <b>the</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (<b>The</b> <b>statement</b> itself {{requires}} zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove <b>the</b> <b>statement,</b> it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} correct answer for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> that this is true {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E

5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> is false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> was {{the result}} of an intense {{argument}} in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
