500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> into this world as you leave it, on your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E

Hot Games commented on the realism of the game, and how the environment [...] "all {{adds up to a}} totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison". Gamers Depot found the game engaging, stating that they have [...] "yet to play a more immersive game period".|$|E
500|$|S. R. Praveen of The Hindu gave a {{positive}} review: [...] "Syam Pushkaran, {{in writing the}} revenge story, takes away the usual ingredients of hate and anger, and replaces it with lots of humour, arriving as a torrent in one-liners, in situations {{and even in the}} minute gestures of the characters ... Maheshinte Prathikaram provides clean entertainment, treading new paths in that endeavour. If revenge comes like this, let's have more of it". He praised Pothan's direction and Faasil's performance. Sify also had {{a positive}} review: [...] "It's not often <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> across such an intelligent comedy that is extremely funny, thoroughly gripping and brilliantly packaged". The reviewer praised the performances: [...] "One of the best things about this one is the performance of every artiste, both in main roles and also those who are there even in a scene or so". Also praising the screenplay, cinematography, and music, the review concluded: [...] "Maheshinte Prathikaram is one of the finest comedies to have happened in Malayalam during recent years".|$|E

2500|$|Sovereigntists {{have also}} been against the {{presence}} {{of members of the}} Canadian Royal Family in Quebec. At the height of the Quiet Revolution, the Quebec press reported that extreme separatists were plotting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II during her upcoming 1964 tour of the province, as well as to kidnap Premier Jean Lesage's son, should the Queen come to Quebec. Despite fears for the monarch's safety and talk of cancelling the trip, the Queen arrived as planned and, in a speech delivered to the Legislative Assembly on 10 October, in both French and English, spoke of Canada's two [...] "complementary cultures" [...] and the strength of Canada's two founding peoples; she stated: [...] "I am pleased to think that there exists in our Commonwealth a country where I can express myself officially in French... Whenever you sing [...] 'O Canada' you are reminded <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> of a proud race." [...] Still, as her motorcade passed through Quebec City, the route was lined with Quebecers showing their backs to the monarch; others booed her and shouted separatist slogans. Though the protesters were the minority in the crowds gathered to see the Queen (the Montreal Gazette reporting that those who opposed the visit were students numbering in the hundreds) the provincial police violently dispersed those demonstrators who took to marching through the streets, arresting 36, including some who had been there to show loyalty to the Queen.|$|E
2500|$|Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post {{gave the}} film 3.5/4 stars, writing that [...] "The real appeal of Big Hero 6 isn't its action. It's the central character's heart." [...] Maricar Estrella of Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave the film 5 stars, saying it [...] "offers {{something}} for everyone: action, camaraderie, superheroes and villains. But mostly, Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering, and a hug {{that can be}} felt through the screen." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The breakthrough star of the season is here. His name is Baymax and he's impossible not to love. The 3-D animated Big Hero 6 would be a ton less fun without this irresistible blob of roly-poly, robot charisma." [...] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant gave the film 4 out of 5 stars or [...] "excellent," [...] explaining that [...] "Big Hero 6 combines Disney wonder and charm with Marvel awe and action to deliver a film that exhibits {{the best of both}} studios." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "sweet and sharp and exciting and hilarious" [...] and says that the film [...] "comes to the rescue of what's become a dreaded movie trope—the origin story—and launches the superhero tale to pleasurable new heights." [...] Calvin Wilson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film 3.5 of 4 stars, writing that [...] "the storytelling is solid, propelled by characters <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to care about. And that should make Big Hero 6 a big hit." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
