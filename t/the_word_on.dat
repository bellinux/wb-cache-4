25|$|By November 1972 Genie {{could use}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on,</b> {{although}} it was uncertain whether she distinguished between on and in and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing on and in were answers to somebody asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix -ing to describe events in the present progressive. These were the first grammatical markers in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use. Her use of -ing on exclusively dynamic verbs also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus stative verbs, although she did not use it with the verb to be until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave correct responses to it on tests, {{and use of the}} suffix -ing was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained some understanding of number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to count in sequential order in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.|$|E

Stewie is shown asking viewers to change the channel to one which is showing Desperate Housewives. When Peter is describing Jesus, he does so in a similar manner to that shown on Quantum Leap.

500|$|Beynar {{graduated}} from gymnasium (secondary school) in Wilno (Vilnius) and graduated in history from Stefan Batory University in Wilno (his thesis concerned the January Uprising).

After graduating, he finished training for the officer cadet (podchorąży) in the Polish Army. From 1928 to 1937 he lived in Grodno, where he worked as a history teacher in a gymnasium; later he was employed as an announcer for Polish Radio Wilno. Here also, Beynar embarked on his career as author and essayist, writing for a Vilnius conservative newspaper, [...] (<b>The</b> <b>Word).</b> <b>On</b> 11 November 1934 he married Władysława Adamowicz, and in 1938 his daughter Ewa was born.

500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the Internet {{to try to find a}} definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E

[...] In the liner notes for the original soundtrack album, he states that he was [...] "still in high school when that lovable character first made his debut in Final Fantasy", but that the [...] "Chocobo Theme" [...] made a big impression on him, leading him to often think to himself that he would [...] "love to try {{doing this kind of}} work". The soundtrack was the first solo album that Hamauzu had produced. When he wrote his own Chocobo themes for the Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack, he decided to arrange the opening and ending of the album for a fifty-piece orchestra, which lead {{to the creation of the}} orchestrated Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli album. [...] In the liner notes for that album, he explains that his motivation for creating the orchestral works was because [...] "Demand for classical music in Japan is still low compared with other countries" [...] and he wanted [...] "to spread <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> this style of music by any means necessary". He ends the note by exhorting his listeners to [...] "take your time" [...] with classical music such as the album, so that one day they will appreciate it.|$|E
500|$|After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for repeating <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the Golden Globes carpet. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled {{to return to the}} Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday {{for the first time since}} entering [...] "executive counseling" [...] after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore," [...] Washington said in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network. In another report, Washington stated he was planning to [...] "spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show." [...] In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy", referring to Knight, and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a [...] "B-word," [...] a [...] "P-word," [...] and the [...] "F-word," [...] which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back." [...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say [...] "yes". Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode [...] "The Becoming". After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image" [...] and stated he expected this to result in a [...] "financial settlement", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "tip of the tongue" [...] is {{borrowed}} from colloquial usage, {{and possibly a}} calque from the French phrase avoir le mot sur le bout de la langue ("having <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> {{the tip of the}} tongue"). The tip of the tongue phenomenon was first described as a psychological phenomenon in the text The Principles of Psychology by William James (1890), although he did not label it as such.|$|E

2500|$|Murray Krieger {{offers a}} {{different}} view of the contract theory seen within Sonnet 87. In his analysis, he focuses his attention {{on the use of the}} word [...] "dear" [...] within the first line. He notes that the reader's initial deduction of the word [...] "dear" [...] implies the idea of affection. But this initial impression of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the reader is immediately confronted by the word [...] "estimate", which essentially uncovers the reality of the speaker's lowly position to the young man. Kreiger furthermore notes that the legal and financial terms strongly imply the poet's bitterness towards his position: [...] "at having love's world of troth reduced to the niggardly world of truth, the world of faith to the world of fact".|$|E
2500|$|As the {{encyclical}} tells, first are the Catholic bishops. The Council of Trent taught that preaching [...] "is the paramount duty of Bishops." [...] The Apostles, whose successors the bishops are, looked upon the Church as something theirs, {{for it was}} they who received the grace of the Holy Spirit to begin it. Saint Paul wrote to the Corinthians, [...] "Christ sent us not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel." [...] Council of Trent Bishops are required to select for this priestly office those only who are [...] "fit" [...] for the position, i.e. those who [...] "can exercise the ministry of preaching with profit to souls." [...] Profiting souls does not mean doing such [...] "eloquently or with popular applause, but rather with spiritual fruit." [...] The Pope requested that all the priests who are incapable of preaching or of hearing confession {{be removed from the}} position. The encyclical helps to draw out the message that priests must concentrate on <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>on</b> God and the benefitting of souls before their own selves.|$|E
2500|$|In none {{of these}} {{earliest}} references to Christianity’s arrival in Britain is Joseph of Arimathea mentioned. William of Malmesbury's De Antiquitate Glastoniensis Ecclesiae ("On the Antiquity of the Church of Glastonbury", circa 1125) has not survived in its original edition, and the stories involving Joseph of Arimathea are contained in subsequent editions that abound in interpolations placed by the Glastonbury monks [...] "in order to increase the Abbey's prestige– and thus its pilgrim trade and prosperity" [...] In his Gesta Regum Anglorum (History of The Kings of England, finished in 1125), William of Malmesbury wrote that Glastonbury Abbey was built by preachers sent by Pope Eleuterus to Britain, however also adding: [...] "Moreover there are documents of no small credit, which have been discovered in certain places to the following effect: 'No other hands {{than those of the}} disciples of Christ erected the church of Glastonbury';" [...] but here William did not explicitly link Glastonbury with Joseph of Arimathea, but instead emphasizes the possible role of Philip the Apostle: [...] "if Philip, the Apostle, preached to the Gauls, as Freculphus relates in the fourth chapter of his second book, it may be believed that he also planted <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> this side of the channel also." ...|$|E
