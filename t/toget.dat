40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which my artistic practice is creating a space for victims and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault to share, gain catharsis, and spark discussions. As a survivor of domestic violence and sexual assault, I have often felt there was no space for me to voice the many emotions that come with my experience. After creating and sharing autobiographical work about my story, many women have shared their stories of survival with me. Through these many conversations, I knew that we needed to create a space to share these stories. I have created this space through the <b>To(get)</b> her project. <b>To(get)</b> her is a collaborative performance and installation in which women from a variety of backgrounds destroy and transform wax guns with kitchen and cosmetic tools such as waffle irons, hair dryers, high-heeled shoes, curling irons, and meat tenderizers. These wax guns act {{as a metaphor for the}} violence that happens to many women on a daily basis. One in three women will encounter domestic violence and one in five women will be raped in their lifetimes in the United States. Not only are many of our bodies attacked mentally, physically and sexually, but the government also stakes claims on our bodies. With 138 representatives and 22 senators voting against the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and many of those same politicians also voting against stricter gun regulations it is apparent that these politicians do not see it as problematic that women’s bodies are so often targets. Further, in the current political climate it is imperative that people in the United States understand the importance of VAWA, and that it is a necessary bill that will be up for reauthorization in 2018. There have been six iterations of the <b>To(get)</b> her project. Through these performances, over 75 self-identifying women have been a part of the project, sharing their stories and igniting discussion about violence against women.

We show that on general graphs, for {{this class of}} LPs, a non-trivial approximation ratio can be achieved. Namely, for k 2 O(log(aeΔ)), our (deterministic) algorithm achieves a (aeΔ) 1 /k-approximation in O(k 2) rounds, using only messages of size O(log(aeΔ)). Increasing k, we get an(1 + ") -approximation in time O(log 2 (aeΔ) /" 4) and therefore only log 2 rounds are needed in order <b>toget</b> a constant approximation ratio. Additionally, we show that by combining our LP algorithm with randomized rounding techniques, we obtain efficient distributed approximation algorithms for a numberof combinatorial problems. 1 Introduction and Related Work Achieving a global goal based on local information only {{is one of the}} key challenges when developing fastdistributed algorithms.

The method addresses both the problem of untestable timed automata computations and that of too many possible tests. We also present a practical method for managing conformance testing of real-time systems. We show how to interpret timed automata computations for testing purposes using digitisation, hiding and input-output labelling.

40|$|Introduction Reinforcement {{learning}} (RL) {{studies the}} ways animals {{learn about the}} events in their environment that lead to rewards and punishments, and use this information to choose their actions appropriately. RL is minimally supervised since animals are not told explicitly what actions to perform in various situations, but rather must work this out for themselves {{on the basis of}} evaluative information. RL is one of the cases in which it is possible to derive computational, psychological and neurobiological constraints, and in which there are theories that satisfy many of the constraints at all the levels. Various neural systems have been studied from the perspective of RL. One is the cerebellum, a structure implicated in eyeblink conditioning, in which animals learn to shut their eyes just in advance of disturbances such as airpuffs or weak shocks that are signalled by cues. Another is the primate midbrain dopaminergic system and its targets. We focus on the latter, <b>toget...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a Bayesian neural network model. The focus is {{on how to use}} the model for {{automatic}} classification, i. e. on how to train the neural network to classify objects from some domain, given a database of labeled examples from the domain.

This work has been aimed at extending the original Bayesian neural network model, mainly focusing on three different aspects. First the model is extended to a multi-layer network, to relax the independence requirement. This is done by introducing a hidden layer of complex columns, groups of units which take input from the same set of input attributes.
