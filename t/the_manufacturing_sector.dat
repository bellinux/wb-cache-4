5|$|By 1950, {{more than}} half of all {{employment}} was in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector.</b> Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to the severe loss of jobs, the city's population decreased by nearly 30,000 people during that period.|$|E
5|$|The growth {{witnessed}} {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector.</b> Although this was a tough period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the innovative activity of three major Latin American countries – Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico – based on the level of technological intensity of their <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors.</b> In addition to substantial differences with regard to the technological effort put in by <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> firms of these countries, we also found out that the distinction between innovative activity in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> of low or medium-low and medium-high or high technological intensity depends on the maturity of <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> framework of these countries. It was observed that the importance in sorting out <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> according to their technological intensity varies, both in terms of the probability of bringing innovation into the market and of establishing technological strategies for <b>the</b> various <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors.</b> Our study also underscores the importance of interaction of other firm characteristics with the classification of <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> for <b>the</b> determination of such strategies...|$|R

This study explores how <b>the</b> South African <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> can improve its competitiveness through adequate use of ICT. For this purpose, an interpretive analysis of recent literature and document review were employed. This {{study found that the}} initial problem lies within <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector’s</b> inability to successfully identify and integrate the right technologies into business processes. The reason for this is among other factors, the technical skills shortage. The findings of this study can be generalized to those <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> that have not adopted ICT.

5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E

In the 1960s prosperity was fuelled by growth in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector,</b> whereas the 1980s and 1990s saw expansion in the service sector as office based employers relocated to the area. The importance of manufacturing has declined since the 1960s but still employed approximately 17% of the workforce in 2002 and remains more prominent than in the economy of Great Britain as a whole. Sunseeker, the world's largest privately owned builder of motor yachts and the UK's largest manufacturer, is based in Poole and employs over 1,800 people in its Poole shipyards. Other major employers in the local manufacturing industry include Faerch Plast, Hamworthy Heating, Hamworthy Combustion, Lush, Mathmos, Kerry Foods, Transmission Developments, Eurac, Siemens, Southernprint and Ryvita. Poole has the largest number of industrial estates in South East Dorset, including the Nuffield Industrial estate, Mannings Heath, Arena Business Park, Poole Trade Park and the Branksome Business Centre.|$|E
5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. <b>The</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E

However, the total emissions generated by the final demand of sectors exhibited very different patterns. Services played a leading role in these three GHG emissions.
