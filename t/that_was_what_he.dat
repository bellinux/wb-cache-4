25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.|$|E
500|$|Gabe Bartalos {{performed}} the make-up effects. [...] Trimark contacted Bartalos {{to produce a}} sample. [...] Bartalos's early efforts were not to his liking, and he pushed the design in a more grotesque direction, as <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to see on the screen as a horror fan. [...] Bartalos's design impressed Trimark, and he got the account. [...] Applying the make-up took three hours, and taking it off took another 40 minutes. [...] Davis described the experience as [...] "not a pleasant sensation". [...] To pass the time while the make-up was being applied, Davis said he had bizarre conversations with Bartalos, with whom he got along well. [...] Davis was conscious {{of the need to}} stay relaxed and not move, and he channelled his confidence that the make-up effects were properly applied into his acting.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust– nevertheless, the courts found <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized {{his friend}} and {{sometime}} client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, [...] "The question this government needs to answer is {{why it was so}} necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was not willing to accept." [...] Cory Doctorow wrote, [...] "Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{he wrote}} [...] "Eureka", Yamaguchi became sick both {{physically}} and mentally, developing hives and becoming disillusioned {{with the idea of}} writing music for other entities. The song was inspired by Yamaguchi's feelings of becoming too accustomed to making songs for others. Yamaguchi's poor mental state affected the song while he was writing it. He wrote the song's lyrics over the course of one night in Adobe Illustrator, while he sat with the curtains shut in front of his computer in his apartment, but spent much of the time revising the song. The lyrics mention , a tea meant to detoxify the body according to Japanese folk medicine, because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been drinking during that night to aid himself.|$|E
2500|$|D. H. Lawrence took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in {{the final}} book he wrote, Apocalypse. He saw the {{language}} which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called [...] "the sovereignty of the intellect" [...] which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled [...] "vulgarity" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> found in Revelation. [...] "It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rockwell's {{work was}} {{dismissed}} by serious art critics in his lifetime. Many {{of his works}} appear overly sweet {{in the opinion of}} modern critics, especially the Saturday Evening Post covers, which tend toward idealistic or sentimentalized portrayals of American life. This has led to the often-deprecatory adjective, [...] "Rockwellesque". Consequently, Rockwell is not considered a [...] "serious painter" [...] by some contemporary artists, who regard his work as bourgeois and kitsch. Writer Vladimir Nabokov sneered that Rockwell's brilliant technique was put to [...] "banal" [...] use, and wrote in his book Pnin: [...] "That Dalí is really Norman Rockwell's twin brother kidnapped by Gypsies in babyhood". He is called an [...] "illustrator" [...] instead of an artist by some critics, a designation he did not mind, as <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called himself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} Congressional {{investigation was}} chaired by James A. Garfield. Grant's decision {{to counter the}} escalating price of gold did not completely dispel rumors {{that he and his}} administration had profited from the affair. The investigation was alleged on the one hand to have been limited because Virginia Corbin and First Lady Julia Grant were not permitted to testify. Garfield's biographer, Alan Peskin, however, maintains the investigation was quite thorough. The investigation cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould for his manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connections to Grant. Butterfield was implicated for serving as a double agent giving information to Gould. [...] In his Congressional testimony, Gould said Grant [...] "was a very pure, high-minded man; that if he was satisfied what was the best thing to do, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would do." ...|$|E
2500|$|During November 1939, Halder conspired with General Brauchitsch. Halder {{declared}} that he would support Brauchitsch {{if he were to}} try to curtail Hitler's plans for further expansion of the war, but Brauchitsch declined (the so-called Zossen Conspiracy). Brauchitsch and Halder had decided to overthrow Hitler after the latter had fixed [...] "X-day" [...] for the invasion of France for 12 November 1939, an invasion that both officers believed to be doomed to failure. During a meeting with Hitler on 5 November, Brauchitsch had attempted to talk Hitler into putting off [...] "X-day" [...] by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than what it was in 1918. This statement enraged Hitler, who then harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence. After that meeting, both Halder and Brauchitsch told Carl Friedrich Goerdeler that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do, and that he should find other officers if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really wanted to do. Equally important, following heavy snowstorms, on 7 November 1939 Hitler put off [...] "X-Day" [...] until further notice, removing the reason that had most motivated Brauchitsch and Halder to consider overthrowing Hitler. On 23 November 1939, Goerdeler met with Halder to ask him to reconsider his attitude. Halder gave Goerdeler the following reasons why he {{wanted nothing to do with}} any plot to overthrow Hitler: ...|$|E
