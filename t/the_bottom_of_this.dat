25|$|During the Watergate scandal, Rabbi Greenwald {{contacted}} various Democratic Jewish {{members of}} Congress, including Elizabeth Holtzman, Bella Abzug and Arlen Specter {{to try to}} convince them that impeaching the President would weaken the United States and, by extension, hurt Israel, which, {{in the wake of the}} Yom Kippur War needed the support of a strong United States.

25|$|The on-line {{calendar}} converters cited at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> page all {{give the}} current Fasli year (following Nawruz in AD 2011) as 1381 Y.Z. – {{the same year}} as the Qadimi and Shahanshahi. However, the accumulated leap days not reckoned in the latter two calendars add up to a whole year in just over 1508 years. Since there is exactly one Fasli year for every Gregorian year, then day one of the proleptic Fasli calendar would be 21 March (Gregorian) AD 631, with Year 2 beginning on 21 March AD 632. But Yazdegird III did not ascend the throne until 19 June AD 632 (Gregorian), leading to the curious quirk that the base date for the reckoning of years ends up in Year 2 of the Fasli calendar.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} itself underwent extensions by the architect James Gandon, as Pearce had died young. Gandon {{was responsible for}} three of Dublin's finest buildings, the Custom House, the Four Courts and the King's Inns. Between 1785 and 1789 he added a new peers' entrance at {{the east of the}} building, facing onto Westmoreland Street. Unlike the main entrance to the south, which {{came to be known as}} the House of Commons entrance, the new peers' entrance used six Corinthian columns, at the request of peers who wished their entrance to be distinct from the Ionic columns of the main entrance. Over this, three statues by Edward Smyth were placed, representing Fortitude, Justice and Liberty. A curved wall joined the Pearce entrance to Gandon's extension. This did not mark the exterior of the building but masked the uneven joins of some of the extension, as shown in the view at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> page. The wall, built of granite with inset alcoves, although an instantly recognisable aspect of the building today, bears little resemblance to the building as it was in its parliamentary days.|$|E

500|$|Given this {{reliance}} on literary sources, {{it is doubtful}} whether Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a trance state, other than contemplation, meditation and incubation. His sole description {{of this process is}} contained in letter 41 of his collected Latin correspondence. The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the Delphic and Branchidic oracles. The first of these is reproduced at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links). In his dedication to King Henri II, Nostradamus describes [...] "emptying my soul, mind and heart of all care, worry and unease through mental calm and tranquility", but his frequent references to the [...] "bronze tripod" [...] of the Delphic rite are usually preceded by the words [...] "as though" [...] (compare, once again, External References to the original texts).|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E

500|$|The British Malakand Field Force {{used the}} town of Nowshera as a base of operations. Nowshera was located south of the Kabul River [...] "six hours by rail from Rawal Pindi". Commanded by Colonel Schalch, the base served as a {{hospital}} while the normal garrison was serving 47 miles (76km) away at Malakand Pass in what {{was known as the}} Malakand South Camp. This force consisted of one British cavalry regiment, one Indian cavalry regiment and one Indian infantry battalion. Winston Churchill, who would accompany the relief force as a second lieutenant and war correspondent, described the camp as [...] "...a great cup, of which the rim is broken into numerous clefts and jagged points. At <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cup is the 'crater' camp." [...] Churchill goes on to state that the camp was viewed as purely temporary and was indefensible, {{as a result of its}} cramped conditions and the fact that it was dominated by the surrounding heights. A nearby camp, North Malakand, was also established on the plains of Khar, intended to hold the large number of troops that were unable to fit into the main camp. Both of these positions were garrisoned for two years with little fear of attack by a 1,000 strong force. Officers brought their families, and the camp held regular polo matches and shooting competitions.|$|E
500|$|Twentieth-century scholarship's {{focus on}} the doubt {{expressed}} by Boniface regarding {{the authenticity of the}} Libellus has led to the widely held belief that a general atmosphere of suspicion surrounded the Libellus in the Middle Ages. In fact, Boniface appears to have been the only medieval personality to have ever expressed doubt about the authorship of this letter. As missionary to the Germanic peoples of Europe and legate of the papal see, Boniface spent much of his later life in Continental Europe, where he encountered many canonical traditions that were unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxons and that appeared to Boniface out of step with his knowledge of church tradition. The Libellus represented one such tradition. Boniface in fact had very practical reasons for questioning the Libellus. He had witnessed its recommendations being exploited by certain members of the Frankish nobility who claimed that the Libellus permitted them to enter into unions with their aunts, unions Boniface considered to be incestuous. Eager to get to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> controversy, in 735 Boniface wrote to Nothhelm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, requesting Nothhelm send him Canterbury's own copy of the Libellus; presumably Boniface hoped that Canterbury (being the one-time residence of Augustine) possessed an authentic copy of the Libellus, one that perhaps preserved more ancient readings than the copies then circulating in France and Bavaria, and would therefore serve as a corrective to the Continental copies and the incestuous nobles who relied upon them. Boniface also requested Nothhelm's opinion on the document's authenticity, for his own inquiries at the papal archives had failed to turn up an official [...] "registered" [...] copy of the letter there. His failed attempt to locate a [...] "registered" [...] papal copy of the Libellus presumably suggested to Boniface the possibility that the document was spurious and had in fact not been authored by Pope Gregory I.|$|E
500|$|The train departs {{the station}} {{to the right and}} climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the [...] lift hill, {{carrying}} the riders into the [...] mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At {{the top of the mountain}} the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain, coming to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch rotates in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main [...] drop. It enters a 250° turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is reaching down toward it. On reaching <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. One ride takes about 2 minutes and 50 seconds.|$|E
