50|$|Protagonist Gus Bailey, {{introduced}} in Dunne's earlier novel People Like Us, {{is a successful}} writer who is assigned to cover <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>trial</b> for Vanity Fair. He firmly believes Simpson is guilty from the very beginning, and in his monthly column Letter from Los Angeles, he clearly states his position and puts his personal spin on what he observes in the courtroom and beyond. Those involved with the criminal proceedings, including Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden for the prosecution, Johnnie Cochran, F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Barry Scheck, and Robert Shapiro for the defense, and Judge Lance Ito, all figure prominently in the story.|$|E

Despite their team's success in freeing Simpson after the verdict, Shapiro criticized his fellow Dream Team {{attorneys}} F.

Simpson Case (1998), Shapiro states {{that he does not}} believe Simpson was framed by the LAPD for racial reasons but does believe the verdict was correct due to reasonable doubt. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>trial,</b> Shapiro steered his practice away from criminal defense toward civil litigation.|$|E

Anyone involved in such a conspiracy would have been risking their life, because California law at that time stated that anyone who fabricated evidence in a death penalty case—as the Brown and Goldman murder case might have become—could be sentenced to death themselves. Bugliosi further stated that Fuhrman {{was one of the}} victims in the case and that his lying under oath about racial epithets did not {{rise to the level of}} indictable perjury, because it was immaterial to the actual facts of the case.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with every}} other daytime soap, The Young and the Restless has {{suffered}} audience erosion, with very noticeable losses during the O.J. Simpson trial. For many months, The Young and the Restless was not shown at its regularly scheduled time during the televised Simpson trial. A trailer sometimes ran {{at the bottom of}} the TV screen informing viewers to use their VCRs to tape Y&R at random hours like 2:27 a.m., 4:26 a.m. There was not a set re-broadcast time after midnight, and this was years before the internet was in homes, which would have allowed viewers to watch online as you can in 2014. Many long-time viewers simply gave up trying to figure out when to set their VCRs, and gave up permanently on the show. Y&R permanently lost millions of viewers as a result.
