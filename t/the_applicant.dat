5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> and {{her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a {{circular}} imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected the applicant's redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> argued before the High Court that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to <b>the</b> <b>applicant,</b> who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. <b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Public or {{representative}} standing {{is standing}} possessed by an applicant who brings a case {{on behalf of}} a larger group of people, or even {{in the interest of the}} general public. <b>The</b> <b>applicant</b> need not show that a personal right or interest has been infringed.

5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E
5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> must submit evidence showing that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had adopted the mark in good faith, that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from <b>the</b> <b>applicant,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{earned a}} general score of 7.0 during <b>the</b> <b>Applicant</b> phase, after a {{detailed}} study of <b>the</b> <b>Applicant</b> Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008.

The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by <b>the</b> <b>applicant</b> must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
