5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Clouzot was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all. Clouzot's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed {{because many of the}} producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E

They had received the rites of death, were dressed in white, and had had their ritual kris blessed.|$|E

Like most of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.|$|R

500|$|As owner Sam Malone {{opens the}} Cheers bar, a {{professor}} Sumner Sloane (Michael McGuire) and his Boston University student fiancée Diane Chambers {{are the first}} customers. They are planning to go to Barbados to be married, but {{do not have a}} wedding ring; Sumner leaves to get the ring from his ex-wife. While she waits, Diane learns about <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the bar. Sam is an ex-baseball player and a recovering alcoholic.

Sumner returns a few hours later, suggesting Cool Hand Luke as a [...] "sweaty" [...] movie and telling Diane he could not get his ex-wife's ring. His ex-wife calls the bar with a change of heart, and Sumner leaves Diane again.|$|E
500|$|Both Kiedis and Slovak {{struggled}} with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse {{as the band}} was preparing to record Uplift. [...] Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation {{to contribute to the}} band musically, and appeared at rehearsal [...] "literally asleep". He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation. [...] During that time, the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey. He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance. [...] He checked into Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids, an experience which he initially detested until he noted that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him. [...] He moved in with his mother after twenty days at the clinic, a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was eleven years old. [...] After Kiedis completed his stint in rehabilitation, he felt a [...] "whole new wave of enthusiasm" [...] due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song entitled [...] "Fight Like a Brave" [...] on the flight home. He rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record the group's next album.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{standard}} case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, {{which is less}} than 1 chance in 16. [...] For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you, n {{would need to be}} at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365/2 = 182.5: the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the room.|$|E

2500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Joe Nocera continued this argument. He {{also took}} issue with how the book was promoted by the 'Murdoch Empire' as a [...] "newly discovered" [...] novel, attesting that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Sothebys meeting insisted that Lee's attorney was present in 2011, when Lee's former agent (who was subsequently fired) and the Sotheby's specialist found the manuscript. They said she knew full well {{that it was the}} same one submitted to Tay Hohoff in the 1950s that was reworked into Mockingbird, and that Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee's affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Funk {{musician}} George Clinton {{was hired}} to produce the band's second album, Freaky Styley, as Slovak returned on guitar. The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Freaky Styley was released in August 1985. It received only a bit more attention than The Red Hot Chili Peppers with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end. The band hired Michael Beinhorn, their last resort among potential producers, {{to work on their}} next album. What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that [...] "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy". Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves. Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. [...] Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal [...] "literally asleep". He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation. [...] During that time, the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey.
