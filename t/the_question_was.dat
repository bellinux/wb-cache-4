5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Chana's first {{teacher was}} D.C. Sears, an Oregon, Illinois resident. The late 19th century saw {{at least ten}} {{individuals}} teach at Chana School at different times. By 1888, Pine Rock Township was ready {{to address the question}} of whether or not to build a high school; Chana students attended high school in Oregon. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to Oregon schools after eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|France outlawed {{the most}} radical {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long guerrilla war and {{the assassination of the}} party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E
5000|$|The closer [...] is to 0, {{the more}} {{unpredictable}} <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is.</b> [...] for every <b>question</b> <b>is</b> calculated. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> for which , <b>are</b> <b>the</b> set of almost unpredictable <b>questions</b> and <b>the</b> next <b>question</b> <b>is</b> randomly picked from these.|$|R
50|$|The first reel has a {{range of}} {{categories}} of questions on it, each given a star rating of up to three stars. One star means <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of easy difficulty, two stars mean <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of medium difficulty and three stars mean <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of hard difficulty. After a category has been used, it {{is replaced by a}} new category, with any unused categories from a previous show being re-used.|$|R
50|$|The host read <b>the</b> <b>question</b> twice, and <b>is</b> {{given some}} freedom to {{paraphrase}} <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> Contestants may answer {{as soon as}} <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> first read.|$|R
5|$|In 2010 Bamber's lawyers {{highlighted}} {{two police}} logs {{in support of}} Bamber's application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position {{that there were two}} calls to police, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War in September, {{construction}} continued desultorily until October when it was suspended by the Admiralty for one year to release labour and material for escorts needed to protect merchant convoys. Construction of the 16-inch guns and their turrets was to continue, however. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> raised again on 12 November 1940 and the decision to suspend construction was reaffirmed. All three ships ordered were cancelled in 1942, but Lions keel was not scrapped until {{after the end of the}} war. Only four 16-inch guns, and no turrets, were ever completed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} June 2013, Labor's {{standing}} in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election. With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{thought of}} having his diary {{published}} mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the Narrative. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his diary, and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his Journal and Remarks (now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle) in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; a referendum on <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
30|$|This {{is a short}} {{measure of}} general health [11]. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{answered}} via multiple choice options and are grouped to produce eight health scales in two main categories, physical health and mental health. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> then each scored to produce the physical and mental component summary scores.|$|R
50|$|The final segment, {{which has}} {{remained}} unchanged, has {{the winner of}} the third segment answering a difficult riddle or trivia <b>question.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> answered correctly, <b>the</b> amount in the pot is deposited into the donation pot. If <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> answered incorrectly, <b>the</b> day's amount is lost.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{a subject}} of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> located inside a [...] "black box" [...] which is brought {{into the room and}} placed on the table but not opened until the correct answer is announced. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> usually ended with the phrase [...] "what's in the black box?" ...|$|R
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{finally settled}} when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye {{provided}} for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. <b>The</b> <b>Question</b> <b>was</b> also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
5|$|Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb {{would never}} escape the public {{identification}} {{of them with}} the case. In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President John F. Kennedy decided that {{the time had come}} to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 Enrico Fermi Award. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was assassinated later that day. The award was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson instead. Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether recommendations could be made for colonial troops not serving with British troops was not asked in New Zealand, but in 1881, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked in South Africa. Surgeon John McCrea, {{an officer of the}} South African forces was recommended for gallantry during hostilities which had not been approved by the British Government. He was awarded the Victoria Cross and the principle was established that gallant conduct could be rewarded independently of any political consideration of military operations. More recently, four Australian soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross in Vietnam although Britain was not involved in the conflict.|$|E
5000|$|To {{encourage}} {{viewers to}} keep watching, a [...] "pub ammo" [...] <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked before <b>the</b> commercial break, {{with the answer}} being revealed at <b>the</b> end. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> general knowledge and trivia based; the idea being <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> could <b>be</b> asked in a pub quiz.|$|R

5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> raised whether Christ had offered {{himself as a}} sacrifice {{for the sins of}} the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Discovery Channel began airing a {{spin-off}} {{edition of}} the program, Cash Cab: After Dark, in which contestants were picked up near or after sunset as well as overnight and the cash value of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> double that of the regular version of <b>the</b> show. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> usually more difficult than the daytime version.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{of this show}} is that the anonymous listeners send cultural or obscure <b>questions</b> to <b>the</b> famous guests of the day (actors, comedians and entertainers), and get a small cash prize if <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not answered correctly. Of course <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> just a pretext for the guests to exercise their wit and good humor.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not, <b>the</b> {{property}} of the Church, or its security. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> whether you will render the principle of prescription a principle {{of the law of}} this laud, and incorporate it with the whole of your jurisprudence,--whether, having given it first against the laity, then against the crown, you will now extend it to the Church.|$|R
