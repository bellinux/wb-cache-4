500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E

2500|$|The World Health Organization {{has stated}} that women in abusive {{relations}} are at significantly higher risk of HIV/AIDS. WHO states that women in violent relations have difficulty negotiating safer sex with their partners, are often forced to have sex, and {{find it difficult to}} ask for appropriate testing when they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be infected with HIV. A decade of cross-sectional research from Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa, and India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV. The WHO stated that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Among the coffins {{were four}} bodies which were unidentified, and {{appeared}} to be remains of children. [...] One coffin was simply labelled as 'little girl, unrecognisable,' and another as 'three trunks, probably children'. [...] As no children were reported missing the railway company moved the bodies to Glasgow for possible identification, but no one came forward to claim the bodies; some <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been soldiers' bodies badly shrivelled and reduced by burning. The four were buried in Glasgow's Western Necropolis on 26 May. The engine crew of the troop train were both from Carlisle, and they were also buried on 26 May at Stanwix Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|The true {{meaning of}} the symbols of the flag may be tied to ancient history. Stars were a device {{representing}} man's desire to achieve greatness. The common metaphor [...] "reaching for the stars" [...] developed from this idea. Stars of various shapes were also important symbols in European heraldry, and stars appears in colonial flags as early as 1676 Another possibility may come from Freemasonry. Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Robert Livingston, Paul Revere, and other important people of that period belonged to the fraternal order. Some may <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have influenced the inclusion of stars in the American flag, however, stars of this type, although sometimes used as a decorative device, like pyramids, were not an important icon in Freemasonry.|$|E

5000|$|Naŋa dama, {{also known}} as Naŋa tegu, is a Dogon {{language}} spoken in Mali that is only known from one report from 1953. Roger Blench reports that its nearest relative is the recently described Walo-Kumbe Dogon, [...] "with which it shares both lexicon and the feature that many nouns have a final -m." [...] Hochstetler <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be the same language. It may be close to Yanda Dogon (Blench) or Jamsai tegu (Hochstetler).|$|R

50|$|Pasto and Muellama {{are usually}} {{classified}} as Barbacoan, {{but the current}} evidence is weak and deserves further attention. Muellama {{may have been one}} of the last surviving dialects of Pasto (both extinct, replaced by Spanish) — Muellama is known only by a short wordlist recorded in the 19th century. The Muellama vocabulary is similar to modern Awa Pit. The Cañari-Puruhá languages are ever more poorly attested, and while often placed in a Chimuan family, Adelaar (2004:397) <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been Barbacoan.|$|R

60|$|Besides what we {{have already}} {{mentioned}} concerning ideas, other considerations belong to them, in reference to THINGS FROM WHENCE THEY ARE TAKEN, or WHICH THEY MAY BE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT; and thus, I <b>think,</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> come under a threefold distinction, and are:--First, either real or fantastical; Secondly, adequate or inadequate; Thirdly, true or false.|$|E

2500|$|....a {{practical}} man, {{rough and}} ready in his manners and quick to decry any appearance of affection in others... Though capable of great exertion in an emergency, he normally feels no impulse {{to work hard}} without good cause. He swears hard and consistently, gambles heavily and often, and drinks deeply on occasion... he is a greater knocker of eminent people unless, as is {{in the case of}} his sporting heroes, they are distinguished by physical prowess. He is fiercely independent... above all he will stick to his mates though thick and thin, even if he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be wrong... He tends to be a rolling stone, highly suspect if he should chance to gather much moss.|$|R
