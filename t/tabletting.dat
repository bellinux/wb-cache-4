50|$|The {{processes}} used {{to manufacture}} orally disintegrating tablets include loose compression <b>tabletting,</b> {{a process which}} is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and lyophilization processes. In loose compression, ODTs are compressed at much lower forces (4 - 20 kN) than traditional tablets. However, since ODTs are compressed at very low forces due {{to the need to}} them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging. Typically, as in most tablet blends, lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend {{to reduce the amount of}} material that may stick to the die wall. Differences may be the use of disintegrating aids, such as crospovidone, and binding agents that aid in mouth feel, such as microcrystalline cellulose. Primarily, ODTs contain some form of sugar such as mannitol, which typically serves as the major diluent of the ODTs, and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most ODTs. Lyophilized ODT formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster disintegration rate, for example the Zydis ODT typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water. ODTs are available in HPDE bottles (Parcopa) or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage, moisture, and oxidation. Because ODTs are soft in nature, the ability to successfully package an ODT in a bottle is difficult. However, CIMA Labs markets their Durasolv ODT as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale, while CIMA's Orasolv is marketed for blisters only. Zydis ODT tablets manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions are delivered in a blister pack. The differences between the two CIMA products are proprietary, however, the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), such as Avicel PH101, in the Durasolv product. MCC serves multiple purposes in an ODT but in the case of CIMA's products, it acts as a binder, increasing the internal strength of the tablet and making it more robust for packaging in bottles.|$|E

40|$|Instrumented presses used in <b>tabletting</b> {{research}} and development are normally equipped to measure punch force and displacement. Die-wall monitoring is rare, probably because instrumentation and calibration are quite difficult. The authors critically examine the tenets of radial pressure measurement in compression physics. The theoretical background concerning axial to radial stress transmission during the different phases of the compression cycle is presented. The literature reporting {{on the use of}} radial stress measurement to assess the self-lubricating properties of materials or the effect of lubricants is reviewed. Examples of interpretation of radial pressure cycles to define the basic material behaviour are given. The influence of particle size and shape {{as well as that of}} process and formulation variables on die-wall response are also discussed. Substantial inconsistencies can be seen in the literature with respect to the interpretation of experimental data, often because of the poor reliability of results and mostly because powders are essentially not solid, isotropic bodies. There is also a distinct lack of complementary <b>tabletting</b> parameters that would help understanding their comparative benefits. For this reason, original data on 13 model compounds are presented together with a classification of the materials encountered in pharmaceutical <b>tabletting,</b> based on selected parameters. In conclusion, none of the determined parameters, including those derived from radial pressure measurement, is able, alone, to predict the material behaviour under compression. Although die-wall instrumentation contributes little to the development of improved tablet formulations, it is valuable for characterising the mechanical properties of the materials. This is particularly advantageous given that the mechanical properties account for variations in <b>tabletting</b> performance to a much greater extent than the magnitude of the interparticulate attractions. Nevertheless, because of the peculiar nature of powders compared to solid, isotropic bodies, there is a need to develop new models for analysing their behaviour and to put more emphasis on examination of time-dependent deformation in the later stage of the compression cycle...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the matrix {{strength}} of sodium chloride particles in pure sodium chloride <b>tablets</b> and in <b>tablets</b> compressed from binary mixtures of sodium chloride with low concentrations of pregelatinised starch. Because this study concerns {{the strength of the}} sodium chloride matrix, the <b>tablet</b> strength is reflected {{as a function of the}} sodium chloride volume fraction in the <b>tablet.</b> Starch particles in the mixture <b>tablets</b> decrease the sodium chloride volume fraction-tensile strength relationship compared with that of pure sodium chloride <b>tablets.</b> To determine the contribution of the sodium chloride matrix to the <b>tablet</b> strength, the starch particles were removed from the mixture <b>tablets</b> by heat treatment. Determination of the strengths of these heat-treated <b>tablets</b> reveals that the sodium chloride matrix strength determines the <b>tablet</b> strength of mixture <b>tablets</b> containing a single matrix of sodium chloride particles. The decrease of the sodium chloride matrix density in the three different <b>tablets</b> (pure sodium chloride <b>tablets,</b> mixture <b>tablets</b> and heat-treated <b>tablets)</b> is reflected by an increase of the median pore size. The matrix in sodium chloride <b>tablets</b> shows a higher tensile strength to median pore size relation than the matrices in the mixture and heat-treated <b>tablets.</b> Based on calculations according to the theory of elastic-brittle fracture, it is suggested that the initial presence of starch particles during <b>tablet</b> compaction causes the pores in the matrices of the mixtures and heat-treated <b>tablets</b> to be relatively more flat and longer.

40|$|The {{compaction}} behaviour of {{a commercial}} granulated clay (magnesium aluminium smectite, gMgSm) was investigated using macroscopic pressure-density measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray microtomography (XμT) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). This material was studied as a potential compaction excipient for pharmaceutical <b>tabletting,</b> {{but also as a}} model system demonstrating the capabilities of SAXS for investigating compaction in other situations. Bulk compaction measurements showed that the gMgSm was more difficult to compact than polymeric pharmaceutical excipients such as spheronised microcrystalline cellulose (sMCC), corresponding to harder granules. Moreover, in spite of using lubrication (magnesium stearate) on the tooling surfaces, rather high ejection forces were observed, which may cause problems during commercial <b>tabletting,</b> requiring further amelioration. Although the compacted gMgSm specimens were more porous, however, they still exhibited acceptable cohesive strengths, comparable to sMCC. Hence, there may be scope for using granular clay as one component of a <b>tabletting</b> formulation. Following principles established in previous work, SAXS revealed information concerning the intragranular structure of the gMgSm and its response to compaction. The results showed that little compression of the intragranular morphology occurred below a relative density of 0 · 6, suggesting that granule rearrangements or fragmentation were the dominant mechanisms during this stage. By contrast, granule deformation became considerably more important at higher relative density, which also coincided with {{a significant increase in the}} cohesive strength of compacted specimens. Spatially-resolved SAXS data was also used to investigate local variations in compaction behaviour within specimens of different shape. The results revealed the expected patterns of density variations within flat-faced cylindrical specimens. Significant variations in density, the magnitude of compressive strain and principal strain direction were also revealed in the vicinity of a debossed feature (a diametral notch) and within bi-convex specimens. The variations in compaction around the debossed notch, with a small region of high density below and low density along the flanks, appeared to be responsible for extensive cracking, which could also cause problems in commercial <b>tabletting...</b>|$|E
40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is a {{dry granulation}} technology, used to overcome unfavorable physical properties of powders and APIs, such as poor flow, low and/or inhomogeneous bulk density or segregation/floating of powder blends. Associated with many advantageous properties, {{one of the}} major roller compaction drawbacks is the potential for relatively high amounts of fine particles < 0. 1 mm after milling of the ribbons – they can partially disintegrate into their primary particles. For eight blends with different amounts of fine, medium and coarse granules fractions it could be shown that the flow properties of the blends as well as the tablets tensile strength significantly suffered from the presence of roller compacted fines. Higher amounts of fines (45 % and 60 %) surprisingly over-compensated this effect: now the high number of particles and their large surface area appears to be predominant – despite the poor flow. The best tensile strength data derived from the medium fraction 0. 1 - 1. 0 mm: the wide variety of smaller and larger particles with good flow properties easily aligns during filling and compression phase. For the coarse particles 1. 0 - 1. 25 mm, their limited specific surface area and therefore reduced ability to establish interparticular bindings has minor negative impact on the blends compressibility. For gentle milling of the ribbons, four different milling devices as well as their settings (different sieve screen sizes and types, rotors, rotor speeds, rotor/sieve distances, etc) were evaluated: the integrated Gerteis granulator with newly modified sieve housing delivered the best results, whereas for smaller ribbons quantities also the independently driven Frewitt mill GLA_ORV prove to be a viable option. Low amounts of dry binders (PEG 1500 and 4000, PVP K 30, PVP/VA copolymer, HPC) were added to the standard formulation MCC to reduce fines after milling: for this purpose and for batch variability during milling already 3 % PEG 1500 had a positive impact, but tablets crushing strength dropped by 20 %. 9 % PVP K 30 is required for fines reduction by 6. 1 %, the best overall result; however, tablets disintegration time is higher. To learn more about excipients for roller compaction, compression trials were performed with pure excipients and rather formulation-like 1 : 1 blends with MCC. The objective was to get information about the manufacturing methods comparability (direct <b>tabletting</b> vs. roller compaction/tabletting vs. texture analyzer, TA) and the extend of their predictability. The tablet’s crushing strength of each formulation is calculated by using the slope’s formula for data standardization and direct comparison in a metric ranking order, like for the three different sets of TA data. The direct <b>tabletting</b> data prove to be predictable with a relatively high probability from TA compression of powders. To a limited extend this is also valid for prediction of roller compaction feasibility, using direct <b>tabletting</b> trials as well as the three TA characterization systems. Here the TA compression of powders is preferred if only a limited amount of material is available. If time is more critical than material availability, a roller compaction trial should be considered in order to manufacture a few intact ribbons at different compaction force levels: milling and <b>tabletting</b> of the ribbons can be skipped by assessing the ribbons properties with the TA. Looking into the excipients, MCC of adequately small d 50 (type Avicel PH 101) reaches the best scores for direct <b>tabletting</b> and roller compaction / <b>tabletting</b> and justifies being the basic ingredient of roller compaction formulations. In contrast to that, the much larger particles of Avicel PH 200 are not appropriate for this process. Despite its poor performance as pure excipient in direct <b>tabletting</b> and roller compaction / <b>tabletting,</b> Tablettose 70 shows unexpectedly good results in the 1 : 1 blend with Avicel PH 101, so this combination can be considered for formulation development. Less suited are, mannitol (type Pearlitol SD 200) and pregelatinized starch (type Cerestar 93000) {{do not seem to be}} well suited for roller compaction purposes, but the latter can help as tablet disintegration aid in low proportions...|$|E
