5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The company {{had the right to}} collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by the county municipality, and would have to pay NOK27 million for <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> with the county paying {{for the rest of the}} costs. The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 and take the risk of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{had been}} completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{are located}} on the Ankara-Tarsus {{motorway}} [...] between Kemerhisar and Pozantı connecting the Central Anatolia Region with the Mediterranean Region. Five of <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> in <b>the</b> north are in Niğde Province while the remaining two are situated in Adana Province.

5|$|During {{construction}} or winter storms that require closing Loveland Pass, {{there is a}} procedure in place to allow hazardous material trucks to use <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Once per hour, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> bores will be closed to regular traffic, and the trucks will be guided through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> in a convoy with escorts.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} entrance {{gateway to}} <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{also known as}} Southern Tunnel House, was designed by LCC architect Thomas Blashill and was built just before <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was completed. It comprises two floors with an attic.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{continues}} east under I Street {{and between}} Farragut West and McPherson Square stations {{there is a}} non-revenue branch track that connects with the Red Line. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> then turns south under 12th Street Northwest and enters the lower level of the Metro Center station. After Smithsonian station, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> turns east under D Street Southwest and then southeast under Pennsylvania Avenue Southeast. At Potomac Avenue station, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> briefly travels under G Street Southeast and then turns northwest under Potomac Avenue with a turn to the north to travel under 19th Street Southeast for the Stadium-Armory station. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> then travels under the RFK Stadium parking lots to surface near Benning Road. The elevated tracks follow Benning Road across the Anacostia River and then split from the Blue and Silver lines. There is a pocket track just west of this split.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{proved to}} be a {{constant}} nuisance to the Chicago Great Western and its predecessors. Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was bored, ground water seepage, and the isolated location of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> meant repairs would be frequent and costly. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved inadequate, and were replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant that large-scale reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was needed in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was officially}} opened by the Prince of Wales on 22 May 1897. The {{total cost of}} <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was £1.4 M and 800 men were {{employed}} in its construction, during which seven deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald Bye and officially taken into use on 1 June. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{including}} Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170 million. At first, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and Nationaltheatret {{was used by}} commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and turned at Skøyen. On 27 May 1989, OsloV was closed and all traffic started running via Nationaltheatret.|$|E

5|$|Trains {{have been}} {{cancelled}} or delayed because of flooding in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Water still runs fast into <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{and in the}} 1960s a train was derailed by a 3-ton (3.3 tonne) icicle.|$|E
5|$|Wadhurst Tunnel {{collapsed}} in 1862 {{and it was}} discovered by the SER that the same situation existed there too. Rectification cost £10,231. By 1877, only one train was permitted in Bopeep Tunnel at a time. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> was partly widened in 1934–35. In November 1949, serious defects were discovered in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Single-line working {{was put in place}} on 19November, but <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> had to be closed completely a week later. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> was partially relined with cast iron segments. It reopened to traffic on 5June 1950. Mountfield Tunnel was underpinned in 1938–39, remaining open with single-line working in operation. It partially collapsed on 17November 1974, resulting in single-line working until 31January 1975.

5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{accidents}} involving semi-trailer trucks prompted local political candidates {{to push for}} trucks to be banned from <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> diverting them to the nearby I-470.|$|E
5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> would rise on {{the completion of}} the M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels {{would not be able to}} cope with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E
50|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{was successfully}} {{used to construct}} <b>tunnels</b> throughout <b>the</b> world, notably <b>the</b> Fréjus Rail <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>the</b> Gotthard Rail <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>the</b> Simplon <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>the</b> Jungfraubahn and even <b>the</b> longest road <b>tunnel</b> in <b>the</b> world, Lærdalstunnelen, are constructed using this method.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> with large concrete plugs.
