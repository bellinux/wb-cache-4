5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E

25|$|Halperin {{believes}} that {{the appearance of the}} English translation of the first volume of Foucault's The History of Sexuality in 1978, together with the publication of classical scholar Kenneth Dover's Greek Homosexuality the same year, marked {{the beginning of a new}} era in the study of the history of sexuality.

25|$|In October 1933, Wills {{was fired}} {{and a new}} group of Doughboys went to Chicago for a {{recording}} session with Vocalion (later Columbia) Records.

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> world (sometimes more {{precisely}} as Greco-Roman world) {{adopted by the}} Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, Christian ecclesiastical provinces were named by analogy with the secular Roman province as well as certain extraterritorial formations of western world in early medieval times (see Early Middle Ages). The administrative seat of each province is an episcopal see. In hierarchical Christian churches that have dioceses, a province {{is a collection of}} those dioceses (as a basic unit of administration).|$|E
25|$|The Tempest {{has been}} called the first {{landscape}} in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> painting. The subject of this painting is unclear, but its artistic mastery is apparent. The Tempest portrays a soldier and a breast-feeding woman on either side of a stream, amid a city's rubble and an incoming storm. The multitude of symbols in The Tempest offer many interpretations, but none is wholly satisfying. Theories that the painting is about duality (city and country, male and female) have been dismissed since radiography has shown that in the earlier stages of the painting the soldier to the left was a seated female nude.|$|E
25|$|Byzantine {{architecture}} {{evolved from}} Roman architecture. Eventually, a style emerged incorporating Near East influences and the Greek cross plan for church design. In addition, brick replaced stone, classical order was less strictly observed, mosaics replaced carved decoration, and complex domes were erected. One {{of the great}} breakthroughs in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> architecture occurred when Justinian's architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan {{of the church to}} a circular dome (or domes) by means of squinches or pendentives. The prime example of early Byzantine religious architecture is the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> art, {{drawing the}} human figure from living models was {{considered}} {{the most effective way}} to develop the skill of draftsmanship. First, it is best to draw from life, rather than copying two dimensional images such as photographs. Second, an artist has a connection to drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other subject. Models for life drawing classes are usually nude. In the classroom setting, where the purpose is to learn how to draw the human form in all the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.|$|E
25|$|However {{translating}} {{efforts were}} not properly organized until Toledo was reconquered by the Christian forces in 1085. Raymond of Toledo started the first translation efforts {{at the library}} of the Cathedral of Toledo, where he led a team of translators that included Mozarabic Toledans, Jewish scholars, Madrasah teachers and monks from the Order of Cluny. They worked in the translation of many works from Arabic into Castilian, from Castilian into Latin, or directly from Arabic into Latin or Greek, and also made available important texts from Arabic and Hebrew philosophers who the Archbishop deemed important for an understanding of Aristotle. As {{a result of their}} activities, the cathedral became a translations center known as the Escuela de Traductores de Toledo (Toledo School of Translators), which was on a scale and importance not matched in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>western</b> culture.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University {{doctoral}} dissertation surveys {{the history of}} the verbal arts (grammar, logic, and rhetoric—collectively known as the trivium) from the time of Cicero down to the time of Thomas Nashe. In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the trivium to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> culture. McLuhan suggests that the Middle Ages, for instance, was characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the Renaissance was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and language. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the New Criticism of Richards and Leavis.|$|E
25|$|The space {{served as}} the home of The Darlington Memorial Library from 1936 until its recent {{conversion}} to the Humanities Center. The library was entered through a memorial vestibule and consisted of a central room with eight alcoves and contained, among other notable furnishings, a wrought iron entrance gate by Samuel Yellin. The library had been given to the University of Pittsburgh by the daughters of William McCullough Darlington and Mary Carson Darlington. The initial gift of eleven thousand volumes was made in 1918 by Mary O'Hara Darlington and Edith Darlington Ammon. This was followed by Mary O'Hara Darlington's bequest in 1925 of the remainder of the family's library and {{a large part of the}} family estate. The Darlington family's tremendous interest in historical research was the force behind the creation of what was said to be the largest private library west of the Alleghenies. The library collection is particularly rich in material pertaining to the French and Indian War and to <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley as both William and Mary Darlington researched and published in these areas. While the main focus of the collection is American history and literature, other highlights of the collection include rare maps and atlases, works on ornithology and natural history, and early travel narratives. The Darlington's son, O'Hara Darlington, also amassed a collections of Victorian literature, sporting books and works of illustrators and caricaturists. The collection has been additionally enriched over the years by the donations of other individuals and organizations, particularly enhancing its content on the history of the Western Pennsylvania region. Prior to the renovation of the original library space, these materials were digitized and placed on-line at The Darlington Digital Library. The original, sometimes fragile, materials of the library were placed in storage for availability to researchers upon request. A virtual tour of the Darlington Memorial Library as it existed previously in the Cathedral of Learning is available for the main entrance and the main room.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Willem van Gogh ( [...] ; 30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist {{painter who}} {{is among the}} most famous and {{influential}} figures in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them {{in the last two years}} of his life.

500|$|Charles Rosen in {{a chapter}} on Mendelssohn in his 1995 book The Romantic Generation both praises and criticises the composer, calling him a [...] "genius" [...] with a [...] "profound" [...] {{comprehension}} of Beethoven and [...] "the greatest child prodigy <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> music has ever known". Although Rosen feels that in his later years, without losing his craft or genius, the composer [...] "renounced... his daring", he calls Mendelssohn's relatively late Violin Concerto in E minor [...] "the most successful synthesis of the Classical concerto tradition and the Romantic virtuoso form". Rosen considers the Fugue in E minor (later included in Mendelssohn's Op. 35 for piano) a [...] "masterpiece"; {{but in the same}} paragraph calls Mendelssohn [...] "the inventor of religious kitsch in music".|$|E
