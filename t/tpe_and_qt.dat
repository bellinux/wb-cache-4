Aim : The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the relation between <b>QT</b> interval <b>and</b> T-wave variables in hypertensive patients, with and without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Materials and Methods : Fifty-nine consecutive patients with grade 2 essential hypertension were included in the study. They underwent standard 12 -lead ECG, <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> intervals: QTmax (the maximal duration of the QT interval in the 12 ECG leads), QTc (heart rate corrected QTmax), QTm (mean QT interval), QTII (the QT interval in lead DII), QTcII (heart rate corrected QTII), <b>and</b> <b>QTd</b> (<b>QT</b> dispersion); <b>and</b> T-wave variables: T 0 e (T wave duration), T 0 em (mean T 0 e), Tpe, Tpem (mean Tpem), Ta (T wave amplitude), and Tam (mean Ta) were manually assessed.

The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify whether EMR stressful Job and their prolonged exposure to work stress are associated with an increase in <b>QT</b> interval <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion. Methods: A comparative cross sectional study was conducted upon 137 EMR and a 119 matched control group composed of non-emergency workers. All study population were subjected to history taking for age, risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, and the use of medications. Measurement of blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) was recorded. Standard 12 -lead ECGs were recorded for the analysis of heart rate (HR), QT, QTc, <b>QT</b> dispersion, Tpeak <b>and</b> Tend (<b>Tpe),</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tpe</b> dispersion. In addition the levels of epinephrine and nor-epinephrine hormones in urine during the work shift were analyzed. Results: High risk EMR had a significant increase in blood pressure, urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine compared to the control group (p <  0. 05). There were no differences between studied groups as regards heart rate, QT, QTc, QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, <b>Tpe</b> interval, <b>and</b> <b>Tpe</b> dispersion with no significant correlation between catecholamine levels and QTc interval.

Interleukin (IL) - 33 is a cytokine that participates in inflammatory responses and may {{have a role in}} pleural effusions. The present study aimed to investigate the concentrations and potential differential significance of IL‑ 33 in patients with <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> MPE. IL‑ 33 levels in pleural effusion and serum samples were detected using sandwich enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay in 23 patients with <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> 21 patients with MPE. The concentration of IL‑ 33 (mean ± standard devia-tion) in the TPE patients (22. 962 ± 0. 976 ng/l) was significantly higher than that in the MPE patients (12. 603 ± 5. 153 ng/l; P 0. 05). The concentration of IL‑ 33 in the pleural effusions was positively correlated with that in the serum samples in each group (TPE: r= 0. 563, P= 0. 05; MPE: r= 0. 535, P< 0. 05). The cut‑off value of pleural IL‑ 33 for TPE was 19. 86 ng/l, which yielded a sensitivity of 0. 869, a specificity of 0. 905 and an area under the corresponding receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 903. The present study identified that the level of pleural IL‑ 33 is significantly increased in <b>TPEs</b> <b>and</b> may serve as a novel biomarker to differentiate between patients with <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> MPE...|$|R

The major phenolic compounds {{were identified as}} quercetin 3 -O-glucosyl (1 → 6) glucoside (QDG) and quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (QG). <b>TPE,</b> QG, <b>and</b> QDG from okra seeds exhibited excellent reducing power and free radical scavenging capabilities including α, α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radical. Overall, DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power of QG and QDG were {{higher than those of}} <b>TPE</b> while superoxide <b>and</b> hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of QG <b>and</b> <b>TPE</b> were higher than those of QDG. Furthermore, <b>TPE,</b> QG, <b>and</b> QDG pretreatments significantly alleviated the cytotoxicity of CCl 4 on rat hepatocytes, with attenuated lipid peroxidation, increased SOD and CAT activities, and decreased GPT and GOT activities. The protective effects of <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> QG on rat hepatocytes were stronger than those of QDG. However, the cytotoxicity of CCl 4 on rat hepatocytes was not affected by <b>TPE,</b> QG, <b>and</b> QDG posttreatments.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that in long-QT syndrome (LQT) type 1 (LQT 1), beta-blocker therapy may decrease both the diurnal maximal T-wave peak to T-wave end interval (<b>TPE)</b> <b>and</b> the maximal ratio between late and early T-wave peak amplitude (T 2 /T 1 ratio), which are electrocardiographic counterparts of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and early afterdepolarizations (EA), respectively. BackgroundVentricular repolarization duration and increased TDR and EAs are the three electrophysiological components generating the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the inherited LQT. In the most prevalent LQT 1 form of LQT, treatment with beta-blockers reduces serious arrhythmia events dramatically without a known influence on QT interval duration. In experimental LQT 1 models, beta-blockers decrease TDR and prevent EAs. MethodsWe reviewed 24 -h electrocardiographic recordings obtained {{before and during the}} treatment with beta-blockers from 24 genotyped LQT 1 patients to record maximal <b>TPE</b> intervals <b>and</b> T 2 /T 1 ratios as well as maximal <b>and</b> rate-adapted <b>QT</b> intervals using a computer-assisted program. ResultsTreatment with beta-blockers decreased the maximal diurnal T 2 /T 1 amplitude ratio from 3. 0 ± 1. 0 to 2. 2 ± 0. 6 (p = 0. 002). Beta-blockers also decreased both maximal <b>TPE</b> intervals <b>and</b> abrupt maximal <b>QT</b> intervals at heart rates higher than 85 beats/min, whereas QT intervals measured at steady-state conditions remained unchanged. ConclusionsPrevention of abrupt increases of electrocardiographic TDR, EA, and ventricular repolarization duration at elevated heart rates may explain the favorable clinical effects of beta-blockers in LQT 1...|$|R

Noninvasive evaluation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) and myocardial vulnerability may help determination of OSAS patients who are under high risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias. The aim {{of this study was to}} show the effects of OSAS on predictors of arrhythmias by the evaluation of heart rate turbulence (HRT), heart rate variability (HRV) <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dynamicity reflecting the ANS balance and myocardial vulnerability. MethodsAfter polysomnographic study, 80 patients with OSAS and 55 age matched OSAS (−) subjects were included in the study. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed in all subjects. HRT, HRV <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dynamicity parameters were calculated. ResultsTurbulence slope was significantly decreased in OSAS patients whereas turbulence onset was increased (P< 0. 001). QT/RR slopes were significantly increased for <b>QT</b> end <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> apex (P< 0. 001). In HRV analysis, autonomic balance changed in favor of sympathetic system at night in OSAS patients.

METHODS: Forty-seven elderly patients (75. 6 ± 6 years) with stable heart failure in NYHA functional classes II or III and with ejection fractions of 37 ± 6 % underwent body surface mapping to analyze P-wave <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersions. The degree of correlation between P-wave <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersions was assessed, and P-wave dispersion values in patients with QT dispersion greater than and smaller than 100 ms were compared. RESULTS: The mean values of P-wave <b>and</b> <b>QT</b> dispersions were 54 ± 14 ms and 68 ± 27 ms, respectively. The correlation between the 2 variables was R= 0. 41 (p= 0. 04). In patients with QT dispersion values > 100 ms, P-wave dispersion was significantly greater than in those with QT dispersion values < 100 ms (58 ± 16 vs 53 ± 12 ms, p= 0. 04).

40|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} (<b>TPE)</b> <b>and</b> {{second harmonic}} generation (SHG) have been studied in phenanthrene crystals at low temperatures (2 to 6 K) in order to investigate mechanisms of two-photon absorption (TPA), the relationship between <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> SHG, and polariton effects. The transition studied is of special interest because it is both one- and two-photon allowed in the dipole approximation. Consequently, polariton states and SHG {{play a role in}} the two-photon process. In the polariton model, both TPA and SHG are understood as resulting from the process of polariton fusion;Polarized TPE spectra of the 350 nm (2 ̆ 71) A(, 1) (3 ̆c [...] -) (2 ̆ 71) A(, 1) absorption system in phenanthrene crystals, recorded previously, are supplemented by further results obtained using a nitrogen laser-pumped dye laser. Analysis of vibronic structure reveals that the dominant intermediate states for TPA are those of B(, 2) (L axis) symmetry. TPE spectra principally associated with intermediate states of A(, 1) (M) symmetry exhibit strong intramolecular vibronic coupling by totally symmetric vibrations. Polarized TPE spectra of mixed crystals of phenanthrene in fluorene confirm the predominance of the long-axis mechanism in TPA and the participation of states of A(, 1) symmetry by vibronic coupling;The position of the upper Davydov component of the origin depends dramatically on photon propagation direction and polarization in both <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> SHG. The appearance of the dipole-forbidden lower Davydov component in these spectra is discussed in terms of misalignment and excitation of a longitudinal exciton. The similarity of <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> SHG spectra supports the conclusion that both result from the fundamental process of polariton fusion. The calculated polariton dispersion curve accounts for the shifts in energy of the upper component in <b>TPE</b> <b>and</b> SHG. The requirement of phase matching on the a*b face leads to creation of a polariton on the upper polariton branch, above the one-photon absorption frequency, for a*- and b-polarized light. This interpretation is further confirmed by the observation of the second harmonic generated from two beans focused on the crystal. As the angle between the beams was varied, a portion of the upper branch of the polariton dispersion curve was mapped out. The lower component polariton was reached by excitation from two beans of perpendicular polarization;(2 ̆ 7 (DAG)) USDOE Report IS-T- 962.
