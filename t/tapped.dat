40|$|The {{transporter}} proteins {{associated with}} antigen processing (<b>TAP</b> proteins) transport antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane {{where they can}} assemble with newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m) dimers. We have shown previously that <b>TAP</b> possesses a peptide-recognition site with broad specificity and that MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers physically associate with <b>TAP.</b> Here, we further characterize {{the nature of the}} peptide-binding site on <b>TAP,</b> and the site of interaction of <b>TAP</b> with MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers. <b>TAP</b> photoaffinity labeling experiments revealed that both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 are photolabeled by two distinct photopeptide analogues, suggesting that elements of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 compose the peptide-recognition site. <b>TAP</b> photolabeling analysis on transfectant cell lines that express <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 both individually and together revealed that efficient formation of the peptide-binding site occurs only when <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 are coexpressed, which correlates with the finding that peptide translocation via <b>TAP</b> occurs only in the presence of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2. These data strongly support the notion that <b>TAP</b> functions as a heterodimer. MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers were shown to associate with individual <b>TAP</b> 1 chains but were not detectable with individual <b>TAP</b> 2 chains. This result suggests that the site of interaction for MHC class I/beta 2 m dimers with <b>TAP</b> is on <b>TAP</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of <b>tap</b> is a Forming <b>Tap.</b> A forming <b>tap,</b> aka a fluteless <b>tap</b> or roll <b>tap,</b> simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting <b>taps</b> do. A forming <b>tap</b> closely resembles a cutting <b>tap</b> without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the <b>tap</b> that actually do the thread forming as the <b>tap</b> is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the <b>tap</b> does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the <b>tap</b> to clear away chips, which, in a cutting <b>tap,</b> can jam and break the <b>tap.</b> Thus thread forming is particularly suited to <b>tapping</b> blind holes, which are tougher to <b>tap</b> with a cutting <b>tap</b> due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming <b>taps</b> only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the <b>tap</b> drill size differs from that used for a cutting <b>tap</b> as shown in most <b>tap</b> drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the <b>tap.</b> Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R

40|$|The {{transporter}} {{associated with}} antigen processing (<b>TAP)</b> comprises two subunits, <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2, each containing a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region (MSR) and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). The <b>TAP</b> 1 /TAP 2 complex {{is required for}} peptide translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To understand the role of each structural unit of the <b>TAP</b> 1 /TAP 2 complex, we generated two chimeras containing <b>TAP</b> 1 MSR and <b>TAP</b> 2 NBD (T 1 MT 2 C) or <b>TAP</b> 2 MSR and <b>TAP</b> 1 NBD (T 2 MT 1 C). We show that <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 2 MT 1 C, <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 1 MT 2 C, and T 1 MT 2 C/T 2 MT 1 C complexes bind peptide with an affinity comparable to wild-type complexes. By contrast, <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 1 MT 2 C and <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 2 MT 1 C complexes, although observed, are impaired for peptide binding. Thus, the MSRs of both <b>TAP</b> 1 and <b>TAP</b> 2 are required for binding peptide. However, neither NBD contains unique determinants required for peptide binding. The NBD-switched complexes, T 1 MT 2 C/T 2 MT 1 C, <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 2 MT 1 C, and <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 1 MT 2 C, all translocate peptides, but with progressively reduced efficiencies relative to the <b>TAP</b> 1 /TAP 2 complex. These results indicate that both nucleotide binding sites are catalytically active and support an alternating catalytic sites model for the <b>TAP</b> transport cycle, similar to that proposed for P-glycoprotein. The enhanced translocation efficiency of <b>TAP</b> 1 /T 2 MT 1 C relative to <b>TAP</b> 2 /T 1 MT 2 C complexes correlates with enhanced binding of the <b>TAP</b> 1 NBD-containing constructs to ATP-agarose beads. Preferential ATP interaction with <b>TAP</b> 1, if occurring in vivo, might polarize the transport cycle such that ATP binding to <b>TAP</b> 1 initiates the cycle. However, our observations that <b>TAP</b> complexes containing two identical <b>TAP</b> NBDs can mediate translocation indicate that distinct properties of the nucleotide binding site per se are not essential for the <b>TAP</b> catalytic cycle...|$|R
