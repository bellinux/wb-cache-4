Berlin was selected as the site because Klarsfeld and her husband expected they would be punished only mildly because of the quadripartite status of the city as a French citizen.|$|E

King developed a rapid playing speed using this technique, and introduced technical elements that enabled him to produce a mix of percussive effects while still playing a bass line.|$|E

NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries <b>The</b> <b>Slap).</b> Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18-49 demographic and in second place overall.|$|E

500|$|Mrs Noye and her Gossips {{enter to}} an F sharp minor {{distortion}} of the children's tune, which reflects their mocking attitude. In Noye's song calling for the ark to be built, a flood leitmotiv derived from {{the first line of}} the opening hymn recurs as a solemn refrain. The music which accompanies the construction work heavily involves the children's orchestra, and includes recorder trills, pizzicato open strings, and the tapping of oriental temple-blocks. After the brief [...] "quarrel" [...] duet between Noye and his wife in 6/8 time, timpani-led percussion heralds the Voice of God's order to fill the ark. Bugle fanfares [...] announce the arrival of the animals, who march into the ark to a [...] "jauntily innocent" [...] tune in which Roseberry detects the spirit of Mahler; the fanfares punctuate the entire march. The birds are the last group to enter the ark, to the accompaniment of a three-part canon sung by Noye's children and their wives. In the final scene before the storm, where Noye and his family try to persuade Mrs Noye to join them in the ark in G major, the music expresses Mrs Noye's obstinacy by having her reply accompanied by a D sharp pedal which prepares for the Gossips' drinking scherzo in E minor. <b>The</b> <b>slap</b> which Mrs Noye administers when finally persuaded is accompanied by an E major fortissimo.|$|E

She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. [...] He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that <b>the</b> <b>slap</b> miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly.

500|$|RedOctane {{developed}} a new guitar controller for World Tour. [...] The unit is approximately 25% larger than previous controllers, making it closer {{to the size of}} a real guitar. [...] The new controller includes a longer whammy bar and places the Star Power button directly below the strum bar, improving the access of these features. [...] The strum bar itself was made quieter and longer. [...] The neck of the guitar is detachable, similar to the Gibson Les Paul controller for Guitar Hero III, but the connector has been hardened to avoid connection issues experienced with the previous unit. [...] The neck of the guitar features a touch-sensitive pad just toward the body end from the normal five fret buttons. [...] The player can use either the fret buttons or the touch pad to play regular notes. [...] The pad also allows the player to play notes via tapping or via [...] "tap strumming" [...] similar to <b>the</b> <b>slap</b> bass method for bass guitar, and to alter the pitch of sustained notes. [...] Guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line, (except for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, in which semi-transparent gems replace this purple line) called [...] "Slider Gems"; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the touch pad or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming. [...] The touchpad can also be used for sustained and staccato notes in the music studio feature while recording guitar, and is used for finer control over loops when recording other instruments.|$|E
