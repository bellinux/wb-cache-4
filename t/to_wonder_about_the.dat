5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News, [...] "Martin seems to address the {{helplessness}} {{of being in a}} dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape." [...] The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion: [...] "Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?" [...] The song's title also [...] "metaphorically alludes" [...] to its lyrics, [...] "pushing one <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: {{make the best of it}} when we’re here, present and alive." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Tars Tarkas {{had been}} with me, but now I was utterly alone {{in so far as}} {{friendly}} companionship was concerned.

[...] and, still chagrined by the trick that had threatened to outrage him, fell <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonder</b> woman, the Little Lady of the Big House, and how she had happened so wonderfully to be. As he fetched {{down the length of}} tank, under water, moving with leisurely strokes and with open eyes watching the shoaling bottom, it came to him {{that he did not know}} anything about her. She was Dick Forrest's wife. That was all he knew. How she had been born, how she had lived, how and where her past had been--of all this he knew nothing.|$|R
500|$|In 2008, rumours arose {{that she}} would retire, and be {{replaced}} by French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian GQ reportedly introduced Russian Vogue editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American Vogue. Condé Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn't lost her touch, the magazine had become [...] "stale and predictable," [...] as a reader had recently complained. [...] "To read Vogue {{in recent years is}} <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> peculiar fascination for the 'villa in Tuscany' story," [...] Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER.

2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E

Zero used his new powers to eliminate the monsters before facing the alien himself, now having absorbed the defeated monsters' souls. In the ensuing battle, Glacier used his life link to Pigmon as an advantage, forcing Zero to surrender until Pigmon's reassurance gave him the will to continue fighting, splitting himself into two bodies. Using Strong-Corona Zero he defeated Glacier and with Luna-Miracle Zero was able to purify the restless monsters' spirit and save Pigmon's life.

5000|$|Already at a {{very early}} age Ola Raknes was {{intensely}} occupied with religion. It was particularly the thought and the fear of Hell which these ruminations centered on. Sometime between the age of seven and eleven he began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> what <b>the</b> saved people told, that by repenting they had begot, or been allowed to take part in, a new and better life, a life which the non-repented didn't know of and could not comprehend.

He had an opaque reminiscence of once having experienced this life, in his own words from the time he was about 3 or 4 years old, [...] "when he was a church-builder". Later he considered this to have been a child's way of expressing that he had known another life before. From <b>about</b> <b>the</b> age of ten and several years onward he attempted to come in contact with this other life. He went to edifying meetings in the village, and he often attended church, although he, just like the saved people, figured that that in particular was less important because it was a lesser likelihood that a conversion would start there. It was a constant fear of ending in Hell which spurred him, because he was certain that was where he would go if he failed in finding his way to the new life.|$|R

The characters battle with inclusion and exclusion, an in-betweeness that allows them <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> their place. <b>The</b> characters struggle with the issue of social acceptance and contradiction from the hierarchy of power that, at times, accepts their culture but can dismiss it just as easily.
