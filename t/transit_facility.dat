5|$|The Great Notch train station, {{formerly}} known as Caldwell Junction, was a small New Jersey <b>Transit</b> <b>facility</b> in the Great Notch section of Little Falls, New Jersey. The station was served seven times a day, three inbound morning trains to Hoboken Terminal and four outbound evening trains from Hoboken by the Montclair-Boonton Line from Monday to Friday. Located {{at the intersection of}} Notch Road and Long Hill Road, it was the second of three stations in Little Falls, the other two being Montclair State University and Little Falls, and was the first on the line to be strictly served by diesel trains. However, most trains bypassed this station and continued on to Little Falls (westbound) and Montclair State University (eastbound). The station was served by a single track with an unused side track. The last trains stopped at the station on January 15, 2010, at 7:41pm.|$|E

40|$|Urban rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> play a {{critical}} role in citizen’s social activities (e. g., residence, work and education). Using panel data on housing prices and urban rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> for 35 Chinese cities for 2002 to 2013, this study constructs a panel data model to evaluate the effect of rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> on housing prices quantitatively. A correlation test reveals significant correlations between housing prices and rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities.</b> Empirical results demonstrate that rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> can markedly elevate real estate prices. Quantitatively, a 1 % increase in rail transit mileage improves housing prices by 0. 0233 %. The results highlight the importance of other factors (e. g., per capita GDP, land price, investment in real estate and population density) in determining housing prices. We also assess the effects of expectations of new rail transit lines on housing prices, and the results show that expectation effects are insignificant. These findings encourage Chinese policy makers to take rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> into account in achieving sustainable development of real estate markets...|$|R

Test Vehicle 1 had windows in the centre and on the driver cab, while Test Vehicle 2 is a trailer car only had a centre window and no driver's cab. The paint scheme on the lead car was orange and white, while the trailer was grey and orange. The interior of the vehicle was unfinished (no seats, incomplete floor/ceiling and plywood panelling covering wiring).

The County formed TOMTRAN to extend fixed-route bus service to Dryden, Caroline and Newark Valley in 1982, Groton (1983), Newfield and Ulysses (1985), and Lansing and Danby (1991). In 1999, TCAT initiated bus service to Enfield, the last unserved town in the County. In 1992, the City, Cornell and County built a $5 million <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> to base transit operations and fleet maintenance including GADABOUT.

25|$|Two interstate {{highways}} {{run through}} Montgomery. Interstate 65 {{is the primary}} north–south freeway through the city leading between Birmingham and Huntsville {{to the north and}} Mobile to the south. Montgomery is the southern terminus of Interstate 85, another north–south freeway (though running east–west in the city), which leads northeast to Atlanta. The major surface street thoroughfare is a loop consisting of State Route 152 in the north, U.S. Highway 231 and U.S. Highway 80 in the east, U.S. Highway 82 in the south, and U.S. Highway 31 along the west of the city. The Alabama Department of Transportation is planning the Outer Montgomery Loop to ease traffic congestion in the city. It is planned to connect Interstate 85 near Mt. Meigs to U.S. Highway 80 southwest of the city. Upon completion of the loop, it will carry the I-85 designation while the original I-85 into the city center will be redesignated I-685. Montgomery Transit (The M) provides public transportation with buses serving the city. The system has 32 buses providing an average of 4500 passenger trips daily. The M's ridership has shown steady growth since the system was revamped in 2000; the system served over 1 million passenger trips in 2007.
