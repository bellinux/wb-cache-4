He elected to bat first, and opened the batting for Sri Lanka with Sidath Wettimuny. He faced the first delivery of the match, and scored the first Test run for his country. According to a local newspaper, he was even the first Sri Lankan batsman <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> on the chest. However, he was dismissed for only 2 runs, when he was caught by David Gower off the bowling of Bob Willis.

During the Sri Lankan second innings, Warnapura made 38 runs off 155 deliveries – the second highest score in that innings. England won the match, and Warnapura's 38 would remain as his highest Test individual score.|$|E
500|$|His {{style of}} play was hard on his left knee, leading to {{injuries}} and surgeries that shortened his career. The left knee took all of the punishment and was operated on [...] "13 or 14" [...] times according to Orr. Orr was a left-hand shot who played the right side. He would race down the right wing with the puck and attempt to beat the opposing defenceman using his speed and strength. He 'protected the puck', leading with his left knee, and holding his left arm up to fend off opponents. This put him into a position where a hit by the opposing defencemen would often hit the left knee. Also, he would often end up crashing into either the opposing goalie, the net or the end boards. [...] "It was the way I played," [...] Orr has said. [...] "I liked to carry the puck {{and if you do}} that, you're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hit.</b> I wish I'd played longer, but I don't regret it." [...] Orr stated in 2008. [...] "I had a style—when you play, you play all-out. I tried to do things. I didn't want to sit back. I wanted to be involved." ...|$|E

Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> a lot and that was really hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.|$|E

While Gamburyan and Parisyan went into MMA, Rousey stuck with judo but remained in touch with MMA through them. The first MMA fight she {{took an interest in}} watching was Manny Gamburyan versus Nate Diaz in The Ultimate Fighter finale. Rousey stated she never got as excited watching judo or any other sport. After the 2008 Olympics the following year, she decided to start MMA through Team Hayastan.|$|E

2500|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was {{introduced}} to combat service only in 1941, {{with the intent of}} it replacing the Type 94 37mm anti-tank gun. It was very effective for its role, with American personnel calling it [...] "an excellent weapon, with mechanized carriage and a high muzzle-velocity" [...] that [...] "proved most effective in combat", though it was not always available in sufficient numbers. It had a high rate of fire and with AP shells was capable of perforating the front armor of the M4A6 (a slightly more heavily armored variant of the M4 medium tank) at 800 yards, though standard doctrine was to wait until tanks got closer if possible to ensure good shot placement. The weaker APHE shell, while incapable of penetrating the M4 Medium's 93mm of effective front armor, could still penetrate the tank's side (38–45mm of vertical armor), the most likely part of the tank <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hit,</b> at a distance of more than a kilometer. It was issued to armored units as well as independent anti-tank units, and was fielded {{in a wide variety of}} areas, but most notably the Philippines and Okinawa, and continued to be used with diminishing effectiveness until the end of World War II.|$|E

60|$|Raymond, coming up, {{began his}} old trick {{of trying to}} work the pitcher for a base. He was small and he {{crouched}} down until a wag in the bleachers yelled that this was no kindergarten game. Raymond was exceedingly hard to pitch to. He was always edging over the plate, trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>hit.</b> If anybody touched him in practice he would roar like a mad bull, but in a game he would cheerfully have stopped cannon-balls. He got in front of Salisbury's third pitch, and, dropping his bat, started for first base. The umpire called him back. Thereupon Raymond fouled balls and went through contortions at the plate till he was out on strikes.|$|E
