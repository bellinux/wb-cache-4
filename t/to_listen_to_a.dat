5|$|After {{the release}} of 100% Love (2011), Akkineni Nagarjuna decided to act and produce in an all-star film along with his father, actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and elder son Naga Chaitanya. Nageswara Rao {{suggested}} Nagarjuna to begin the film as early as possible, because of his age. After examining and rejecting many scripts due to a perceived lack of novelty, Nagarjuna was advised by actor Nithin's father and distributor Sudhakar Reddy <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> script by Vikram Kumar, who was directing Nithin and Nithya Menen in Ishq (2012). Although he liked the script after the first narration, he agreed {{to act in the}} film only after watching Ishq before its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> taped {{broadcast of the}} final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E
5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E

25|$|Many musicians {{have quite}} good {{relative}} pitch, {{a skill that}} can be learned through ear training. With practice, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single known pitch once (from a pitch pipe or a tuning fork) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch. Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived tonal center.|$|E

25|$|In paper 5, {{candidates}} were required <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> recording and do various tasks, but both the recording {{and the data}} file were criticised. A Halloween advertisement {{was included in the}} recording, and some candidates afterward said that they felt uneasy or thought the radio channel was switched. In the data file, Chinese slang terms were discussed in an extract from a newspaper article and in a poster promoting reading. Some teachers and students criticised the materials for promoting slang terms, some students said that they had not heard of such terms and others said that the HKEAA had misconceptions about the use of the slang terms. The Authority responded that, as is the norm, some of the materials provided were deliberately false or worthless to promote critical thinking and choice-taking by students.|$|E

25|$|BBC World Service is {{available}} by subscription to Sirius XM's satellite radio {{service in the}} United States. Its Canadian affiliate, Sirius XM Canada does the same in Canada. More than 300 public radio stations across the US carry World Service news broadcasts —mostly during the overnight and early-morning hours— over AM and FM radio, distributed by American Public Media (APM). Listeners can also call a US phonenumber <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> live stream: +1 (712) 432-6580. The BBC and Public Radio International (PRI) co-produce the programme The World with WGBH Radio Boston, and the BBC was previously involved with The Takeaway morning news programme based at WNYC in New York City. BBC World Service programming also airs as part of CBC Radio One's CBC Radio Overnight schedule in Canada.|$|E
25|$|The Nuremberg Trials {{employed}} four official languages: English, German, French, and Russian. In {{order to}} address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals {{and history of the}} interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard {{over the course of the}} proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new {{portable}} devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are {{equivalent to a}} downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. In July, XM requested that a federal judge dismiss the case. It {{should be noted that}} XM's subscribers can save only songs they hear on the radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded or program their radios to record specific artists. XM's {{portable devices}} allow the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast much like a VCR, DVR, or cassette player would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.|$|E

During the third period, all music students were invited <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> presentation given by the REME band on life as an army musician. During the fourth and fifth periods, students who played instruments such as percussion, guitar and brass were given the opportunity to play with the excellent REME soul band, along with many St Crispin's students providing vocals on the songs Valerie (Amy Winehouse/Mark Ronson version) and Lady Marmalade. A string workshop also took place during this time. Later that evening, a concert took place in the school hall, which displayed all the work that the students had done during the day. All students, members of the REME band and audience enjoyed the evening. Both the day and the evening were a huge success.|$|E
25|$|Avalon {{was formed}} in 1995 after Norman Miller of Proper Management took {{the idea of a}} vocal group to Grant Cunningham, A Director at Sparrow Records. Miller's vision was to have two male and two female vocalists who could sing tight harmonies and carry the Gospel to the world. Cunningham publicized his {{intentions}} and received many demo tapes, but nothing fit his desires. After letting the idea of Avalon rest a while, Cunningham attended an artist showcase in Nashville <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> singer. However, another artist, Michael Passons, caught his attention, and Passons {{was the first of the}} group's founding members. Soon after, former Truth vocalist and South Carolina native Janna Potter (Long) heard about Avalon's formation. Rikk Kittleman and Tabitha Fair became part of the group, but each left after a short time. Fair was offered a solo record deal, and Kittleman left for other opportunities. With two member openings, Long contacted former Truth vocalist Jody McBrayer, who became a member of Avalon a few days later. Nikki Hassman Anders was the fourth founding vocalist of Avalon. Hassman recorded two albums with Avalon, Avalon (December 26, 1996) and A Maze of Grace (December 1997), but left in May 1998 to pursue a solo career with Sony Records.|$|E
