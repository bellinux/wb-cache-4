5|$|At 18:35, {{although}} Meldrum {{believed they}} {{could at least}} hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, as well as <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> field hospital.|$|E
5|$|He went to Mary Surratt's {{boarding}} house in Washington, D.C. {{and asked her}} to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts turrets and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately {{the system}} needed two {{high-voltage}} power supplies, {{one for the}} initial acceleration in <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> <b>and</b> a second between <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reflector. And, due {{to the way it}} worked, the system was generally limited to milliwatts of power.|$|R
500|$|Field <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> their limbers were {{disguised}} as British [...] "3-tonner" [...] trucks, {{under the direction}} of Tony Ayrton and Brian Robb. They arranged for the long towing pole of the limber to overlap the trail of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> then put up a dummy truck canopy over both. The real wheels of both <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> limber added to the realism of the dummy truck, as they remained visible under the canopy, exactly where the truck's wheels ought to be. The technique was named [...] "Cannibal" [...] because <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> limber were 'eaten up' by the canopy.|$|R
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1454, {{undertaken}} {{against the background}} of another French invasion scare, shows that the 1377 system for maintaining the walls was still in operation. A town gunner had also been appointed by the 15th century, earning the highest salary of any local official and was responsible for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing gunpowder. As late as the mid-16th century, additional improved rectangular gunports, similar to those on the Device Forts along the Channel, were added to the West Gate by the quays.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} speed the {{dismantling}} of the third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> ammunition removed from the dismantled forts should be kept in storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1935. Hagglund followed up his discovery of Royal Savage {{with the discovery of}} Philadelphias remains in 1935, sitting upright on the lake bottom. He raised her that year; in addition to <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> hull, hundreds of other items were recovered from the vessel. These relics included shot, cooking utensils, tools, buttons, buckles and human bones.|$|E

5|$|On 2 September 1918 on {{the west}} bank of the River Jordan, Palestine, when his {{squadron}} was charging a strong enemy position, Ressaidar Badlu Singh realised that heavy casualties were being inflicted from a small hill occupied by machine-guns and 200 infantry. Without any hesitation he collected six other ranks and with entire disregard of danger he charged and captured the position. He was mortally wounded on the very top of the hill when capturing one of the machine-guns single handed, but all <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> infantry had surrendered to him before he died.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during {{the first months of}} 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop roads and bridges to allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> supplies were then carried overland into the hills. Only two weeks' worth of rations were assembled, however.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{officers}} and petty officers {{in charge of the}} main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.|$|E
50|$|Two {{women get}} in the car, driving it to a car wash where an employee, Ignacio, discovers <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> under <b>the</b> front seat while {{vacuuming}} the interior. He takes it {{to his home in}} the barrio, where his brother and his pregnant wife both object to its presence. One day, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> his elderly father both go missing. They search and finally realize that after the recent death of his best friend, the father is depressed and considering suicide at the grave of his late wife. After stopping him, Ignacio throws <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> bullets into a dumpster. A nearby worker sees the action, retrieves <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> sells it to an illicit gun dealer.|$|R

The bullet tore hair from Belllounds's head, but missed him. Again the rustler aimed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> wavered <b>and</b> shook. He pulled trigger. The hammer clicked upon an empty chamber. With low and gurgling cry of baffled rage Folsom dropped <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> sank face forward, slowly stretching out.|$|R
5|$|The Germans had around 5,000 {{troops in}} the {{immediate}} area of St Nazaire. The port was defended by the 280th Naval Artillery Battalion {{under the command of}} Kapitän zur See Edo Dieckmann. The battalion was composed of 28 guns of various calibres from 75mm to 280mm railway guns, all positioned to guard the coastal approaches. The heavy guns were supplemented by <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> searchlights of the 22nd Naval Flak Brigade under the command of Kapitän zur See Karl-Konrad Mecke.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
5|$|To this end, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> {{ammunition}} {{removed from}} the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and upkeep. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, this work began to slack off. As the money ran out, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E

5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} day an attack by German 88mm guns {{destroyed}} some of 10 Para's transport. The battalion counterattacked, capturing <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> a nearby farm building they were using. The brigade advance restarted at 07:00, but by now the 9th SS Panzer Division had established a blocking position between Oosterbeek and the Ede–Arnhem road across the brigade's expected route. Repeated assaults by both battalions {{could not find a}} way through. Advancing through heavy woodland, 156 Para were confronted by infantry supported by mortars, self propelled guns (SP gun) as well as fighter aircraft, and the battalion suffered heavy losses. At one stage 'A' Company penetrated the German line, but before they could dig in, all their officers were killed or wounded. Short of ammunition, the remaining men were counter-attacked by the Germans and driven back.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, {{the crew}} {{returned}} to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day. The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; {{together with the}} ship's crew, {{they went on to}} see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck. All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry Götzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the Königsberg-Abteilung (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders. The crowd had gathered {{in an attempt to}} commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to be held in the Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him. Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By this point {{it was clear that the}} governor lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.|$|E
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem proved to be <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons {{at the end of}} March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders had {{a number}} of preparatory hurdles to {{overcome}} before the battle. The men of the Rifle Brigade had, for the previous few weeks, been carrying out engineering work for II ANZAC Corps and were fatigued. The ongoing rainfall affected both the roads by which the division had to move to its starting positions and the placement of the supporting artillery. The muddy ground did not provide a stable platform for <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> howitzers. Furthermore, the artillery barrage targeting the barbed wire emplacements protecting the strongpoints on the slopes of Belluvue Spur failed to destroy them, a fact determined by scouts on 11 October. Once this information reached the brigade commanders, Braithwaite and A. E. Stewart (who took over command of the Rifle Brigade following Young's wounding), they pressed Russell for cancellation of the attack; this was refused.|$|E
