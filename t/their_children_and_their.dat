After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life including <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> nurse, Aline's cousin Gabrielle Renard. The Renoirs had three sons: Pierre Renoir (1885-1952), who became a stage and film actor; Jean Renoir (1894-1979), who became a filmmaker of note; and Claude Renoir (1901-1969), who became a ceramic artist.|$|E

After the tablets are completed, light emanates from the face of Moses {{for the rest of his}} life, causing him to wear a veil so he does not frighten people.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E

500|$|Some {{historians have}} argued the Union's failure made the Chinese {{aware of the}} need for {{political}} representation. The Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) — a communal political party campaigning for Chinese political rights — was formed soon after the Federation's formation. Others claim that the main driving force behind non-Malay involvement in Malayan politics, and their assertion of certain rights, was the increasing number of local-born non-Malays. The same report from the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies cited earlier stated that Malayan-born non-Malays [...] "have never seen the land of their origin and they claim that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children's children should have fair treatment." [...] The inaugural President of the MCA was Tan Cheng Lock, a local-born Chinese who had led the AMCJA until its breaking up.|$|E
500|$|The {{second major}} {{division}} in the church occurred over the day of worship, when Sabbatarians within the congregation wanted to worship on Saturday. [...] The practice was largely tolerated, with some parishioners attending one service, some attending another, and some attending both. [...] The elder Obadiah Holmes, however, was hostile to the practice, and was rebuked by Clarke in 1667 over his harshness towards the Sabbatarians. [...] Holmes subsequently withdrew from preaching at the Newport church, but resumed his pastoral duties there in 1671. [...] When he continued {{to be critical of}} the Sabbatarians, they finally left to form their own church in December 1671. [...] Additional dissension occurred in the church, centered on the family of Giles Slocum. [...] When Slocum's wife, Joan, denied that Christ was alive, she was excommunicated in 1673. [...] Following this, her husband, <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children's spouses all left the church, and became Quakers.|$|E

They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how to buy anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store. Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month, and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and notepaper.

2500|$|Less than a {{year after}} Jesse and Hannah were married they became the parents of their first son, whose name would become Hiram Ulysses Grant. Jesse's first born son was met with much {{expectation}} and family fanfare. Family tradition as the Grant family observed it held that the naming of a first born son was a significant undertaking and something that was given much consideration. Members among the immediate Grant and Simpson families were all hoping for their own personal favorite names for the infant son. Subsequently, several weeks after the child's birth Jesse and Hannah still had not settled on a name. After mounting inquiries from friends and neighbors about the name for the boy, members of the Grant and Simpson family finally gathered at the Simpson family home to decide on a name. The prospective names were placed in a hat, a process which Hannah expressed reservation for, deeming it uncivilized. However, {{faced with the prospect of}} returning home without a name for the baby she finally consented. Jesse and Grandmother Simpson cast ballots for Ulysses, which was taken from a novel in François Fénelon's novel, Telemachus, lent to her by Jesse, and poem. Grandfather Simpson, out of respect for an honored ancestor, also cast a ballot for Hiram. Six ballots in all were cast, where the name 'Ulysses', was drawn by Hannah's youngest sister, Anne. Wanting also to honor the Simpson family, Jesse at this time declared that his son's name would be [...] Hiram Ulysses Grant, which the infant was Christened with and became his formal and legal name. Jesse, however, would always refer to his son as Ulysses, often referring to him as [...] "my Ulysses". It is generally accepted among historians that Hannah and Jesse loved and took much pride in <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> accomplishments.|$|E

When people would ask him what he meant by these sticks, he was to tell them that God said that God would take the stick of Joseph, which was in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and put them together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick in God's hand. Ezekiel was to hold the sticks in his hand for people to see, telling them that God said that God would gather the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they had gone, bring them into their own land, and make them one nation with one king, no longer two nations with two kings. No longer would they defile themselves with idols or transgressions, but God would save them and cleanse them, so that they would be God's people, and God would be their God. David would be king over them, and they would have one shepherd and observe God's statutes. They and <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children's children forever, would dwell in the land that God had given Jacob, where their fathers had dwelt, and David would be their prince forever.

God's dwelling-place would be over them, God would be their God, and they would be God's people.
