This article explores how the interests of <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constituents</b> were shaken up and reconfigured to build support for new labor protections amidst the shifting global context of deregulation. I argue that technocratic devices-charts, questionnaires, and paragraph formatting-wielded by ILO insiders contributed to this development by creating epistemic space for this new category of employees to be recognized and for consensus to be secured on appropriate labor standards for this group.

50|$|Much of {{the labour}} laws enacted started either shortly {{before or after}} World War I.The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF were created with the Treaty of Versailles {{after the end of}} World War I as a way to bring safer working {{conditions}} for adults, institute minimum age labour limits, enhance working conditions for children, and eliminate child labour around the globe. In 1919 members of <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> consisted of countries from the League of Nations. In total 41 countries brought together <b>the</b> <b>ILO.</b> In 1926, <b>the</b> United States joined <b>the</b> <b>ILO.</b> After World War II, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> was adopted, and then funded, by the United Nations. After World War II, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> set out to change the child labour standards not just with the countries in the United Nations, but also expanded around the globe. In 1992 <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> created <b>the</b> International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) which is an organization that works exclusively on the elimination of child labour and exploitation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} two years of <b>the</b> <b>ILO’s</b> existence, 22 {{international}} labour conventions were adopted. [...] Some of the topics that the first conventions addressed were “hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age, and night work for young persons in industry.” In 1930, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> adopted <b>the</b> first future fundamental convention: the Forced Labour Convention (No.29), which prohibited all forms of forced labour unless exempted by certain conditions.With the onset of the Great Depression, the United States joined <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> in 1934 noting that complex labour issues would require an international response. [...] Throughout the history of the League of Nations, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> is <b>the</b> only League-affiliated organisation that the United States joined. With the backdrop of World War 2, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> broadened its mandate with the Declaration of Philadelphia, signed during the 26th general conference session in 1944. The Declaration of Philadelphia, which is attached to the general constitution of <b>the</b> <b>ILO,</b> foreshadows some of <b>the</b> <b>ILO’s</b> earliest future fundamental conventions including the freedom of expression and association which was adopted in 1948 as Convention 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention.|$|R

40|$|The International Labour Organisation (ILO) {{played an}} {{important}} role in developing institutions of social protection – i. e. in promoting welfare statebuilding – outside of the earlier industrialising societies of north-western Europe and North America. For most of <b>the</b> century <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> promoted its preferred model based on social insurance, even in the face of disagreement within <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> over <b>the</b> limits of contributory social insurance in societies in which formal wage employment was the exception rather than the rule. This paper examines three episodes of model-building within <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> from <b>the</b> perspective of their relevance in the global South. First, in the 1920 s and 1930 <b>s,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> grappled with <b>the</b> difficulties of extending Northern models to the global South. Secondly, in <b>the</b> 1940 <b>s,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> debated <b>the</b> appropriate mix of contributory and non-contributory provision, whilst in practice promoting the former and downplaying the latter. Thirdly, between the 1950 s and 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> grappled with <b>the</b> challenge of combining its emphasis on social insurance with more directly pro-poor policies, in contexts where workers in formal employment were rarely among the poorer sections of society. Pro-poor policies meant, in general, developmental policies, that sought to transform the rural and urban poor into workers. Throughout, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> retained a strong emphasis on social insurance, i. e. on a ‘workerist’ model of welfare. Only in the early twenty-first century did <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> begin to consider seriously and promote the possibility of expanded social assistance schemes. Whilst previous studies have identified three ‘generations’ of policy that correspond broadly to the episodes discussed in this paper, they typically underestimate the continuities between them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis aims {{to provide}} insight {{to the issue}} of {{multilateral}} organizations cooperating with private actors in order to increase their relevance in a rapidly changing world. The cases elaborated on are two issue and sector specific initiatives where the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has engaged with the tobacco and cocoa industry to combat child labor. <b>The</b> <b>ILO</b> is in need to increase their influence and reputation as it has been criticized for being a weak and irrelevant organization. At the same time as new methods for combating child labor is needed, {{the question of how to}} make global business more compatible with societal goals is gaining renewed attention. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has thus opened up new opportunities for combating child labor, and <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> has entered into these partnerships with the hope that business can contribute in eliminating this problem. However, CSR has been accused of being nothing but window dressing for TNCs trying to improve their image. Being associated with a UN agency may provide this sort of image washing, in this thesis referred to as bluewash. The thesis focus on the importance of <b>the</b> role <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> plays in these two initiatives, and whether or not <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> is able to influence and regulate the two industries involved. Using interviews of different stakeholder involved, the thesis illustrates that <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> plays an important role within the partnerships due to their knowledge, expertise and moral authority, but they are unable to regulate business to a large extent. Even though <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> may influence on the corporations CSR initiatives, as to make these more efficient, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> is in no position to question the basic structures of the industries. However, there are indirect benefits for <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> and for <b>the</b> issue of child labor in terms of increased government attention to this problem, and enhanced trade unions in the countries concerned. The thesis alleges that <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> does not bluewash the cocoa and tobacco industries CSR efforts, but that <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> should be careful in the future if funding should get involved, as the organization should not depend on private actors to achieve its goal...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{intended}} {{learning outcomes}} (ILOs) in education {{is an ongoing}} topic within distance learning and educational communities. The term "ILOs" has been introduced to indicate what learners {{will be able to}} do by the end of the course of study. Developing <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> structure, in which the subject matter and their relationships are integrated with the capabilities to be learned, is a challenge to instructional designers. In this research, <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram – a novel conceptual model of intended learning outcomes – is proposed to support not only instructional designers in designing and developing courses of study, but also learners and instructors in performing the courses' learning and teaching activities. The research covers three objectives. First, in order to pioneer courses of study which should consider all stakeholders in education, the research aims primarily to reconcile constructivist and instructivist theories in order to propose an equivalent architecture, using ILOs to support learning and teaching. Second, more significantly, the research aims to contribute a novel conceptual model of ILOs (called an ILO diagram) using a diagrammatic technique. In <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram, ILO nodes are represented as the two-dimensional classification of a performance/content matrix based on the component display theory proposed by Merrill. <b>The</b> <b>ILO</b> relationships have formulated the hierarchical structure using the cognitive hierarchy comprising six levels adopted the Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive domain. Moreover, three types of the principal relationship, two types of the composite relationship, and three relationship constraints are proposed. Finally, the third objective of the research is to experimentally ascertain how <b>the</b> structured <b>ILOs</b> format conceptualised through <b>the</b> proposed <b>ILO</b> diagram can contribute to both teaching and learning. Furthermore, the three experimental studies were conducted to explore whether providing the well-defined structure of <b>ILOs,</b> conceptualised through <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram, can facilitate teaching and learning. In the first experiment, the main aim was to investigate the instructors’ satisfaction with using <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram in teaching. The results revealed that <b>the</b> proposed <b>ILO</b> diagram met <b>the</b> instructors’ satisfactions with higher ratings for perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude towards representing <b>ILOs</b> than <b>the</b> plain-text document. The second experiment was to investigate whether using <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram to facilitate learning can support learners to indicate the learning paths. The results revealed that the mean completeness of all learning paths was statistically significantly higher with <b>the</b> structured <b>ILOs</b> (ILO diagram), showing that the learners benefited from <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram in performing their self-regulated learning. Finally, the last experiment was to investigate how well the learners understand the conceptual representation of <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram. <b>The</b> results of the experiment revealed that the average mean of understandability for the conceptual representation of <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram was higher than for both the sentential and tabular representations. These findings indicate that <b>the</b> <b>ILO</b> diagram provides more understandability than the sentential and tabular representational styles of ILOs...|$|R
