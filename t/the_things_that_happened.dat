500|$|All <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> {{were really}} inspiring, {{because it was}} {{frustrating}} ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it just makes the music that much better, because you have passion—even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. De Ferran stated that: [...] "I think first of all, I'd {{like to say that}} we're still running under {{a little bit of a}} cloud with all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in the U.S. last week and what happened to (Alex) Zanardi is still in all of our minds." [...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E

[...] Within days of the attacks, Zawahiri's name was put forward as Bin Laden's second-in-command, with reports suggesting he represented [...] "a more formidable US foe than bin Laden." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dealing with an {{intervention}} at this point, Lloyd George said, in passing, {{that he did}} not think that the First Lord was entirely responsible for all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in Norway.

2500|$|The show offers {{few details}} of the Sacred Scrolls. One {{important}} feature mentioned is the Book of Pythia, which chronicles an ancient prophetess (similar to the Oracle of Delphi named Pythia) who journeyed with the Thirteenth Tribe on their voyage to Earth. Pythia also described the exodus of the other Twelve Tribes, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to them. She describes a dying leader who would guide the tribes to salvation. President Roslin sees herself as playing {{the part of the}} leader in the texts, as she has terminal breast cancer. Another important quotation from the scrolls is the recurring phrase [...] "this is not all that we are," [...] a phrase considered the foundational statement of faith.|$|E

5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.

2500|$|On July 15, 2007, {{after the}} source's death, Novak said on Meet the Press that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton. Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton {{would never have}} been {{selected}} as McGovern's running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote: [...] "Boy, do I wish he would have let you publish his name. Then he never would have been picked as vice president. Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to him— were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton {{was one of the great}} train wrecks of all time." ...|$|E

6000|$|She kept {{a journal}} of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> {{about her in}} those eventful days, and from this we will give some extracts.

At first the Germans and Duval sought to make resistance, and several shots were fired by them. The boys and some of the Secret Service posse fired in return, and Duval was struck in the arm and one of the Germans got a bullet through his leg. Then the Germans and Duval made a rush for the sleigh in an endeavor to escape.|$|E

50|$|Initially T. semiannulatus strikes readily, but {{the venom}} is not {{dangerous}} to humans, and it tames quickly.

60|$|And now, {{that you}} may {{understand}} to <b>the</b> full <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> {{it is necessary that}} I should relate it here in its proper sequence, although that must entail my own withdrawal for a time from pages upon which too long I have intruded my own doings and thoughts and feelings.|$|R
60|$|So {{ends the}} story of the strange and evil {{experiments}} of the Invisible Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of the inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is the title of this story. The landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a sporadic rosiness of visage. Drink generously, and he will tell you generously of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to him after that time, and of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found upon him.|$|E
60|$|So {{the pair}} of them went to Sandhurst {{together}}, and together in due course were gazetted to a certain regiment of Indian cavalry, the only difference being that Godfrey passed out top and Arthur passed out bottom, although, in fact, he was much the cleverer of the two. Of the interval between these two examinations {{there is nothing that}} need be reported, for their lives and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to them were as those of hundreds of other young men. Only through all they remained the fastest of friends, so much so that by the influence of General Cubitte, as has been said, they managed to be gazetted to the same regiment.|$|E
60|$|At this I {{was about}} to break in angrily, for {{if there was one}} thing in the world I hated it was Sihamba's {{nonsense}} about birds and omens and such things, whereof, indeed, I had had enough on the previous night, when she made that lump Jan believe that he saw visions in a bowl of water. And yet I did not--for the black crow's sake. The cruel hawk had seized the swallow which I loved, and borne it away to devour it in its eyrie, and it was the crow that saved it. Well, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> among birds might happen among men, who also prey upon each other, and--but I could not bear the thought.|$|E
