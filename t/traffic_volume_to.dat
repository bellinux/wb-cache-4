The EFuNN evolving procedure leads to a similar local online error as RAN and its modifications but EFuNNs allow for meaningful rules to be extracted and inserted at any time of the operation of the system thus providing the knowledge about the problem and reflecting changes in its dynamics. In this respect, the EFuNN is a flexible, online, knowledge engineering, and statistical model. As a statistical model, EFuNN performs clustering of the input space. The EFuNN structure also reflects the data distribution of the input–output space [12].

30|$|In {{addition}} to cross-slot interference problems, the dynamic TDD {{also needs to}} consider the interference and traffic balance. For dynamic TDD, the ideal situation is to allocate uplink and downlink resources in proportion to their traffic volume. However, {{it is not enough}} to consider only the amount of traffic. If the interference is not carefully addressed, the system throughput may be seriously affected. Therefore, the uplink and downlink sub-frame reconfiguration scheme must take into account both the network traffic and network interference level to maximize the system throughput. As we know, 5 G traffic has the characteristics of burst and fluctuation with time. At the same time, 5 G traffic also has time correlation, which is stable in a certain period of time. Therefore, we should consider the unification of historical data and instantaneous data when considering <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> <b>To</b> sum up, we need to combine the traffic characteristics and the interference levels to design a reasonable dynamic TDD scheme.|$|E

40|$|The network {{structure}} {{of an urban}} transportation system has {{a significant impact on}} its traffic performance. This study uses network indicators along with several traffic performance measures including speed, trip length, travel time, and <b>traffic</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>to</b> compare a selection of seven transportation networks with a variety of structures and under different travel demand conditions. The selected {{network structure}}s are: modified linear, branch, grid, 3 -directional grid, 1 -ring web, 2 -ring web, and radial.

Results show that overall the 2 -ring web network offers the most efficient traffic performance, followed by the grid and the 1 -ring networks. A policy application {{of this study is that}} the branch, 3 -directional grid, and radial networks are mostly suited for small cities with uncongested traffic conditions. In contrast, the 2 -ring web, grid, and 1 -ring web networks are better choices for large urban areas since they offer more connectivity, thus allowing them to perform efficiently under congested traffic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Flow {{concurrency}} is {{the measure}} of the number of active flows at a given point in time at a given point in the net-work, and {{can be used as a}} complement to <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>to</b> understand the dynamics of a measured network. It is of particular interest given the spread of devices through the network which keep per-flow state. In this work, we first present a simple methodology for measuring flow concur-rency using network flow data, then apply this methodol-ogy to a long-term data archive captured at the border of a national-scale research network to measure flow concur-rency in selected example network configurations (e. g., at a content consumer network, on a content provider network, at an interconnect point). Flow concurrency is interesting in the context of capac-ity sharing efforts in two ways. First and most obviously, devices which verify and enforce policy compliance for ca-pacity sharing must keep per-flow state on either end of a flow; flow state requirements therefore dictate where such devices may be placed in the network, and the trust proper-ties of the algorithms they run. Second, as the deployment of flow-state-keeping devices in the network increases, flow state itself becomes a “congestible ” resource just as queue space is: future work in capacity sharing may consider ad-dressing this...|$|E
40|$|Since its inception, Software Defined Network (SDN) {{has made}} itself a very {{appealing}} architecture for both Data Center and Wide Area networks by offering more automated control through programmability and simplified network operations and management with its centralized control plane. However, extensive rollout of SDN {{in the production}} environment requires thorough validation. Thus, there is a compelling need for SDN emulators that facilitate experimenting with new SDN-based technologies (e. g., SDN-based routing and traffic engineering schemes). Valuable insights on these technologies can be gained from real trace-driven experiments on an emulator platform. Accordingly, network operators can gain confidence in these technologies without jeopardizing their infrastructures and businesses. Mininet, the de facto standard SDN emulator, allows users to emulate an OpenFlow-based SDN on a single server. Due to the physical resource limitations of a single machine, Mininet fails to scale with large network size and high <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> <b>To</b> address these limitations, we developed Distributed OpenFlow Testbed (DOT), a highly scalable emulator for SDN. DOT distributes the emulated network across multiple physical machines to scale with large network sizes and high traffic volumes. It also provides guaranteed compute and network resources for the emulated components (i. e., switches, hosts and links). Moreover, DOT can emulate {{a wider range of}} network services compared to other publicly available SDN emulators and simulators...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} traffic lights on traffic flow using ordinary differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE) models. I consider several different cases. First, I assume constant inflow and outflow of traffic on a single link with a traffic light at one end. This model allows the <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>to</b> increase without limit. Then, I consider cases where the link volume is limited on a single link without traffic light, a one-link system with a traffic light, and a two-link system with a traffic light.

Both ODE and PDE models {{are found to be}} able to adequately predict whether the link(s) would jam, given information on inflow and red/green light length. The ODE models provide overall information such as link volume at any time and time of jamming, while the PDE model is better at showing detailed situations at specific locations of the link(s), such as the jam length, when and where the waiting queue will be cleared and cars released can catch up with the previous line of cars. The study demonstrates that both ODE and PDE formulations can be very powerful tools in describing effects of traffic light on traffic flow, with each of them having its own distinctive merits.
