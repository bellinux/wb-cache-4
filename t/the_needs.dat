5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most {{walkable}} of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities sidewalks remain an oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need for pedestrian infrastructure is only growing as Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation place <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of cars over <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of people by widening roads or the purposeful plowing of snow onto sidewalks during winter storms.|$|E

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided for the divergent and convergent validity of its items. It {{is considered to be}} the Swiss Army knife of motivation measures: A small but versatile tool for understanding the complexity of human attitudes and behaviours...|$|R

5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust, with other landowners, attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation, whilst protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors themselves. An inevitable tension exists between <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the many {{millions of people who}} visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Canadian Pacific Railway officials, Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney {{made the decision}} to move the capital to Regina, also in present-day Saskatchewan, in June 1882.

5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} {{by members of the}} Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of exceptional circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance.
