5|$|Stevens never married, {{though there}} were rumors about his 20-year {{relationship}} (1848–1868) with his widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith (1813–1884). She was a light-skinned African-American; her husband Jacob {{and at least one}} of her sons were much darker <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1980, Shabazz was {{overseeing}} the health sciences department, {{and the college}} president decided she could {{be more effective in}} a purely administrative position <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in the classroom. She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement. In her new position, she became a booster and fund-raiser for the college. A year later, she was given tenure. In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.|$|E

5|$|Chervona Ukraina {{was raised}} on 3 November 1947, repaired, {{and used as}} a {{training}} hulk until 30 October 1950 when she became a target ship. On 10 May 1952, she was grounded on a spit {{to serve as a}} fixed target. Little is known about Krasny Kavkazs activities {{after the end of the}} war other <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> redesignated as a training ship on 13 May 1947. She was sunk as a target ship by SS-N-1 missiles on 21 November 1952.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tall. The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|Mona Lisa {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying {{a woman of}} virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; {{they are not a}} depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E

5|$|Smerch (Waterspout) {{was ordered}} on 25 June 1863 and {{construction}} began on 13 August at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 1 December. She was launched on 23 June 1864 and completed in 1865 {{at the cost of}} 554,100 rubles. The ship spent her career with the Baltic Fleet. Smerch struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast on 4 August in shallow water and sank. Using pontoons, she was refloated on 1 September and repaired. Little is known of her service other <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> extensively refitted in 1882 and 1889 which included replacement of much of the plating of her hull bottom. The ship was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and subsequently became a training ship.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{spent her}} {{remaining}} years in Auburn, tending {{to her family}} and other people in need. She worked various jobs to support her elderly parents, and took in boarders to help pay the bills. One of the people Tubman took in was a 5-foot, 11 inch tall farmer born in North Carolina named Nelson Charles Davis. He was {{a veteran of the}} 8th United States Colored Infantry, serving as a private in the unit from September 1863 to the late summer of 1865. He began working in Auburn as a bricklayer, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22 years younger <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874, and lived together as a family; Nelson died on October 14, 1888 of tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Bence filmed El tercer beso, {{directed}} by Luis César Amadori and co-starring Pedro López Lagar and Silvia Legrand. Though Bence {{was concerned about}} playing the mother of Legrand, who was only 13 years younger <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> the film was a success and she won her the Silver Condor Award for Best Actress from the Argentine Film Critics Association for the performance. The recognition led to her appearance frequently {{on the covers of}} magazines, and to an offer to appear in what would {{become one of the most}} important films in the history of Argentine cinema, La guerra gaucha. The film starred Bence and Sebastián Chiola, Ángel Magaña, Enrique Muiño, and Francisco Petrone and is set at the turn of the nineteenth century in northern Argentina. It was shot on location in Salta Province and was based on the novel of the same name by writer Leopoldo Lugones. Scriptwriters Hómero Manzi and Ulises Petit de Murat, wove the disparate stories of the characters into an overview of the gauchos' revolt against Spanish rule. The film, unlike Hollywood Westerns, neither portrayed colonization as progress, nor focused the action on the indigenous people, instead focusing on the patriotic pride of the gauchos. The film won seven awards and Bence won an award as best actress of the year from the City of Buenos Aires. It also earned her an offer from Paramount Pictures to come to the US and work in Hollywood, but she declined the offer.|$|E

25|$|Artemis, {{the ancient}} Wonder Woman seen in Wonder Woman (vol. 1) # 298-302 (Dan Mishkin, writer) (Gene Colan,artist), was a {{predecessor}} & typology of Diana, set in ancient times.

25|$|Mindy Cohn, in the E! True Hollywood Story, {{stated that}} the {{situation}} was the opposite for her. She had been losing weight during this period due to an interest in dancing, and the producers asked her to stop because much of her character's identity hinged {{on the fact that}} she was overweight. Cohn said the producers compromised with her regarding her weight by dressing her in baggy clothing to make her appear heavier <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, {{and when she did}} talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Fowler {{was born}} in Nampa, Idaho, on July 14, 1951. The {{daughter}} of a Quaker minister, {{she grew up in}} Oregon, first in Portland. Fowler was the youngest of five children in the family, with the next oldest nine years older <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> Growing up in a religious household, she did not watch TV at home until around age 10, and did not attend a movie until reaching college. From the age of two until five she wore an eye patch over her right eye and is legally blind in one eye. While in fifth grade the family moved from Portland to Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb to the west. In school she excelled in math and played the flute, while hoping to become a scientist.|$|E

His solicitor, William Clegg, tried to prove that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate terms with Peace <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ready to admit, and that Dyson had been the aggressor in a struggle in which Peace had reacted in self-defence. A number of pencilled notes had been found near the scene, which {{appeared to have been}} written by Mrs. Dyson, indicating a close relationship with Peace, though she denied having written them. (At the Coroner's inquest after the murder, she said her husband had seen them and declared them to be forgeries, possibly by Peace himself.) After the hearing, Peace was committed to take his trial at the Leeds Assizes, to begin on 4 February 1879.|$|E
25|$|Seward was {{the eldest}} of two {{surviving}} daughters of Thomas Seward (1708–1790), prebendary of Lichfield and Salisbury, and author, and his wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth Seward later had three further children (John, Jane and Elizabeth) who all died in infancy, and two stillbirths. Anna Seward mourned their loss in her poem Eyam (1788). Born in 1742 at Eyam, a small mining village in the Peak District of Derbyshire where her father was the rector, she and her sister, Sarah some sixteen months younger <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> passed nearly all their life in the relatively small area of the Peak District of Derbyshire and Lichfield, a cathedral city in the adjacent county of Staffordshire to the west, an area now corresponding to the boundary of the East Midlands and West Midlands regions.|$|E
25|$|Despite these successes, her {{brilliant}} {{career was}} fading. She lost {{tens of thousands}} in jewelry and cash in a robbery, and she had difficulties with the IRS. Her health suffered, and she worked only sporadically in the following years. In 1950–51 she wrote her autobiography His Eye Is on the Sparrow with Charles Samuels, in which she wrote candidly about her life. She explained why her age had often been misstated: her friends had to sign a paper claiming Waters was four years younger <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to get a group insurance deal; she stated that {{she was born in}} 1900. His Eye Is on the Sparrow was adapted for a stage production in which she was portrayed by Ernestine Jackson. In her second autobiography, To Me, It's Wonderful, Waters stated that she was born in 1896.|$|E
