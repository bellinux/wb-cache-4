5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which it would be filmed. Noé {{had been working on}} different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E

(The trial court found that the Intel microprocessor products were without any reasonable noninfringing use.) LGE then sued Quanta for patent infringement.|$|E

25|$|The {{major shift}} in medical {{thinking}} was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, {{of what may be}} called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.|$|E

The film was called an [...] "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" [...] by the Washington Post. His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell's horror film The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career [...] "hilarious," [...] referring to his early films as [...] "Europuddings, where {{you would have a}} French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to sell it to America." ...|$|E

For the Series, Doby hit [...]372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering {{a career in the}} MLB, Doby said, [...] "I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was going to be.

She stayed in Texarkana for six days, but {{completed}} her scenes in the first two. While filming the cornfield scene, Wells was almost attacked by a bulldog, but the crew scared it away by shooting at it. Wells {{wanted to talk to}} the real-life survivor of her role, Katie Starks, but Katie refused. The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce. During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she wanted it. Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I wanted to go on my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress. [...] "They planted a charge in the receiver, so I was standing there holding the phone, shaking, expecting the receiver to blow up in my face." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer Alan Paul {{notes that}} the band's members [...] "all profoundly felt the absence of their guiding light" [...] during the touring cycle for Eat a Peach. Dickey Betts had to {{convince}} the band members to tour, since all other members were reluctant. Despite rumors, the band did not replace Duane Allman, and simply toured as a five-piece. The Allman Brothers Band played 90 shows in 1972 {{in support of the}} record. [...] "We were playing for him and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to be closest to him," [...] said Trucks. Allman and Oakley took turns introducing songs, which was traditionally Duane's role. Betts learned Duane's slide guitar parts, but put his own spin on it. Oakley had a downward spiral following Duane's death and was significantly inebriated for many shows on the tour. [...] "He wasn't playing like he used to — instead, he'd hit maybe every fifth note," [...] recalled Allman. Occasionally, the band would have bassist Joe Dan Petty, later of Grinderswitch, cover for Oakley for the show. After nearly a year of severe depression, Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident not dissimilar from his friend's in November 1972.|$|E

Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in severalty (individually). The US declared land {{in excess of the}} registered households needs to be [...] "surplus" [...] to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers. In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the Dawes Commission to manage the land allotment policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.|$|E
2500|$|When {{principal}} photography {{began on}} March 22, 1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems. Lucas fell behind schedule {{in the first}} week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns. Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, [...] "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur." [...] Given this situation, Lucas requested for heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: [...] "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ...
