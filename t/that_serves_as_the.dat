5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A man and woman who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop through Alma. The highway starts at a partial interchange for exit123 on US127 {{in a rural area}} east of Alma. There are a few businesses adjacent to the interchange and an intersection with State Road, which provides access to another partial interchange with US127 as well as the Bus. US127 for St. Louis. Continuing westward along Lincoln Road, the landscape along the southern leg of Bus. US127 comprises farm land. Once the highway enters Alma, the street name changes to Superior Street. Bus. US127 crosses the Pine River and runs through residential neighborhoods on the eastern side of Alma before entering the downtown area. At an intersection with Wright Avenue to the east of the campus of Alma College, Bus. US127 turns northward. North of downtown, the business loop crosses another residential area before passed the hospital and more commercial properties. In Pine River Township north of the city, Bus. US127 intersects M-46 (Monroe Road). M-46 connects the Alm{{a business}} loop to the St. Louis business loop and a partial interchange with US127, while the Alma business loop continues less than half a mile (0.6km) to the partial interchange with US127 <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> business loop's northern terminus.|$|E

Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exitM2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound {{direction of the}} parkway has only one exit, exitM2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the cloverleaf, the parkway winds back to the northwest as it approaches exitM1, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Old Country Road (unsigned CR25) {{on the border between}} the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place.

5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated {{in the development of}} other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} the Halley-type comets {{suggest that they}} were {{originally}} long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> source of Halley-type comets.|$|E
