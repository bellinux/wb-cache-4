5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus {{would have been a}} selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E

5|$|This remnant (RX J0852.0-4622) {{had been}} found in front (apparently) of the larger Vela Supernova Remnant. The gamma rays from the decay of titanium-44 showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{exploded}} fairly recently (perhaps around 1200 AD), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 600 ly). If so, this is a surprising event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) twice {{attempts}} to make amends with her estranged boyfriend Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), who is still upset that she cheated on him with his best friend Puck (Mark Salling), and he officially ends their relationship. Club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) discovers that his girlfriend Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) still believes in Santa Claus, and encourages the other members to visit a Christmas grotto to help reinforce her belief. To Artie's dismay, Brittany asks the grotto's Santa to restore Artie's ability to walk, which he agrees to do. Hoping to maintain her faith, Artie convinces football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) to go to Brittany's house dressed as Santa and explain that this particular wish cannot be granted. Santa's visit is not a success, and Brittany loses her Christmas spirit, but she later finds a gift for Artie underneath her Christmas tree—a ReWalk mobility device {{that allows him to}} stand and walk with the assistance of forearm crutches—which he demonstrates for the glee club. As Brittany tells the group <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> come from Santa, Coach Beiste secretly observes the demonstration and smiles.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

25|$|As new {{information}} has become available over the years, however, the Marlovian argument about Marlowe's death has itself changed from (1) thinking that because, in their view, he later wrote {{under the name}} of Shakespeare, his death must have been faked; to (2) challenging the details of the inquest in an attempt to show <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been untrue; to (3) claiming that the circumstances surrounding it suggest that the faking is the most likely scenario, whether he went on to write Shakespeare or not.|$|E
25|$|Any device {{designed}} to represent data and perform computation, {{regardless of the}} physics principles it exploits and materials used to build it, must have two fundamental properties: distinguishability and conditional change of state, the latter implying the former.

Froude, Burke states that Pope Adrian was elected on the 3d of December 1154 and suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>having</b> taken at least a month in those days before news of the election would have arrived in England, and at least another before John of Salisbury arrived in Rome making his arrival there around March 1155.|$|R
25|$|Four metopes are preserved: Heracles {{killing the}} Amazon Antiope, the {{marriage}} of Hera and Zeus, Actaeon being torn apart by Artemis’ hunting dogs, Athena killing the giant Enceladus, and another more fragmentary one perhaps depicting Apollo and Daphne. All of them are kept in the Museo Archeologico di Palermo. Recent soundages performed inside the temple and under Temple E have revealed that it was preceded by two other sacred buildings, {{one of which was}} destroyed in 510BC. Temple E was dedicated to Hera as shown by the inscription on a votive stela but some scholars deduce <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been dedicated to Aphrodite on the basis of structural parallels.|$|E
25|$|While {{the idea}} of beta {{reduction}} seems simple enough, {{it is not an}} atomic step, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a non-trivial cost when estimating computational complexity. To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable V in the expression E, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of V in E is O(n) in the length n of E. This has led to the study of systems that use explicit substitution. Sinot's director strings offer a way of tracking the locations of free variables in expressions.|$|E
25|$|The only {{object in}} the King's Chamber is a {{rectangular}} granite sarcophagus, one corner of which is broken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which indicates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place. Unlike the fine masonry of {{the walls of the}} Chamber, the sarcophagus is roughly finished, with saw marks visible in several places. This is in contrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other pyramids of the same period. Petrie suggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on the way north from Aswan and a hurriedly made replacement was used instead.|$|E

Mary refuses to identify Elizabeth's accuser, but Elizabeth surmises accurately <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been Abigail.

25|$|The {{star that}} {{exploded}} as a supernova {{is referred to}} as the supernova's progenitor star. Two types of stars explode as supernovae: white dwarfs and massive stars. In the so-called Type Ia supernovae, gases falling onto a 'dead' white dwarf raise its mass until it nears a critical level, the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in a runaway nuclear fusion explosion that obliterates the star; in Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae, the progenitor star is a massive star whose core runs out of fuel to power its nuclear fusion reactions and collapses in on itself, releasing gravitational potential energy in a form that blows away the star's outer layers. The presence of a pulsar in the Crab Nebula means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> formed in a core-collapse supernova; Type Ia supernovae do not produce pulsars.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time after}} his appointment, Gregory Taronites {{was killed by}} the Bulgarians in an ambush near Thessalonica.

The over-eager Ashot engaged the Bulgarians and drove them back, but was drawn into a prepared ambush and encircled with his men. His father, following up with the main Byzantine force, rushed to his rescue, but was killed. The exact date of this event is unknown. The chronology of the account of John Skylitzes seems to place it in 996, while Armenian sources place it in 991. Modern research holds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> happened at the latest in mid-995, as John Chaldos is attested as doux of Thessalonica later in the same year.|$|E
