Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of <b>the</b> <b>supplement,</b> which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out if she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin.

Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted Le Soir to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the Le Soir team on 15 October, Hergé {{was involved in the}} creation of a children's supplement, Soir-Jeunesse, aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched The Adventures of Tintin with a new story, The Crab with the Golden Claws, in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the Adventures. This story, like the subsequent Adventures of Tintin published in Le Soir, would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral. Hergé also included new Quick & Flupke gags in <b>the</b> <b>supplement,</b> as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.|$|E

METHODS: Thirty hospitalized frail elderly patients tasted different formulas of a high-protein coffee supplement: -supplement C, commercial version; - supplement CA with artificial coffee flavor; - supplement CS with sucrose and - supplement CAS with sucrose and artificial coffee flavor. The preference for <b>the</b> <b>supplements</b> was analyzed by the Friedman test followed by a post hoc Tukey's test. The food intakes in each period were compared by repeated ANOVA and the food intakes of the two periods were compared using Student's t test. All measurements were made during periods of infection and convalescence. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>supplements</b> CAS and CS were significantly more appreciated than the current commercial version C (P <. 05). The patients could be classified into two groups: consumers (consuming <b>the</b> <b>supplements)</b> and nonconsumers (just tasting <b>the</b> <b>supplements).</b> Taking <b>supplements</b> can increase <b>the</b> total energy intake for consumers (P <. 01), especially during periods of infection; no modification was observed in the non-consumers.

All children had acute watery diarrhea and were given supplementation within 24 hours of admission. Daily supplementation of 20 mg zinc was given to the experimental group.

Beginning from the second day of supplementation, the frequency of watery stools in <b>the</b> <b>supplemented</b> group was significantly less than in the placebo group (p< 0. 001).
