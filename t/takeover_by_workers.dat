5000|$|Cerpa {{was born}} in the Lima working class {{district}} of La Victoria. [...] As a union leader in the 1970s he was involved in the <b>takeover</b> <b>by</b> <b>workers</b> of the Cromotex textile factory in December 1978, which was violently ended by the military government in February 1979, resulting in the deaths of several workers. Following the release of the survivors in late 1979, Cerpa organized a sit-in at the United Nations communications office in Lima.|$|E
5000|$|Gonçalves short {{tenure as}} Prime Minister of Portugal {{was marked by}} {{political}} turmoil and instability. As prime minister, Gonçalves oversaw the transition of the Portugal into a democracy known as the Processo Revolucionário Em Curso or the Ongoing Revolutionary Process. Gonçalves leadership was challenged early in March 1975 during a right wing coup d'état which ultimately failed. As prime minister, the Portuguese government nationalized all Portuguese-owned capital in the banking, insurance, petrochemical, fertilizer, tobacco, cement, and wood pulp sectors of the economy, {{as well as the}} Portuguese iron and steel company, major breweries, large shipping lines, most public transport, two of the three principal shipyards, core companies of the Companhia União Fabril (CUF) conglomerate, radio and TV networks (except that of the Roman Catholic Church), and important companies in the glass, mining, fishing, and agricultural sectors. Because of the key role of the domestic banks as holders of stock, the government indirectly acquired equity positions in hundreds of other firms. An Institute for State Participation was created to deal with the many disparate and often tiny enterprises in which the state had thus obtained a majority shareholding. Another 300 small to medium enterprises came under public management as the government [...] "intervened" [...] to rescue them from bankruptcy following their <b>takeover</b> <b>by</b> <b>workers</b> or abandonment by management. Several high-profile entrepreneurs had to leave the country due to the pro-communist radicalism of both a section of the population and the new revolutionary leadership in charge of the government - the Junta de Salvação Nacional (National Salvation Junta).|$|E

50|$|In addition, Azaña {{did little}} to reform the {{taxation}} system to shift the burden of government onto the wealthy. Also, the government continued to support the owners of industry against wildcat strikes or attempted <b>takeovers</b> <b>by</b> militant <b>workers,</b> especially the anarcho-syndicalists of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labor or CNT). Confrontation with the CNT erupted in bloody violence at Casas Viejas (now Benalup), Castilblanco, and Arnedo.|$|R
50|$|In June 1924 Witty briefly became {{involved}} in controversy when he invited the British Royal Marine band that played God Save the Queen at Les Corts, after their attempts to play the Spanish national anthem were jeered. As a result, Witty became disillusioned at the politicalisation of FC Barcelona club and, while remaining a fan, he gradually began {{to distance himself from}} the club. During the 1930s Witty and his son, Frederick Jr., established the family company as traders and helped introduce well known names such as Cadburys, Johnnie Walker, Unilever and Bovril into the Spanish market. Witty also served as President of the Barcelona Ship Agents Association until 1936 and was a leader in the Barcelona and Spanish shipping communities. During the Spanish Civil War the company was exempted from a <b>takeover</b> <b>by</b> a <b>workers</b> committee as it was technically a British-owned company and it continued to trade successfully. During the Second World War, Witty left Spain, leaving the business in hands of a lawyer. He returned during the Franco years and regained his status as a leading shipping agent. Together with his brother he also opened a successful sports shop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reorganization}} of the MFA coordinating committee in March 1975 brought into prominence a group of Marxist-oriented officers. In league with the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers-National Intersindical (Confederação Geral dos Trabalhadores Portugueses-Intersindical Nacional—CGTP-IN), the communist-dominated trade union confederation known as Intersindical prior to 1977, they sought a radical transformation of the nation's social system and political economy. This change of direction from a purely pro-democracy coup to a communist-oriented one {{became known as the}} Processo Revolucionário Em Curso (PREC). Abandoning its moderate-reformist posture, the MFA leadership set out on a course of sweeping nationalizations and land expropriations. During the balance of that year, the government nationalized all Portuguese-owned capital in the banking, insurance, petrochemical, fertilizer, tobacco, cement, and wood pulp sectors of the economy, as well as the Portuguese iron and steel company, major breweries, large shipping lines, most public transport, two of the three principal shipyards, core companies of the Companhia União Fabril (CUF) conglomerate, radio and TV networks (except that of the Roman Catholic Church), and important companies in the glass, mining, fishing, and agricultural sectors.

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Carnation Revolution, {{the change of}} {{direction}} from a purely pro-democracy coup to a communist-inspired one, {{became known as the}} Processo Revolucionário Em Curso (PREC). Abandoning its moderate-reformist posture, the revolutionaries of the Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA) leadership set out on a course of sweeping nationalizations and land expropriations.

40|$|Recent {{writers have}} {{asserted}} that firms controlled by workers are rare because workers have diverse preferences over firm policies, while investors all support wealth maximization. However, {{the source of}} the asymmetry between capital and labor remains unclear. We resolve this puzzle by arguing that because financial capital is exceptionally mobile, capital markets induce unanimity. The lower mobility of human capital implies that labor markets are monopolistically competitive and hence that unanimity cannot be expected in labor-managed firms.

40|$|In Chinas state-dominated {{financial}} system, many firms, especially non-state-owned {{or private}} organizations, face serious restrictions in {{gaining access to}} bank and equity market financing. This kind of highly discriminatory financial repression policy has induced some unique post-takeover financing activities, which {{are consistent with the}} desire to acquire firms in order to capitalize on their privileges in getting access to external finance. Specifically, <b>takeovers</b> <b>by</b> acquirers facing more serious financing obstacles (private acquirers) tend to show less salient symptoms of tunneling and display patterns of more efficient investment than <b>takeovers</b> <b>by</b> acquirers suffering less serious financing obstacles (state acquirers). Market reaction analysis suggests that these takeovers pose different implications for acquirers shareholder value, with <b>takeovers</b> <b>by</b> private acquirers being viewed as value enhancing but <b>takeovers</b> <b>by</b> state acquirers being viewed as value reducing...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{writers have}} {{asserted}} that firms controlled by workers are rare because workers have diverse preferences over firm policies, and thus suffer from high transaction costs in making collective decisions. This is contrasted with firms controlled by investors, who all support {{the goal of}} wealth maximization. However, {{the source of the}} asymmetry between capital and labor has not been clearly identified. For example, firms could attract labor inputs by selling transferable shares, and well-known unanimity theorems from the finance literature carry over to models of this kind. We resolve this puzzle by arguing that because financial capital is exceptionally mobile, capital markets are sufficiently competitive to induce unanimity. The lower mobility of human capital implies that labor markets are monopolistically competitive and hence that unanimity cannot be expected in labor-managed firms.
