5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
5|$|A quintuple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in all five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—-in a single game. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> known quintuple-doubles, both only done at the high-school level. The first was recorded by Tamika Catchings of Duncanville High School (Duncanville, Texas) with 25points, 18rebounds, 11assists, 10steals and 10blocks in 1997. The second was by Aimee Oertner of Northern Lehigh High School (Slatington, Pennsylvania), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11 blocks on January 7, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic power base may have extended widely: <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were {{at the center of a}} broad regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, {{there were}} only three Sumatran rhinos left in Malaysia, a male named Tam and two females, all in captivity. As of June 2017 <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> rhinos {{remaining}} after one of the females, Puntung, was put down due to skin cancer. If the pair do not breed, and there are no further wild sightings, the species can be considered functionally extinct in Malaysia. In Indonesia, meanwhile, a seventh rhino increased the group at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, in Way Kambas NP. A female was born on 12 May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus {{factory that}} {{produces}} refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter {{from the factory}} is exported to Jordan. The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight restaurants {{in the city and}} four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions. Today, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> soap factories still operating in the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is {{a relic of}} a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of the}} two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway.|$|E
5|$|The versus mode {{is a free}} {{fighting}} mode where multiple {{players can}} box. The number of players can range from 0–2; both fighters can be controlled by either the computer or by a player. Initially <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> playable characters; additional characters become accessible by playing through the story mode. Although the characters are grouped by their boxing weight class, any character can be selected to fight another regardless of weight class. Players can choose from ten locations for the bout. Initially, the only available arena is the Kamogawa Boxing Gym basement. New locations become available once a fight occurs there in the story mode.|$|E
5|$|The west entrance, the Gedhong Gapura Hageng was {{formerly}} {{used as the}} main entrance to the bathing complex. The east facade of the gate is still visible today, but the west facade is blocked by settlements. The construction of this gate was finished in 1691 Javanese Year (about 1765 AD). The east entrance, the Gedhong Gapura Panggung is still functioning as a gate {{and is now the}} main entrance for tourists. The east entrance is a building with four staircases, two on the west side and two on the eastside. Four nagas once decorated this gate, now <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> nagas left. The building was finished in 1684 Javanese calendar (about 1758 AD).|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> exposed {{contacts}} of Siletzia {{with the}} older (pre-Cenozoic) North American basement. One is near Roseburg, Oregon, where it is thrust against formations of the Klamath Mountains (discussed below), the other is along the Leech River Fault on {{the southern end of}} Vancouver Island, where it has pushed the pre-Cenozoic Pacific Rim formation beneath the Wrangellia Terrane). Everywhere else the contact between Siletzia {{and the rest of the}} continent is concealed under younger deposits, especially the Cascade Range volcanics. The contact around the Olympic Mountains is actually the bottom contact with the underlying oceanic sediments, tilted up by the uplift of the Olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12km of overlying deposits.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
