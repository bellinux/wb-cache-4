5|$|In September 2006, the B-52 {{became one}} of the first US {{military}} aircraft to fly using alternative fuel. It <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of Fischer-Tropsch process (FT) synthetic fuel and conventional JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines. On 15 December 2006, a B-52 <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> Edwards with the synthetic fuel powering all eight engines, the first time an air force aircraft was entirely powered by the blend. The seven-hour flight was considered a success. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, which aims to reduce crude oil usage and obtain half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. On 8 August 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully approved to use the FT blend.|$|E

5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> a standing, quadrupedal position. Using {{their long}} forelimbs for leverage, {{they would have}} vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{found himself}} {{at the heart of}} the battle for the island before the {{squadron}} arrived. On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento.

He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> the Argus fell into the water out of fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
