40|$|To {{determine}} trans {{fatty acid}} (TFA) distribution of contemporary foods, especially regarding individual <b>trans</b> <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>trans</b> C 18 : 1), 339 German foods of six categories (semi-solid fats, deep-fried potato products, bakery products, confectioneries, instant products and butter) were analysed using two GC methods. Results showed a high variation of TFA content between and within the categories containing between 0 and 40. 5 % of FAME except in butter, which {{is a source of}} natural TFA. The mean TFA values were below 2. 0 % of FAME, however, bakery products contained 4. 5 % and butter fat 3. 2 %, respectively. In addition, the distribution of individual trans C 18 : 1 differed. In samples containing ruminant fat (butter and various confectioneries), vaccenic acid (t 11 -C 18 : 1, t 11) predominated, while in foods containing industrially hydrogenated fats, elaidic acid (trans- 9, t 9 -) and t 10 -C 18 : 1 were the major trans isomers [...] This was reflected by a low t 9 /t 11 index of 0. 3 and 0. 5 in butter and ruminant fat containing confectioneries, respectively, whilst the highest index was observed in shortenings and deep-fried potato products at 5. 2 and 6. 8, respectively. In conclusion, the TFA content of foods available on the German market is generally declining, but substantial variations are present. The t 9 /t 11 index could be used as an indicator to determine ruminant fat...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} {{the amount of}} isomeric fatty acids in the diets of a segment of the American population, daily food intake was collected, using the duplicate portion method, from eight healthy white adolescent girls for 7 days. The fifty-six diets were analyzed for fatty acids by gas-liquidchromatography. The amount of <b>trans</b> isomers of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (l 8 :lt) in the diets of the eight girls ranged from 3. 5 to 8. 2 % of total fatty acids with an average of 5. 3 %. Other trans fatty acids included trans isomers of 14 : 1 and 16 : 1, and cis,trans and trans,cis isomers of 18 : 2. No measurable amounts of trans,trans octadecadienoic acid (l 8 : 2 tt) were found in the diets of the girls. The total trans fatty acid content of the diets averaged 6. 5 % of total fatty acids.

At one month of age kids were slaughtered and from each one three muscle samples were collected: longissimus dorsi (LD), caput longum triceps brachii (CLOTB) and semimembranosus (SM). Lipids of milk and meat samples were extracted and analysed for fatty acid (FA) composition. Results showed that milk fat from goats fed the SO diet was richer in vaccenic acid and rumenic acid that increased respectively more than 500 % and 600 % if compared to C diet. With SO diet, also the other <b>trans</b> isomers of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> increased, included trans- 10 C 18 : 1, while saturated and medium chain fatty acid levels decreased. The intramuscular lipid content of kids fed SO milk resulted lower than that of kids fed C milk (1. 58 g/ 100 g sample vs 1. 81 g/ 100 g sample). The FA composition of intramuscular lipids of kids fed SO milk showed higher trans C 18 : 1 and CLA isomers proportions (1. 15 vs 0. 2 and 0. 81 vs 0. 26 g/ 100 g extracted fat, respectively for vaccenic acid and rumenic acid), while lower levels of saturated FA, branched chain FA, oleic acid and n- 3 unsaturated FA (UFA) as compared to that from kids fed C milk. The ratio between cis- 9 monounsaturated FA and their tissue precursors in the Δ 9 desaturation pathway was negatively affected by the SO milk, especially for the rumenic acid/vaccenic acid pair.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the activity of individual CLA isomers—and to test cognates that are structurally related to CLA—with regard to apoB secretion. Trans- 10,cis- 12 CLA decreased apoB secretion whereas cis- 9,trans- 11, cis- 9,cis- 11, trans- 9,trans- 11, and the chloride, alcohol, or amide forms of CLA had no effect on apoB secretion. Trans- 9,cis- 12 octadecadienoic acid had no effect whereas cis- 9,cis- 12 octadecadienoic acid ({{linoleic acid}}) enhanced apoB secretion. Among 18 -carbon monounsaturated fatty acids tested, only trans- 10 <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased apoB secretion. Trans- 11, trans- 12, trans- 13, cis- 9,cis- 11, and cis- 13 <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acids</b> increased apoB secretion whereas trans- 9 and cis- 12 <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acids</b> were without effect.

40|$|Multiple {{advertising}} sexual traits {{may either}} advertise different characteristics of male condition or be redundant to reinforce reliability of signals. Research {{has focused on}} multiple visual traits. However, in animals that use different multiple additional sensory systems, such as chemoreception, different types of traits might have evolved to signal similar characteristics of a male quality using different sensory channels. We examined whether ventral coloration and chemicals in femoral gland secretions of male common wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, are affected by their health state (blood-parasite load and cell-mediated immune response). Our results indicated that less parasitized lizards had brighter and more yellowish ventral colorations and also femoral secretions with higher proportions of two esters of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, lizards with a greater immune response had more saturated coloration and secretions with higher proportions of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> methyl ester. We suggest that these signals would be reliable because only healthier males seemed able to allocate more carotenoids to coloration and presumably costly chemicals to secretions.

40|$|International audienceIn Aspergillus nidulans psi factor {{producing}} oxygenases (Ppos) {{are required}} {{for the production of}} so-called psi factors (precocious sexual inducer) - compounds that control balance between the sexual and asexual life cycle of the fungus. The genome of A. nidulans harbours three different ppo genes: ppoA, ppoB and ppoC. For all three enzymes two different heme containing domains are predicted: a fatty acid heme peroxidase/dioxygenase domain for the N-terminal region and a P 450 heme thiolate domain for the C-terminal region. While PpoA was shown to use both heme domains for its bifunctional catalytic activity (linoleic acid 8 -dioxygenation and 8 -hydroperoxide isomerisation), we found that PpoC apparently only harbours a functional heme peroxidase/dioxygenase domain. Consequently, we observed that PpoC catalyzes mainly the dioxygenation of linoleic acid (18 : 2 Δ 9 Z, 12 Z), yielding 10 -hydroperoxy linoleic acid (10 -HPODE). No isomerase activity was detected. Additionally, 10 -HPODE was converted at lower rates into 10 -keto linoleic acid (10 -KODE) and 10 -hydroxy linoleic acid (10 -HODE). In parallel, decomposition of 10 -HPODE into 10 -oxo decenoic acid (10 -ODA) and volatile C 8 alcohols that are inter alia responsible for the characteristic mushroom flavour.

40|$|Background: Several {{observational}} {{studies indicate}} that trans isomeric fatty acids may interfere with the metabolism of essential fatty acids in the human organism. Objective: The objective {{was to investigate the}} relation between trans fatty acids and long-chain polyunsaturates in mature human milk. Design: Human milk samples (n = 3 D 769) were obtained at the 6 th week of lactation from mothers participating in a birth cohort study in Germany. The fatty acid composition of the milk samples was measured by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Results: <b>trans</b> <b>Octadecenoic</b> and <b>trans</b> octadecadienoic <b>acids</b> were inversely correlated with linoleic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 32 and 9 ̆ 60. 33, P < 0. 0001 for both), -linolenic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 35 and 9 ̆ 60. 27, P < 0. 0001), arachidonic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 60 and 9 ̆ 60. 47, P < 0. 0001), and docosahexaenoic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 51 and 9 ̆ 60. 33, P < 0. 0001). In contrast, no inverse correlations were observed between trans hexadecenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Conclusions: The data obtained in the present study suggest that the availability of 18 -carbon trans isomeric fatty acids may be inversely related to the availability of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in mature human milk...|$|R

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rDNA sequences indicated that the strain belonged to the genus Sphingomonas and formed a monophyletic clade with the type strains of Sphingomonas chlorophenolica, Sphingomonas herbicidovorans and Sphingomonas yanoikuyae with sequence similarity values of 98. 1, 96. 1 and 95. 6 %, respectively. Genomic relatedness based on DNA-DNA hybridization of strain DJ 77 to these strains is 7 - 14 %. Strain DJ 77 contained ubiquinone 10 as the main respiratory quinone, and the G+C content of DNA was 63 mol%. The organism contained <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (67 %) as major cellular fatty acid. Strain DJ 77 can be readily differentiated from representative members of the genus Sphingomonas using a battery of biochemical tests. On the basis of polyphasic evidence, it is proposed that strain DJ 77, previously known as Pseudomonas sp., be reclassified in the genus Sphingomonas as Sphingomonas chungbukensis sp. nov.

Chiral phase-HPLC (CP-HPLC) {{can be used to}} separate enantiomeric hydroperoxyoctadecenoic acids. This method is based on analysis of seven <b>octadecenoic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> with double bonds at positions 6 Z to 13 Z, which were oxidized to hydroperoxides by photooxidation. A stationary phase, Reprosil Chiral NR, was found to resolve these hydroperoxy fatty acids with 1 -hydroperoxy- 2 -propene and with 3 -hydroperoxy- 1 -propene elements so that the S hydroperoxy fatty acids consistently eluted before the R stereoisomers. The chiral selector has not been disclosed, but it is described as an aromatic chiral phase with π-donor and π-acceptor groups of Pirkle type. The MS(3) spectra of the hydroperoxides showed characteristic fragments, which were influenced by the distance between the hydroperoxy and the carboxyl groups and the relative position of the double bond. <b>Octadecenoic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> can be oxidized by fungal and bacterial dioxygenases to hydroperoxides with cis or trans double bond configuration. Steric analysis of the hydroperoxy metabolites can be performed by this method, and it can also be used for preparative purposes...|$|R

The present study was carried out toinvestigate the Phytochemical, antioxidant, {{antimicrobial}} activity, determination of bioactivecomponents of ethanolic extract of aerial and underground parts of Cynodon dactylon. Tannins,Saponins, Flavonoids, Alkaloids, Proteins, Steroids and Anthraquinones were assessed for differentphytochemical test in ethanolic extract of Cynodon dactylon. The ethanolic extract shows positiveresult for tannin, saponins, proteins and steroids. In-vitro antioxidant activity of ethanolic extract ofCynodon dactylon were determined by DPPH free radical scavenging assay. The reducing power of theextract was also determined. Ascorbic acid was used as standard and positive control for both theanalysis. The ethanolic extract of Cynodon dactylon had shown very significant DPPH radicalscavenging activity compared to standard antioxidant. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of theextract was increased with increasing concentration. In DPPH free radical scavenging assay was foundto be 65 %.

40|$|The {{oil content}} and fatty acids {{profile of a}} number of Polish wild species of rose fruits were {{examined}} by GC. The total fatty acid contents ranged from 6. 5 % to 12. 9 % of dry mass in fruits. The composition of oils was similar in the investigated species. 17 components were identified. An average composition was estimated as follows: linoleic acid (44. 4 - 55. 7 %), a-linolenic acid (18. 6 - 31. 4 %), oleic acid (13. 5 - 20. 3 %), palmitic acid (2. 3 - 3. 3 %), stearic acid (1 - 2. 5 %), <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 38 - 0. 72 %), eicosenoic acid (0. 3 - 0. 7 %), eicosadienoic acid (0 - 0. 16 %), erucic acid (0. 03 - 0. 17 %) and minor fatty acids. The results indicate that rose fruits are a rich source of unsaturated fatty acids, especially in R. rubiginosa, R. rugosa and R. dumalis. There were statistically significant (p< 0. 05) differences in fatty acid compositions of some species. Fatty acids were suggested to have a potential chemotaxonomic value in this genus...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{fatty acid}} compositions were determined for 42 strains of Pseudomonas cepacia from five cystic fibrosis centers in North America. All isolates contained significant (20 %) amounts of hexadecanoic (C 16 : 0), and cis- 9 hexadecenoic (C 16 : 1 cis 9) acids and an isomer of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 18 : 1). None had hydroxy acids containing fewer than 14 carbon atoms. The quantitative {{data from the}} fatty acid analysis were highly reproducible and provided a basis for numerical analysis. Five subgroups comprising all the strains were obtained by cluster analysis and further characterized by principal-component analysis. With minor exceptions, the predominant subgroup identified in each center was different from that identified in other centers and accounted for one-half of the isolates within each center. Cellular fatty acid composition is a useful adjunct to biochemical characterization for the identification of P. cepacia isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. Numerical analysis of the fatty acid data can separate P. cepacia into subgroups, which may provide useful epidemiologic information or a basis for further analysis by more complex techniques such as DNA probe analysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOleic (cis 9 - 18 : 1), {{linoleic}} (cis 9,cis 12 - 18 : 2) and alpha-linolenic (cis 9,cis 12,cis 15 - 18 : 3) acids {{are well}} described substrates of the Delta 6 -desaturase encoded by the mammalian fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS 2) gene. In addition, at least 9 other very structurally different fatty acids {{have been shown}} to be Delta 6 - or even Delta 8 -desaturated by the FADS 2 protein. A better characterization of the substrate specificity of this enzyme is therefore needed. By using commercial cis 9 - 18 : 1 and chemically synthesized cis 12 - and cis 15 - 18 : 1 (sharing the n- 6 double bond with 18 : 2 n- 6 and the n- 3 double bond with 18 : 3 n- 3, respectively), we tried to decrypt the fatty acid structure driving the FADS 2 substrate affinity. We first showed that both recombinant and native rat FADS 2 were able to Delta 6 -desaturate not only the cis 9 - but also the cis 12 - and cis 15 - 18 : 1 isomers. Next, the inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of each 18 : 1 isomer was investigated in vitro on the Delta 6 -desaturation of a-linolenic acid. At equimolar inhibitor/substrate ratio (60 mu M), the cis 9 - 18 : 1 exhibited a significantly higher inhibition (25 %) than the cis 12 - (8 %) and cis 15 - 18 : 1 (5 %). This study shows that a single cis double bond in 12 - or 15 -position in 18 : 1 is enough to make them low Delta 6 -desaturable substrates. If a preexisting cis 9 -double bond is not absolutely required for the Delta 6 -desaturation of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acids,</b> its presence is however crucial to explain the higher enzyme affinity. Compared with oleic acid, the additional presence of a cis 12 -double bond in linoleic acid increased its inhibitory effect on the Delta 6 -desaturation of alpha-linolenic acid at low concentration (30 mu M) but not at higher concentrations (60 and 120 mu M). In this classification of the decreasing impact of the double bond when it comes closer to the methyl end of <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acids,</b> the cis 11 - 18 : 1 (cis-vaccenic acid) should be considered apart since it is itself not Delta 6 -desaturated but still a good competitive inhibitor of the a-linolenic acid 6 -desaturation.

As the temperature of growth is lowered, the proportion of unsaturated fatty <b>acids</b> (hexadecenoic and <b>octadecenoic</b> <b>acids)</b> increases. The increase in content of unsaturated acids with a decrease in temperature of growth occurs in both minimal and complex media. Cells harvested in the stationary phase contained large amounts of cyclopropane fatty acids (methylenehexadecanoic and methylene octadecanoic acids) in comparison with cells harvested during exponential growth. Cells grown in a chemostat, limited by the concentration of ammonium salts, show a much higher content of saturated fatty acids (principally palmitic acid) than do cells harvested from an exponentially-growing batch culture in the same medium. Cells grown in a chemostat, limited by the concentration of glucose, show a slightly higher content of unsaturated fatty acids than cells from the corresponding batch culture. The results do not indicate a direct relation between fatty acid composition and minimal growth temperature...|$|R
