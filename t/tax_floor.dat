40|$|An {{agreement}} about a lower bound for admissible tax rates {{can reduce the}} equilibrium tax rate (and thus welfare) in tax competition among fully symmetric countries. This is shown in an infinitely repeated game where the stage game describes the standard tax competition model with source-based taxes and symmetric countries. Repeated interaction may allow countries to sustain cooperation through implicit contracts. Lower bounds on tax rates ('minimum taxes') restrict the ability of countries to punish deviators. This makes cooperation harder to sustain. The introduction of a lower bound on feasible tax rates may thus harm all countries. tax competition, tax harmonization, minimum tax, <b>tax</b> <b>floor,</b> repeated games...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the New Economic Geography which integrates commuting costs and land rent and displays a dispersion - agglomeration configuration when regional and/or international trade are liberalised. Two main results are found, the first one is that dispersion Pareto dominates agglomeration, the second one is that the agglomeration rent is not bell-shaped but strictly decreasing when impediments to trade are removed. This {{turns out to be a}} convenient framework to revisit the links between tax competition, location of firms and trade integration. It is shown in particular that trade liberalization only leads to a race to the bottom in terms of taxation, and that a <b>tax</b> <b>floor</b> set at the level of the small country may be detrimental to it.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{tax competition}} and tax harmonization {{in the presence}} of agglomeration forces and falling trade costs. With agglomerative forces operating, industry is not indifferent to location in equilibrium, so perfectly mobile capital becomes a quasi-fixed factor. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Consequently, integration need not lead to falling tax rates, and might well be consistent with the maintenance of large welfare states. "Limit taxing" also means that that simple tax harmonization - adoption of a common tax rate - always harms at least one nation and adoption of a rate between the two unharmonised rates harms both nations. A <b>tax</b> <b>floor</b> set at the lowest equilibrium tax rate leads to a weak Pareto improvement.

40|$|Introduction In October 2015, tobacco {{corporations}} arranged “price wars” in Ukraine by decreasing maximum retail cigarette prices, while specific excise {{was increased}} by 40 % since January 2016. In Moldova, the industry decreased prices of some brands by 20 - 30 % in December 2014, when government presented {{plans to increase}} excises. We estimate price wars' impact on tobacco consumption and revenue. Material and Methods Monthly data on cigarette prices, excise revenues, and cigarette sales were collected and analyzed. Results In October 2015 –February 2016, average cigarette prices in Ukraine decreased by 11 %. For some brands, total tax exceeded the price. Despite increased excise, price wars made cigarettes cheaper, consequently, their sales increased. Price wars were beneficial for the governmental excise revenue because Ukraine applies an excise system with a minimum specific <b>tax</b> <b>floor.</b> In 2016, tobacco excise revenue was 49 % higher than in same period of 2015, while excise rate increased by 40 %. In Moldova, {{in the first quarter}} of 2015 average cigarette prices decreased by 9 % and the excise revenue declined by 35 %. The government of Moldova planned to increase both specific and ad valorem rates, but after the “price war” it increased the specific rate but decreased ad valorem rate. Conclusions The tobacco industry uses “price wars” to keep customers and to press governments to adopt profitable excise rates. Tobacco companies can set price wars as they have right to determine maximum retail selling prices. If a country uses “maximum retail prices” to calculate ad valorem excise, regulations should prohibit downward changes of such prices...|$|E
