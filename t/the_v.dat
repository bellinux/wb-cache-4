5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as <b>the</b> <b>V</b> Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, though they served in this capacity for a very short time.

Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties.

5|$|As the Union army approached, Lee {{chose to}} make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam. <b>The</b> <b>V</b> Corps was held in reserve {{in the center of}} Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place {{over the course of the}} day. <b>The</b> <b>V</b> Corps, however, took no part in these assaults.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} pancreatic elasticity and tumor diagnosis, we preoperatively {{investigated the}} elasticity calculated {{by a new}} ultrasonography (US) technique, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI). Materials and Methods: We examined ARFI in non-tumorous and tumor regions by push pulse of probe in 30 patients with pancreatic malignancies undergoing pancreatectomy. Measurement of stiffness was indicated as <b>the</b> <b>Vs</b> (mm/sec). Results: <b>The</b> <b>Vs</b> in <b>the</b> non-tumor region was measured in the pancreas head in 17 and in the body in 13 patients. <b>The</b> <b>Vs</b> of pancreatic tumors was measured in 14 of 22 patients (64 %). <b>The</b> <b>Vs</b> in pancreatic tumors (2. 17 ± 0. 95 m/sec.) {{was significantly higher than}} that in the non-tumorous pancreas (1. 41 ± 0. 47 m/sec.) (p< 0. 01). <b>The</b> <b>Vs</b> of <b>the</b> non-pancreatic regions in the pancreas head and body were not significantly different. <b>The</b> <b>Vs</b> of <b>the</b> non-tumorous pancreas was not associated with patient demographics, laboratory data, the hardness of the pancreatic tissue, or postoperative morbidity. <b>The</b> <b>Vs</b> of <b>the</b> resected pancreatic tumors was not associated with any tumor-related parameters. Conclusions: ARFI imaging elastography can be used to evaluate pancreatic malignant tumor lesion in comparison with the non-tumor lesion...|$|R

Thus, when the first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to the Bomber Command Armaments School at RAF Wittering on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them.
