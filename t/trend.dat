5|$|A slow {{weakening}} <b>trend</b> began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. The weakening <b>trend</b> remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. The weakening <b>trend</b> accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. The weakening <b>trend</b> slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E

The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)).

40|$|Lifestyle and {{consumer}} <b>trends</b> {{are part of}} people’s everyday lives everywhere. <b>Trends</b> in media and politics, though perhaps less frequently acknowledged as <b>trends,</b> shape the way societies are perceived and the way humans interact. Moreover, although we may think of <b>trends</b> as a recent phenomenon of post-war globalization, <b>trends</b> have been crucial in societies across the globe for much longer. In short, <b>trends</b> matter. Yet, despite their crucial role worldwide, <b>trends</b> {{have been subject to}} fairly little research beyond the quantitative social sciences. This is especially true for transcultural <b>trends.</b> This essay prefaces a series of upcoming articles in this journal all of which discuss case studies of <b>trends</b> that travelled from Europe to Asia or from Asia to Europe since the late 19 th century to our current times. Why <b>trends</b> travel, who proliferates or obstructs <b>trends,</b> and how <b>trends</b> become popular are questions that are collectively addressed in all upcoming articles.

Negative <b>trends</b> include those involving issues of Internet related privacy; ubiquitous society and control; <b>trends</b> in Internet related media being censored; <b>trends</b> in filtering and blocking Internet content and blocking software; <b>trends</b> in technologies to monitor and identify citizens using the Internet to express their opinion and applying 'freedom of speech'; criminalization of legitimate expression on the Internet; <b>trends</b> in acts, regulations and legislation {{regarding the use of}} the Internet and <b>trends</b> in government models regarding Internet censorship; <b>trends</b> in new forms of Internet censorship; <b>trends</b> in support of Internet censorship; <b>trends</b> in enforcing regulations and Internet censorship; <b>trends</b> in Internet related communication surveillance.

40|$|Antarctic sea ice is {{experiencing}} a weak overall increase in area that is the residual of opposing regional <b>trends.</b> This study considers their seasonal pattern. In addition to traditional ice concentration and total ice area, temporal derivatives of these quantities are investigated (‘intensification’ and ‘expansion’ respectively). This {{is crucial to the}} attribution of <b>trends,</b> since changes in forcing directly affect ice areal change (rather than ice area). Diverse regional <b>trends</b> all contribute significantly to the overall increase. <b>Trends</b> in the Weddell and Amundsen—Bellingshausen regions compensate in magnitude and seasonality. The largest concentration <b>trends,</b> in autumn, are actually caused by intensification <b>trends</b> during spring. Autumn intensification <b>trends</b> directly oppose autumn concentration <b>trends</b> in most places, seemingly as a result of ice and ocean feedbacks.
