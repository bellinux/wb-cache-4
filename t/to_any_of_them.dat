5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another ideology-focused {{approach}} defines {{both parties}} not as competing trends within Carlism, but as entirely separate political groupings which between 1870 and 1888 remained in a temporary, shaky alliance. According to this analysis, the religion-focused group {{has always been}} clearly distinct from Carlism. In partisan version, launched in the 1970s {{for the sake of}} political struggle, Traditionalists infiltrated into Carlism. Later this theory was elaborated further on and currently features 3 groupings: Integrists focusing on religious aims, Traditionalists focusing on dynastical aims and (genuine) Carlists focusing on social aims. Recently when discussing the 1888 rupture historians tend to combine all factors mentioned, without giving priority <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{his policy}} speech upon {{receiving}} the premiership, Maga asked his fellow Dahomeyans {{to end the}} tribalism that had characterised his country's politics. He appealed for unity among Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin supporters and encouraged investments into the economy. Foreign affairs dominated Maga's first months in office, but at home the desire for an independent Dahomey was mounting. Apithy announced on September 2, 1959, that he would remove all P.R.D. deputies from the government if Maga did not establish referendums on Dahomey's political status. Maga reacted by dismissing Apithy from his cabinet on September 18, and warning P.R.D. deputies that the same would happen <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> who opposed him on the matter.|$|E

25|$|With {{the partial}} {{exception}} of Holbein, van Dyck and his exact contemporary Diego Velázquez {{were the first}} painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as Court portraitists. The slightly younger Rembrandt was also to work mainly as a portraitist for a period. In the contemporary theory of the hierarchy of genres portrait-painting came well below history painting (which covered religious scenes also), and for most major painters portraits were a relatively small part of their output, {{in terms of the}} time spent on them (being small, they might be numerous in absolute terms). Rubens for example mostly painted portraits only of his immediate circle, but though he worked for most of the courts of Europe, he avoided exclusive attachment <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Yuma senses though that there might be trouble between her and Fujiwara despite Hotaru's strong attitude.

Hotaru eventually gets surprised by Yuma's bolder moves which makes her happy yet for some reason also in pain.|$|E

25|$|Veeck {{once again}} came to Paige's rescue when, after {{taking control of}} the Phillies' triple-A farm team, the Miami Marlins of the International League, he signed Paige to a {{contract}} for $15,000 and a percentage of the gate. Marlins manager Don Osborn did not want Paige and said that he would only use him in exhibition games. Veeck made a deal with Osborn that he could line up his best nine hitters, rotating them in from their positions in the field, and Veeck agreed to pay ten dollars <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> who get a clean hit off of Paige. Paige retired all nine and Osborn agreed to make Paige a roster player. In Paige's first game as a Marlin, he pitched a complete-game, four-hit shutout. Osborn, a former minor league pitcher, taught Paige the proper way to throw a curveball, which allowed Paige to tear through the International League. Paige finished the season 11–4 with an ERA of 1.86 with 79 strikeouts and only 28 walks. This time, when Veeck left the team, Paige was allowed to stay on, for two more years.|$|E

Jacobson said he, too, liked [...] "good looking young guys (in their late teens and early 20's) doing their thing together". Neither Jacobson nor Comfort made any more explicit reference to pornographic materials and Jacobson stopped writing back after two letters.

[...] The court added in Civil Rights Cases (1883): [...] "It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not {{the subject matter of the}} amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all State legislation, and State action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or which denies <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> the equal protection of the laws." ...|$|E

[...] Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment; the Supreme Court held in the [...] Civil Rights Cases (1883) that {{the amendment}} was limited to [...] "state action" [...] and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations (though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via {{other parts of the}} Constitution). U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Bradley commented in the Civil Rights Cases that [...] "individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [...] Amendment.

Patrick Gann of RPGFan, on the other hand, said that besides the cinematics and character portraits the graphics were not impressive, with poor sprites and animation. The plot was not as highly received; while Bozon called it a [...] "pretty involving piece of Mana mythos", VanOrd said only {{that it was not}} [...] "particularly engaging, but it's pleasant enough", while Parkin called the story [...] "lingering intrusions" [...] and Gann found it well written, but too linear and cliched.
