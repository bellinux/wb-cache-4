5|$|The Japanese manga Fullmetal Alchemist {{was written}} and {{illustrated}} by Hiromu Arakawa. It has been serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Shōnen Gangan since its August 2001 issue (published on July 12, 2001) and concluded on its July 2010 issue (published in June 2010) with a total of 108 chapters. The plot follows the adventures of two alchemist brothers named Edward and Alphonse Elric. They are striving to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone so that they may recover parts of their bodies that they lost in an attempt to bring their mother back to life. Therefore, Edward joins the state military and discovers that several members of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> also attempting to get the stone.|$|E

50|$|At {{first it}} seemed <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> moving {{to take over}} the {{government}} between January 11-13, with unusual troop and naval deployments around <b>the</b> capital. <b>Military</b> establishments <b>were</b> barricaded and rumours spread that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> preparing to seize power. Rumours also swept the capital that <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, had been arrested by the police on government orders, but <b>the</b> <b>military</b> denied this.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} death {{notification}} in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> a three phase process. The people doing the notifying <b>are</b> also in <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> and <b>are</b> {{usually in a}} four-member team.|$|R
25|$|I {{requested}} him to {{send the}} army to Gujarat and suppress <b>the</b> riots. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> sent, {{but they were not}} given powers to shoot. If <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> given powers to shoot at the perpetrators of violence, recurrence of tragedies in Gujarat could have been avoided.|$|R
25|$|Dedicated {{psychological}} operations units {{exist in the}} United States Army. The United States Navy also plans and executes limited PSYOP missions. United States PSYOP units and soldiers of all branches of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> prohibited by law from targeting U.S. citizens with PSYOP within {{the borders of the}} United States (Executive Order S-1233, DOD Directive S-3321.1, and National Security Decision Directive 130). While United States Army PSYOP units may offer non-PSYOP support to domestic military missions, they can only target foreign audiences.|$|E
25|$|Non-Muslims {{would also}} have to pay a {{traditional}} special tax known as jizya. Under Maududi's Islamic state, this tax would be applicable to all able-bodied non-Muslim men—elderly, children and women being exempt—in return from their exemption from military service, (which all adult Muslim men would be subject to). Those who serve in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> exempted. Non-Muslims would also be barred from holding certain high level offices in the Islamic state. Jizya is thus seen as a tax paid in return for protection from foreign invasion, but also as a symbol of Islamic sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Press {{accounts}} in January 2016 indicated that Department of Defense staff were reviewing Department of Justice {{documents from the}} Petraeus prosecution and considering whether to recommend to the Secretary of Defense that Petraeus be demoted on the Army's retired list. Laws and regulations indicate that members of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> retired at the last rank {{in which they are}} deemed to have served successfully; Petraeus' admission of an extramarital affair and guilty plea with regard to removing and retaining classified information while serving in the grade of General could be grounds for reduction in rank to Lieutenant General. The matter was reviewed by then-Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh before he left office in October 2015; he recommended no further action. On January 29, press {{accounts in}}dicated that Stephen C. Hedger, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, had written to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. In his letter, Hedger informed the committee that Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had concurred with the Army's recommendation, and would not impose any further punishment on Petraeus.|$|E

500|$|The {{setting of}} the book has been {{described}} as dystopian. However, it is presented by Heinlein as utopian; its leaders are shown as good and wise, and the population as free and prosperous. Slusser wrote in 1987 that Starship Troopers depicts a world that is [...] "hell for human beings", but nonetheless celebrates the ideology of its fictional society. The rulers are claimed to be the best in history, because they understand that human nature is to fight for power through the use of force. The suggestion of utopia is not explored in depth, as the lives of those outside <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> not shown in any detail. The novel suggests that the militarist philosophy espoused by many of the characters has a mathematical backing, though reviewers have commented that Heinlein does not present any basis for this.|$|E
500|$|Decay {{begins with}} Gina Cross and Colette Green {{arriving}} at the Anomalous Materials Labs at Black Mesa and reporting to Dr. Keller, who is readying the day's analysis of an unknown specimen. Despite the objections of Dr. Rosenberg to pushing the analysis equipment beyond its design capacities, Cross and Green are assigned to assist setting up the experiment for Gordon Freeman. When Freeman inserts the specimen into the scanning beam, however, it triggers a [...] "resonance cascade", causing massive damage to the facility and teleporting alien creatures into the base. Keller and Rosenberg agree that Black Mesa cannot {{deal with the situation}} on its own, and so decide to call for military assistance. Cross and Green escort Rosenberg to the surface, where he sends a distress signal to the military. However, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> ordered not only to contain the situation, but to silence the base by killing its employees. Rosenberg elects to stay behind to meet with the military on arrival and Cross and Green return to Keller.|$|E

[...] a major problem [...] People at the highest levels of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> involved in the facilitation [...] In other African countries government officials are part of the problem. In Guinea-Bissau, it is the government itself that is the problem." [...] A sentiment echoed by regional UN staff. The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre Lapaque also said: [...] "There has clearly been an increase in Guinea-Bissau in the last several months. We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country;" [...] while the EU's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez-Ducay added: [...] "As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d’état. They can do what they want to do. Now they have free rein." ...|$|E

500|$|While Petre Dumitriu is {{motivated}} by his pursuit of discipline, his wife preserves her sophistication, reading the works of Marcel Proust, playing the harpsichord, employing a nanny to educate her children, and comparing the surrounding landscape with Japan's Mount Fuji. Variety calls her [...] "sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of Zelda Fitzgerald". To her husband's assurance {{that they were not}} going to spend long in Southern Dobruja, she replies: [...] "I like it here." [...] In pursuing this path, she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters. This rift is made apparent by a number of omens: unknown attackers throw rocks into the Dumitrius' house, while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable. Confronted with these signs, Von Debretsy still attempts to make the best of the situation; online film critic James Berardinelli notes: [...] " [...] does her best to make a happy home for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors." [...] Bulgarian locals, taken as hostages by <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> <b>are</b> made to work on the garden. Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop, and, upset by their condition, Marie-Thérèse decides to pay them out of her own pocket, serves them tea and eventually befriends them. In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu's book chapter ("The Salad"), she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner, and they are all shown to be enjoying the salad provided by Bulgarian labor. However, the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host, when she expresses her appreciation of her servants' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf.|$|E

50|$|Reacting to {{statements}} from Military Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama that whatever amendments might <b>be</b> forthcoming, <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>was</b> still {{opposed to the}} legislation, Bale declared on 26 October that <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>was</b> entitled to its opinion, {{but it was not}} the government. The government and not <b>the</b> <b>Military,</b> he said, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> final arbiter on the bill.

50|$|Captain Neumi Leweni, the Army's Media Liaison Officer, said on 4 October that <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> had {{principles}} to uphold, and therefore {{there would be}} no compromise on the Unity Bill.

2500|$|After Bender destroys {{nearly all}} of Central Park while playing with Fry, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> sent to deal with him. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> unable to damage Bender with their {{electric}} weapons, and Bender continues to wreak havoc upon New New York. To combat Bender, the Professor uses his enlarging-ray on Zoidberg, only to see him wreak havoc as well. Zoidberg is interrupted by Bender who is not pleased with Zoidberg destroying [...] "his" [...] city. The two fight, with their battle causing massive damage. Bender fills Shea Stadium with boiling water and pushes Zoidberg into it. An enraged and boiled Zoidberg rises {{out of the water}} and snaps off Bender's feet, causing him to fall over and impale himself on the Empire State Building. A tearful Fry admonishes the citizens of New New York about the tragedy of Bender, whose final words lament his inability to fulfill his dream to kill all humans. Bender dies, and the scenario ends as onlookers silently watch on.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of the attack in remote northeastern Borno State, much of which is occupied by Boko Haram, as well as [...] "the routine nature of Nigeria's violence may have diminished" [...] perceptions of the massacre's newsworthiness. Experts have noted that media has been suppressed in Borno State, where witnesses with information frequently lack contacts with the media, and statements by <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>are</b> unreliable. The Nigerian press was also seen as not adequately covering the attacks in Baga. [...] One expert stated: [...] "Local media caught on to the story only after the BBC's coverage.

But because the Savior lives, we do not use the symbol of His death as the symbol of our faith," [...] and therefore [...] "The only members of the Church who wear {{the symbol of the}} cross are Latter-day Saint chaplains, who wear it on their military uniforms to show that they are Christian chaplains."
