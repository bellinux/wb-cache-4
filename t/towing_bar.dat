5000|$|Orbiter Tow Vehicle. This unit is {{very much}} like the typical towing units used for large aircraft. However, it was {{equipped}} with a special <b>towing</b> <b>bar</b> designed specifically for the orbiter. It was used to move the orbiter from the landing facility to the OPF. It also is used for moving the orbiter from the OPF to the VAB.|$|E
50|$|The mortar {{consists}} of a smooth-bored barrel with a breech and a breech-block frame, a frame with shock absorbers, mount with training and equilibrating mechanisms, a two-wheel traveling carriage with the suspension, a boom for changing from the firing to the traveling configuration, a baseplate and a <b>towing</b> <b>bar</b> with a lunette. The sights are carried separately and are mounted on the mortar only when firing. The shock absorbers are used to protect the sights from firing vibrations and also provide {{the link between the}} ordnance and the mount. It is also used when the mounting returns to the loading position after firing. The boom provides stability when firing and also has two winches to convert the mortar from the firing to the traveling configuration.|$|E
25|$|Messerschmitt, and {{subsequently}} FMR, made factory-converted Service Cars to {{order for the}} automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> {{to the front of}} the Service Car, clamp the other end of the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's car, and drive back to the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.|$|R

50|$|Very small {{airplanes}} may {{be moved}} by human power alone. The airplane may be pushed or pulled by landing gear, wing struts, or even the propeller blades, since they're known to {{be strong enough to}} drag the airplane through the air. To allow for turns, a person may either pick up or push down on the tail to raise either the nose wheel or tail wheel off the ground, then rotate the airplane by hand. A less cumbersome method involves attaching a short <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> to either the nose wheel or tail wheel, which provides a solid handhold and leverage to steer with, as well as eliminates the danger of handling the propeller. These <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> are usually a lightweight aluminum alloy construction which allows them to be carried on board the airplane. Other small <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> have a powered wheel to help move the airplane, with power sources as diverse as lawnmower engines or battery-operated electric drills. However, powered <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> are usually too large and heavy to be practically carried on small airplanes.|$|R
50|$|Conventional tugs use a <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> {{to connect}} the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> is fixed {{laterally}} at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the towbar also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized tow pin on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> for large aircraft the towbar rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a hydraulic jacking mechanism which can lift the towbar to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> can be connected at the front or {{the rear of the}} tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The towbar has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the bar from the nose gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug.Towbarless tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground, allowing the tug to maneuver the aircraft. This allows better control of the aircraft and higher speeds; it may also eliminate the need to have a worker in the cockpit to apply the aircraft's brakes. The main advantage of a towbarless tug is simplicity; {{there is no need to}} maintain multiple towbars. The physical action and coordination required by the tug operator to move an aircraft with a TBL tug is simpler and easier to learn than with a tug and towbar. By connecting the tug directly to the aircraft's landing gear tug operators have better control and responsiveness when maneuvering. This is most advantageous in general aviation settings where operators are often required to move more types of aircraft more often into more confined spaces than their airline counterparts.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of tow hitch, {{including}} a ball hitch, <b>tow</b> <b>bar,</b> pintle and lunette ring, three-point, fifth wheel, coupling, and drawbar, among others.|$|R

40|$|The {{automotive}} domain {{is currently}} moving towards automated driver assistance applications, like automatic evasive maneuvers to avoid accidents, and even beyond assistance towards automated driving. However, {{in the near}} future these systems will only be active under certain conditions, thus still requiring manual control in other conditions. This means that there will be ‘transitions of control’: from the driver to the automated system and vice versa. Then research questions like ‘how should the system take over’, ‘how can the driver take back control’, and ‘can the driver be regarded as a backup if the system fails’, etc. arise. This paper addresses the effects of various parameters in handing back the control to the driver. This is done for TNO’s virtual <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> system, which is an automated driving system that controls both the longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion at very close following for economic driving. This paper presents results of a driving simulator experiment executed with the aim to evaluate different parameters settings in switching the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> system on and off. Due to the short following distances and safety implications of this, there is be a procedure for hooking on / off of the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> system. Special attention is paid to driver behavior just after getting back control following a period of automated driving...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, yard ramps {{normally}} {{incorporate a}} <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> or ramp clamp {{allowing them to}} be quickly and easily moved around on site by forklift {{and placed in a}} new location as required. Their mobile design makes them ideal for small sites where space is a premium, or sites with rapidly changing operations/requirements.|$|R

50|$|A {{tow hitch}} (or <b>tow</b> <b>bar)</b> is a device {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|The Servi-Car was {{designed}} during the Great Depression when Harley-Davidson {{was desperate to}} expand its product base to increase sales.
