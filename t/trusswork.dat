50|$|The <b>trusswork</b> was {{sufficiently}} completed on January 1, 1805, {{to permit the}} bridge to be opened to traffic. But {{the president of the}} bridge company asked Palmer if the bridge wouldn't last longer if it was protected from the wind and rain by a weatherproof covering. Palmer said that the bridge's life span might be increased from ten-twelve years to thirty-forty years if a roof and sidewalls were added. Thus was created the first covered bridge in America.|$|E
50|$|Discussions {{into the}} {{building}} of the bridge began in the late 1860s and it was decided that the bridge would be a long-span wrought-iron-truss. The design of the bridge was handled by Jacob Linville, president of the Keystone Bridge Co., which manufactured its trusses. The bridge was completed in 1871. The approaches are made of cut sandstone blocks that elevate the rail line to the recommended height. The bridge itself consists of all wrought-iron <b>trusswork</b> resting on six cut stone piers sunk into the river bed.|$|E

50|$|Although some {{continuous}} truss bridges resemble cantilever {{bridges and}} may be constructed using cantilever techniques, there are important {{differences between the two}} forms. Cantilever bridges need not connect rigidly mid-span, as the cantilever arms are self-supporting. Although some cantilever bridges appear continuous due to decorative <b>trusswork</b> at the joints, these bridges will remain standing if the connections between the cantilevers are broken, or if the suspended span (if any) is removed. Conversely, continuous truss bridges rely on rigid truss connections throughout the structure for stability. Severing a continuous truss mid-span endangers the structure. However, continuous truss bridges do not experience the tipping forces that a cantilever bridge must resist, because the main span of a continuous truss bridge is supported at both ends.|$|E
50|$|The brick {{tower was}} not {{structurally}} sound, and in 1892 it was strengthened. This {{continued to be}} unsatisfactory, and in 1894 a plan was conceived to replace the existing tower with a skeletal tower taken from the old Chicago Harbor Light, which was erected in 1859 and dismantled when its replacement constructed. This tower had to be increased in height by adding two stages of <b>trusswork</b> to its base; a new service room was also inserted below the lantern. The new light received the lens from the old light and was first lit on November 20, 1894. The old tower remained standing until the next year, when it was dismantled down {{to the level of}} roof of the keeper's dwelling; at the same time, the latter was extended to encompass the stubby remains of the old tower.|$|E

The lower wing was mounted {{to the top of}} the aircraft's hull, with <b>trusswork</b> above it that carried three engines mounted tractor-fashion in the interplane gap. The lower wing also carried outrigger pontoons near its tips. The empennage was of conventional design, with the stabilizer carried part-way up the fin. The flight deck was open but the separate cabin, with seating for six passengers, was fully enclosed within the hull and electrically heated. The structure was of timber throughout except for the struts that carried the engines, which were steel tube. The wings were covered in fabric.|$|E
5000|$|In 1942 he {{was told}} that {{helicopters}} were going to be the [...] "next big thing" [...] by the former head of Ford Trimotor production, Bill Stout. He called Sikorsky Aircraft to inquire about possible work, and soon got a contract to build the wooden stringers in the rotor blades. At the time, rotor blades (rotary wings) were built in the same fashion that fixed wings were, consisting of a long tubular steel spar with stringers (or more accurately ribs) set on them to provide the aerodynamic shape that was then covered with a stressed skin. The stringers for the rotors were built from a design provided by Sikorsky, which was sent to Parsons as a series of 17 points defining the outline. Parsons then had to [...] "fill in" [...] the dots with a French curve to generate an outline. A wooden jig was built up to form the outside of the outline, and the pieces of wood forming the stringer were placed under pressure against the inside of the jig so they formed the proper curve. A series of <b>trusswork</b> members were then assembled inside this outline to provide strength.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collapse}} {{was caused}} by a southbound semi-trailer truck from Canada hauling an oversize load to Vancouver, Washington, directly damaging sway struts and, indirectly, the compression chords in the overhead steel frame (<b>trusswork)</b> on the northernmost span of the bridge. The vertical clearance from the roadway to the upper arched beam in the outer lane is 14 ft, and all trucks with oversize loads are expected to travel in the inside lane where the clearance is around 17 ft. The oversize truck instead entered the bridge in the outer lane, while a second semi-truck and a BMW were passing it in the inner lane. The oversize truck had received a State oversize permit for a wide and tall load, for a height of 15 ft, and after the collapse a [...] "dented upper corner and a scrape along the upper side were visible on the 'oversize load' equipment casing being hauled on the truck." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) measured the truck's height, after the crash, to be 15 ft. A pilot car was hired to ensure the load could pass safely.

5000|$|The Red Brick Roads have a {{connection}} to Pullman's spiritual community, for Pullman’s first Presbyterian church chose to locate along them. In the late 1890s, President Enoch A. Bryan of Washington State College called for a church where students could worship. He purchased land on Star Route and led the drive to build Pullman’s first Presbyterian church—completed in 1899 {{at a cost of}} $4,000. The money came partly from Dr. W. A. Spalding of the First United Presbyterian Church of Spokane, Washington, plus monies that Bryan raised in the community. Within fifteen years the rapid growth of the college and the Pullman community necessitated the construction of a larger church. In 1914, the old church was lifted, rotated, and incorporated into a new structure clad in Tenino stone. The new church was praised by the Pullman Herald as a “permanent and lasting piece of art which speaks well of the city.” [...] Following a renovation and reconfiguration in the mid-2000s, the former church is now a multi-unit dwelling knowns as the Greystone Apartments, with some of the original wooden <b>trusswork</b> and stained glass still visible.

40|$|Part I: The {{computer}} program INTRA models the collapse behavior of <b>trusswork</b> offshore structures {{with the aid}} of two types of elements: 'Beam-column' elements, designed to simulate bending dominated failure of structural members, and 'strut' elements, that can represent normal force dominated failure. The behavior of both types of INTRA elements has been investigated by comparison with the results of analytical solutions and of the MARC finite element program. A satisfying performance has been found for the beam-column element BEMC and the strut element ISTR. A Fortran routine has been established to generate the required input parameters for INTRA strut elements, resulting in more exact input values than can be derived {{with the aid of}} the default property generation. A parameter study has been carried out to the behavior of strut elements under conditions that may occur in the modelling of a large North Sea platform. It appears that lateral loads and imposed end rotations each may result in a maximum reduction of buckling strength of 15 %, but that, however, the average reduction is much lower. Also the post-buckling strength is only modestly influenced. A plane frame pushover analysis has been performed with both the INTRA and the MARC programs. The influence of schematizations in INTRA strut elements on the overall structural beahavior appears to be acceptably small. However, serious numerical problems occurred during the INTRA analysis, resulting in a too low prediction of the ultimate load of the platform. Part II: As a preparation to pushover analysis of a complete fixed steel offshore structure, failure of the foundation has been analyzed in a qualitative way. Structure-foundation interaction is considered and some methods are treated to describe load-deformation behavior of piles loaded up to failure. Main attention is paid to methods in conjunction with the {{computer program}} INTRA. Computational rules to achieve load settlement curves for pile groups under extreme loads have been derived with the aid of modified t-z curves. Alternatives are presented to model the foundation in both extensive and more simplified ways. Steel Structures / Structural MechanicsStructural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
