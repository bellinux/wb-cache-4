25|$|The term Novo Cinema is {{now used}} to avoid {{confusion}} with the Brazilian {{movement of the}} same name. This movement gains particular relevance after the Carnation Revolution, pursuing certain experiences of the French New Wave, both in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> anthropology and of political cinema. The generation of the seventies, {{taking advantage of the}} new liberties, explores realism and legend, politics and ethnography, until the late eighties, in conjunction with some directors of the liberated colonies, such as Flora Gomes. Portugal has a notable tradition in the field of docufiction and ethnofiction since Leitão de Barros, who was a contemporary of Robert Flaherty.|$|E
500|$|The song plays over a {{scene in}} the film when the yellow {{submarine}} travels through the Sea of Science, during the Beatles' quest to free Pepperland from the music-hating Blue Meanies. Referring to the psychedelic imagery in the animation, author Stephen Glynn considers that this segment [...] "only 'makes sense' when read as attempting an audio-visual recreation of the hallucinogenic state". Jeremiah Massengale, an academic in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> communication, highlights the sequence as one of many technical innovations introduced by the 1968 film, saying: [...] "accompanying multi-colored, square portrait paintings of the Beatles during 'Only a Northern Song', there's a creative use of an oscillator picking out the sound waves of the track." [...] Glynn cites the drug-inspired imagery of this and two other song sequences as the true reason that Rank pulled Yellow Submarine from its UK cinema run, rather than the company's official reasoning that the film had performed poorly at the box office.|$|E

60|$|Now when I say I make {{my beliefs}} and that I cannot prove {{them to you}} and {{convince}} you of them, {{that does not mean}} that I make them wantonly and regardless of fact, that I throw them off as a child scribbles on a slate. Mr. Ruskin, if I remember rightly, accused Whistler of throwing a pot of paint in the face of the public,--that was the essence of his libel. The artistic method in this field of beliefs, as in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> renderings, is one of great freedom and initiative and great poverty of test, but of no wantonness; the conditions of rightness are none the less imperative because they are mysterious and indefinable. I adopt certain beliefs because I feel the need for them, because I feel an often quite unanalyzable rightness in them; because the alternative of a chaotic life distresses me. My belief in them rests upon the fact that they WORK for me and satisfy my desire for harmony and beauty. They are arbitrary assumptions, if you will, that I see fit to impose upon my universe.|$|E
