50|$|A <b>tieback</b> is a {{horizontal}} wire or rod, or a helical anchor used to reinforce retaining walls for stability. With {{one end of}} the <b>tieback</b> secured to the wall, the other end is anchored to a stable structure, such as a concrete deadman which has been driven into the ground or anchored into earth with sufficient resistance. The tieback-deadman structure resists forces that would otherwise cause the wall to lean, as for example, when a seawall is pushed seaward by water trapped on the landward side after a heavy rain.|$|E

5000|$|Slurry {{walls are}} {{successively}} extended to enclose an area, blocking water and softened earth from flowing into it. Once the concrete has hardened, excavation within the now concrete-wall-enclosed area can proceed. To prevent the concrete wall from collapsing into the newly open area, temporary supports such as <b>tiebacks</b> or internal crossbeams are installed. When completed, the structure built within the walled-off area supports the wall, so that <b>tiebacks</b> or other temporary bracing may be removed.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} effort {{focuses on}} improving sediment control practices used at highway construction projects by employing properly designed and correctly installed silt fence applications. Previous research indi-cated that tying silt fence installations {{back into the}} contour and creat-ing a J-shaped hook (or a <b>tieback)</b> is {{an effective way to}} improve the efficiency of silt fence installations. Silt fences with tiebacks form a tem-porary detention basin, which helps facilitate sediment removal by sedimentation. The purpose of this research was to develop a rational numerical method for designing such silt fence tiebacks at highway construction sites. The proposed method employs a hydrological model to estimate the volume of runoff water generated by the water-shed and balances the water with the storage capacity of the silt fence installed with a <b>tieback.</b> First, the Soil Conservation Service's method is used to estimate the amount of storm water generated during a design storm event.

50|$|Work on the Yaquina Bay Bridge {{began on}} August 1, 1934. The bridge opened on September 6, 1936, {{at a cost}} of $1,301,016 ($ in today's dollars). A total of 220 people worked to pour 30,000 cubic yards (23,000 m³) of {{concrete}} and fabricate 3,100 tons of steel. The contractors were the Gilpin Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, and the General Construction Company of Seattle, Washington. The main arch was built in toward the center from the anchorages, using <b>tiebacks</b> to support the arch until it could be closed.

50|$|Once constructed, {{the bathtub}} walls {{relied on the}} {{presence}} of the basement floors of the WTC to give lateral support. When these were partially destroyed following the collapse of the Twin Towers during the September 11, 2001 attacks, it was feared that removing the resulting debris pile could weaken the walls and cause them to fail, endangering workers and possibly compromising other buildings and flooding {{a significant portion of the}} subway system. During the recovery and clean-up operation, dangerous degradation of the walls was discovered, prompting an emergency operation to install <b>tiebacks</b> to the bedrock to shore up the bathtub walls. Excavation of a new Bathtub was conducted between 2006 and 2008, with the new Bathtub reaching 85 ft underground.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the performance of excavations, supported by anchored diaphragm walls, with particular reference to London Clay, Both the factors that affect excavation performance and past design and analysis are considered in a literature review. For {{the purpose of the}} study, the deformation behaviour of London Clay is interpreted in terms of cross-anisotropic elasticity. A plane finite element computer program, developed {{during the course of the}} work, is briefly described. It is capable of simulating the sequence of excavation and of allowing relative movement on the soil/wall interface. Displacements, stresses, soil pressures on the back of the wall, structural forces on the wall, and excess pore pressures due to undrained loading may be computed. The end of excavation performance of an instrumented excavation in London Clay is back analysed. The undrained stiffness of the day is found to increase significantly with depth from a low value at the ground surface. Reasonable agreement is obtained between the analytical results and field observations. A parametric study is carried out on an excavation in an almost incompressible elastic soil, chosen to be reasonably representative of London Clay. While the presence of a cantilever diaphragm wall reduces elastic displacements in the vicinity of the excavation, it is found that prestressed <b>tiebacks</b> are required to achieve a considerable reduction. The influence of the <b>tiebacks</b> is very dependent on the level of prestress, but relatively insensitive to either inclination or distance to the anchor zone. The study also shows that taking soil anisotropy into account changes the magnitude, though not the pattern of displacement. Assuming the soil to behave in a time-independent elastic manner, the results of undrained and drained analyses are compared, A moderate increase in excavation movements is predicted due to drainage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExcavations in urban–developed {{areas were}} {{commonly}} supported by diaphragm walls with internal braces or <b>tieback</b> anchors. There are still required the necessary civil works {{to serve the}} demands and also to solve the environmental problems. Wales and cross-lot struts {{are by far the}} predominant method for wall support, the large working space inside the excavation provided by a <b>tieback</b> anchor system has a significant construction advantage. This paper aims to evaluate the soil stiffness parameters of the alluvial Taipei soil for tie-back diaphragm wall based on back analysis of case study. The case histories of the Taipei County Administration Centre (TCAC) and NTU Hospital (NTUH) were studied in this paper. The deformation analysis was carried out by available finite element analysis tool using PLAXIS. In the analysis, beam element method together with an elastic perfect plastic soil model was used to design the diaphragm wall and the <b>tieback</b> anchor system. The soil was modelled as Mohr-Coulomb model. According to the basic design, the clay deposits are modelled as undrained behaviour while silty-sand behaves in drained condition. The simulation results show that the maximum horizontal movement occurred at around the bottom of wall. At the final stage of construction, the root mean square deviation (RSMD) between measured and calculated the wall movement was 4 % and 7 % respectively at TCAC and NTUH sites. It was concluded that tied-back diaphragm wall can be satisfactorily modelled using elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb soil model. The predicted soil's modulus of elasticity can be obtained from the SPT-N relationship, for clay deposit layer and for silty-sand deposit...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} connectorized, subsea fiber-optic data link was {{installed}} on the Phillips “Little Dotty ” field in January of 1997, the subsea oil industry has seen a number of projects, where optical fiber has been either critical to the program or has offered significant cost or performance advantages. These projects {{have been at the}} forefront of recent <b>tieback</b> technology development, and have been as diverse as the Norsk Hydro Troll Pilot subsea separation system and the Petrobras SBMS multiphase pump project, to new downhole gauges with remote, real time monitoring, such as the Shell ETAP program. Many of these projects have already been installed or are scheduled for phased installation over the next year or two. Optical fiber has been critical to these programs for a variety of reasons, ranging from data security for fiscal metering subsea through communication bandwidth and electrical noise immunity, to CAPEX reduction for Integrated Service Umbilicals for very deep-water installation (> 2000 m). Many of the goals for the <b>tieback</b> community can be achieved only with the aid of fiber-optic communication. Long step-out distances, or eventually <b>tieback</b> to shore, can benefit from fiber’s unrepeated communication distances of greater than 100 km. High-power, subsea pumps needed to pressure boost fluids over these step-out distances need electrical noise immunity, inherent in optical fiber. Umbilicals designed for long step-outs can be more cost efficient using optical fiber in high-density, small cable designs. While the control systems for complex subsea installations need increased bandwidth, which can easily be supplied by optical fiber, while wet-mate hybrid connectors allow modular installation...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the design process and service {{performance}} of a deep excavation supported by <b>tieback</b> anchored pile walls. The design procedure and design approaches for deep excavation in China are described. Based on the excavation case history for Shenyang, China, design results obtained using the elastic method and the finite element method (FEM) are compared and analyzed. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} analysis of horizontal wall deformations, internal forces in the wall, earth pressures on the wall, ground surface settlements, and stabilities of the excavation. The similarities and differences between the Chinese code (JGJ 120 - 2012) and the European code (EN 1997 - 1) for the design of geotechnical structures are presented based on a design example. Through the comparison, it is indicated that the Chinese code focuses on the design result, while the European code focuses on the design process. The crucial construction methods for reducing construction risk based on the excavation case history are described. The mechanical behaviors of the excavation retained by an anchored pile wall were investigated by analyzing observed field cases. The results provide good, practical guidelines for the design and construction of a <b>tieback</b> anchored pile wall retained excavation in sandy soil...|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{previously}} {{occupied by a}} city-owned parking garage, two four story brick buildings, and a parking lot. After demolition of these structures, a slurry wall was installed around the perimeter, in panels 8-22 feet long. The soil within the slurry was then excavated, and internal bracing installed, with <b>tiebacks</b> along some of the wall. Once the excavation was completed, large spread footings were placed for the internal columns. The below grade parking garage floors were then placed, while erection of the steel frame commenced above. This {{is known as the}} up-up approach (as opposed to up-down). As each floor was placed and cured, the internal bracing was removed. This method allowed the foundation to be installed within feet of the existing structures, without any settlement of those structures.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{of single}} context {{recording}} {{point out that}} it encourages a lazy attitude towards attempts to phase the site while excavation is in progress, and that it diminishes the incentive for archaeologists to interpret what they are digging beyond the boundaries of the context being excavated rather than trying to understand it using the entire area of the site for insight. It is argued that this lack of interpretation leads to a thoughtless use of the law of superposition, creating chronological anomalies from features and contexts of a tunnelling nature such as drain backfills, buried waterfront <b>tiebacks</b> or natural processes. Counter-critics argue that, while this is a possibility, no archaeologist needs to be transfixed by the applied recording system if faced with a stratigraphic conundrum, and that deviation from a pure single context recording regime is not a sin. Furthermore, single context recording is not an excuse for not attempting to view the site as a whole during excavation.|$|R
40|$|Lateral movements, settlements, and {{groundwater}} fluctuations resulting from excavations {{for a project}} in Boston were measured with various types of geotechnical instruments.
