25|$|HSV {{released}} the HSV Grange model in October 1996 (as part of VS II) {{as a sports}} variant of the Caprice. Manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, and finished by HSV at Clayton, Victoria, the Grange was available in 185i and 215i variants, powered by 5.0- and stroked 5.7-litre V8 engines, respectively. The VS Grange was the first Grange produced by HSV, having previously produced Statesman and Caprice models under its own brand. Standard features for the VS II Grange included 17-inch alloy wheels, a ten-speaker sound system with a ten-disc CD stacker, climate control air conditioning, a power adjustable driver's seat (with memory settings), leather upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel adjustment, a trip computer, power sunroof, woodgrain interior trim, an alarm and immobiliser. The 215i variants were also fitted with a Hydratrak limited slip differential.|$|E
50|$|The list {{of premium}} {{features}} on the Baleno RS include; SmartPlay Infotainment System along with Smartphone Connect/Apple CarPlay, GPS Navigation System, voice recognition, nluetooth compatibility, leather wrapped steering wheel, front footwell illumination, illuminated glovebox, height adjustable driver seat, Front centre armrest with storage, Luggage room, illumination, tilt and <b>telescopic</b> power <b>steering</b> wheel with mounted controls, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, push start/stop with smart key, 60:40 split rear seat, projector headlamps, front fog lights, LED Daytime Running Lights, follow me home headlamps, etc.|$|R
5000|$|A 14/60 four-door four-light saloon was road {{tested by}} The Times. Head {{clearance}} {{was described as}} moderate but it was felt there was good width and leg room for two persons {{in the back seat}} and the doorways gave [...] "reasonable entrance". Interior fittings included three electric lights, two-way visors, a sliding roof, three ashtrays, an instrument board with large dial clock and speedometer, a <b>telescopic</b> spring <b>steering</b> wheel, wholly automatic chassis lubrication, a jacking system and a windscreen which could be wound out to give a direct view.|$|R
50|$|Being {{based on}} Fiat's Tipo 2 (Type Two) architecture, the second {{generation}} Delta featured a steel unibody construction, transverse engine, and all-independent suspension. At the front these were of the MacPherson strut type—the lower arms linked to the same subframe which supported the drivetrain—with coaxial coil springs and telescopic dampers, and an anti-roll bar; at the rear there were trailing arms (also connected to the body by a subframe), an anti-roll bar, coil springs and <b>telescopic</b> dampers. <b>Steering</b> was rack and pinion with standard hydraulic power steering. Brakes were discs on all four wheels, except for base 1.6 cars which used drums at the rear. All models used a 5-speed gearbox and were front-wheel drive.|$|R
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total swept area for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} dual master cylinder with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc brakes. Testers found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were {{introduced}} in 1965, as was a [...] "big block" [...] engine option: the [...] V8. Side exhaust pipes were also optionally available in 1965, and continued to be offered through 1967. The introduction of the [...] big block in 1965 spelled {{the beginning of the}} end for the Rochester fuel injection system. The [...] option cost [...] while the fuel injected [...] engine cost [...] Few people could justify spending [...] more for [...] less, even though FI could deliver over 20 mpg on the highway and would keep delivering fuel despite high G-loading in corners taken at racing speeds. [...] Another rare '63 and '64 option was the Z06 competition package, which offered stiffer suspension, bigger, multi-segment lined brakes with finned drums and more, only a couple hundred coupes and ONE convertible were factory-equipped this way in 1963. [...] With only 771 fuel-injected cars built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option at the end of the '65 production, having introduced a less-expensive big block 396 engine rated at 425hp in the middle of the production year and selling over 2,000 in just a few months. For 1966, Chevrolet introduced an even larger [...] Big Block version. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio (mid-1963), air conditioning (late-1963), a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel (1965), and headrests (1966). The Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 Chevrolet Corvair, which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.|$|E

50|$|The ST1 is made {{entirely by}} {{hand with the}} {{exception}} of a high performance, 5 axis CNC router. The ST-1 comes equipped with keyless entry, satellite navigation, <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel adjustment and electrically adjustable leather racing seats.|$|E
50|$|A <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> column {{designed}} to {{collapse in the}} event of a frontal collision (rather than penetrate the driver's chest) had been mainstream in competitor models from Opel and Volkswagen for some time, and with the TC Ford now also incorporated this safety feature on their new mid-size range for Germany and mainland Europe.|$|E
50|$|For the E170 Corolla model, the {{transmission}} is an {{electric power steering}} system offering improved directness and weight; an electric rack and pinion system eliminates an accessory driven hydraulic steering system, reducing parasitic loss. The components of the tilt, <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> structure help improve steering rigidity, and reduce vibration. A more structurally rigid intermediate shaft increases the direct feel of steering. Steering measures 3.19 turns total.|$|E
5000|$|... 2008 model year: the [...] "Limited" [...] {{trim level}} was dropped, leaving [...] "GLS" [...] and [...] "SE" [...] trim choices. The SE trim {{included}} features not {{available on the}} [...] "GLS" [...] such as a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel and electronic stability control (ESC), with sunroof and leather upholstery as options. According to Consumer Reports testing, the [...] "SE" [...] trim has significantly better handling and braking than the base [...] "GLS" [...] trim.|$|E
5000|$|All {{variants}} have ABS+EBD+Dual+Knee Airbags, Rear Parking Camera (except G Manual), Follow Me Home function (Halogen for G, LED for VRZ / SRZ), {{all around}} sensor, glove box with chiller function, Digital Auto AC, all auto power window, tilt and <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> as standard.All variants have Eco-Mode and Power-Mode features to adjust throttle responses.The front brake uses 17" [...] disc brake, whilst the rear brake uses drum brake., except in Australia where disc brakes are used all around.|$|E
50|$|For 1988, Cadillac kept {{cosmetic}} {{changes to}} a minimum {{in anticipation of the}} redesigned DeVille and Fleetwood models to come the following year. To mitigate the nearly $2,000 price jump this year, several previously optional items were made standard equipment including tilt steering column, <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, power trunk release, split-bench front seating, cruise control, and variable delay windshield wipers. Under the hood was a new 155 hp 4.5 L V8 and heavy-duty battery. Pricing rose to $23,049 for Coupe de Ville, and $23,404 for Sedan de Ville.|$|E
50|$|The Forte sold in Canada {{has similar}} {{specifications}} and equipment as the US-market model. Some differences include {{the addition of}} power windows, door locks and power heated exterior mirrors on the base LX trim, a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel on the EX trim, and a standard sunroof and automatic climate control system on the SX trim. The EX and SX also have a chrome-trimmed rear garnish and door handles. In contrast to the transmissions offered in the United States, the automatic transmission on offer in Canada is a 6-speed.|$|E

5000|$|The Kadett B {{inherited}} its suspension {{from the}} Kadett A. Two years after launch, however, in August 1967, the simple longitudinally mounted leaf springs with a centrally connected rigid axle which till then had suspended {{the rear wheels}} were replaced with a more sophisticated set-up incorporating coil springs, trailing arms and a Panhard rod. Road holding was usefully improved. [...] At the same time, reflecting growing preoccupation with secondary safety in the marketplace, the old steering wheel was replaced with a padded [...] "Safety" [...] steering wheel, now mounted on a <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> column {{which was designed to}} collapse {{in the event of a}} serious collision.|$|E
5000|$|Canadian trim {{levels were}} {{different}} from the US models. The base model [...] "L" [...] offered a base package with a four-speaker CD/MP3/Auxiliary stereo and front airbags.

5000|$|GT-S: The GT-S (chassis code ST162) {{was given}} a de-tuned version of the DOHC 2.0 L engine (3S-GELC) {{featuring}} T-VIS and a 6800 rpm redline producing [...] at 6000 rpm and 125 ft-lbs of torque at 4800 rpm. An EGR and O2 sensor restricted the engine along with a milder ECU. The GT-S replaced the rear drum brakes with disc brakes going along with a 5x100 bolt pattern. Standard features {{in addition to the}} GT trim included an 8-way adjustable sports bucket seats with power lumbar and side bolsters, automatic climate control, side mirror defogger, wrap-around spoiler, <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, and speed-rated 205/60-14 tires on 14"x6" [...] alloy wheels. Leather interior including shift knob, door panel inserts, and steering wheel were optional. In Canada, all GT-S models were 5-speed (S53) manual transmissions, but in America, an electronic controlled 4-speed automatic (A140E) with lock-up torque converter was available. New features in 1988-1989 included an illuminated vanity light as standard and ABS as optional.|$|E
5000|$|For 1990, DeVille and Fleetwood {{lost their}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> column, but {{retained}} the tilt feature {{in exchange for}} an airbag mounted onto the newly standard leather-trimmed steering wheel. Engine output was up an additional [...] from sequential multi-port fuel injection. 1990 models also received GM's PASS Key theft-deterrent system which used a coded electronic pellet embedded into the ignition key. Other new features for 1990 included a non-illuminated vanity mirror on the driver's visor (a passenger side visor mirror had been standard equipment for decades now), door edge guards (previously optional), [...] "clam shell" [...] front center armrest with storage, and manual seat-back recliners for driver and passenger. While Lincoln's Continental did not fare well against DeVille, a new sales threat—aimed directly at Cadillac—came from the 1990 debut of Toyota's Lexus LS400 and the Infiniti Q45 from Nissan.

40|$|This {{document}} {{discusses the}} design, analysis, manufacturing {{and testing of}} the One-Ride human powered vehicle which was entered into the 2015 ASME West Coast HPVC Competition. The goal of the vehicle is to entice people to switch from gas powered vehicles to the One-Ride for trips of up to 20 miles round trip. The One-Ride design features fully adjustable seating and steering positions and was designed to fit anyone between the heights of 52 ̆ 722 ̆ 2  and 62 ̆ 742 ̆ 2  comfortably. The seat is adjusted using metal sliders, manufactured in the SCU machine shop, which fit into brackets attached to the frame. The bike features <b>telescopic</b> <b>steering</b> which is adjusted by the loosening and tightening of collar clamps. To increase the strength and safety of the frame, the welding and heat treatment were contracted to industry professionals. The frame was welded by Chavez Welding and heat treated by Byington Steel Treating. Deformation in the seat frame during heat treatment prevented full adjustability of the seat, however was secured in its middle position for testing. The wheelbase of the bike is 73. 33 in and has an overall height of 50. 77 in.. Slop in the steering caused instability at low speeds, which prevented the bike from being ridden in the ASME HPVC Competition. Design solutions to both of these problems have been identified. At the completion of senior design, the manufacturing is still ongoing...|$|E
