50|$|Batho {{joined the}} French Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste - PS) {{in the mid-1990s}} as a militant in the Grigny (Essonne) section. She participated, {{together}} with Julien Dray, in the party's Socialist Left tendency. At the party's Grenoble Congress she {{was elected to the}} national executive committee of the PS. In 2003, during the breakup of the socialist left, she remained loyal <b>to</b> <b>Dray,</b> who employed her at the Île-de-France Regional Council, where she was responsible for security matters. In 2004 she became National Secretary of the PS in charge of security, where she defended the policy of preventative sanctions.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was soon}} {{realised}} {{after the opening}} of the Nelson – Foxhill section that the inconvenience of transferring goods traffic from trains <b>to</b> <b>drays</b> <b>to</b> transfer it to the port at Nelson station was sufficient enough for many merchants in Nelson and surrounding areas to avoid the railway altogether and to ship their goods directly to the port by road. [...] This loss of freight traffic from the railways gave sufficient motivation to the Railways Department for them to make the port section the next {{to be added to the}} line.|$|R

50|$|Another {{attempt was}} made at mining the site {{at the start of}} the 20th century, though this also closed by 1912. Transport was easier this time but ore still had <b>to</b> be <b>drayed</b> <b>to</b> the train line at Farina, 100 km away. All that remains of this {{settlement}} are two large boilers, some mine shafts, some dugouts and the cemetery.|$|R
5000|$|The Swamp {{had a more}} {{reliable}} water supply than Drayton and soil well suited to farming. It was also closer to the new Toll Bar road over the Great Dividing Range which had a gradient better suited <b>to</b> <b>dray</b> traffic. By 1852 Horton was already arranging to build another hotel at [...] "The Swamp" [...] and by 1855 was offering the Bull's Head Hotel for sale with a three-year lease in place. A rivalry between the two settlements had developed which would eventually result in Drayton's eclipse by Toowoomba, as [...] "The Swamp" [...] was later named.|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve air quality, the Port of Long Beach (POLB) and Port of Los Angeles (POLA) {{implemented}} their joint Clean Truck Program (CTP) with stringent limits on the trucks allowed <b>to</b> <b>dray</b> containers from their terminals. As a result, many trucks serving the POLB were either banned or required expensive retrofitting to reduce diesel emissions. The POLA implemented similar restrictions along with an additional ban on trucks that are independently owned and operated. Accordingly, the CTP {{reduced the number of}} independent owner operators providing drayage services at these ports. Independent owner operators fall under criticism for being more dangerous than other commercial truck drivers. Some argue that fierce competition and thin profit margins lead them to drive more aggressively and cut corners when it comes to safely maintaining their trucks. This study investigates whether the CTP impacted safety on highways surrounding the POLB and POLA. Weekly accident and traffic data from highways carrying heavy drayage traffic, namely Interstates 110 and 710, are analyzed to determine if the risk of an accident fell on these highways after the CTP???s implementation. Results, using a negative binomial regression framework, suggest no significant change in accident risk after the CTP implementation...|$|E

Billibellary searched for him, and when found carried him to a {{homestead}} where he was transported back <b>to</b> Melbourne by <b>dray</b> <b>to</b> be cared for and have his wound dressed {{for a period of}} two months by Assistant Protector William Thomas and wife Susannah.|$|R
5000|$|A bridle {{track was}} {{established}} to Glorit on the Kaipara Harbour in 1899, and part was improved <b>to</b> a <b>dray</b> road the following year. [...] The North Auckland Line reached Kaipara Flats from Ahuroa in 1906.|$|R

He collected 15.65% of the votes (9.54% of the registered voters) and was therefore not qualified for the second round.|$|R
50|$|Important locales {{introduced}} {{in this novel}} include the hidden city of the Savanti, the northern plains of the continent of Segesthes, and the city state of Zenicce on the same continent. It also introduces the dove, used by the Savanti <b>to</b> monitor <b>Dray</b> Prescot, and the Gdoinye, a colourful bird of prey send by the Star Lords for the same task.|$|R
5000|$|The camels {{were used}} as pack animals, {{especially}} in the north, while in the south, camels were used <b>to</b> pull <b>drays</b> with supplies for the riders. Camels were ideal for this as they could go {{for a long time}} without water, and it has been suggested [...] that the fence could not have been built or maintained without the use of camels.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, bullock carts were {{referred}} <b>to</b> as bullock <b>drays</b> and were usually {{used to carry}} large loads. Drays were pulled by bullock teams which could consist of 20 or more animals.|$|R

50|$|On July 8, 2010, the Cardinals signed <b>Dray</b> <b>to</b> a {{four-year}} contract. The team did not announce {{the terms of}} the deal, but Adam Caplan of Foxsports.com reported that the contract was worth $1.84 million with a $49,000 signing bonus.|$|R

5000|$|Bullockies often chose Devon cattle {{because they}} were plentiful, hardy, {{tractable}} and readily matched up the team, which was often {{a source of pride}} to the owners. Teams had to be educated to perform their respective tasks, too. The first part of a bullock’s education began when the bullocky tied two young bullocks together with two heavy leather collars and a connecting chain. Thus connected they were turned out to graze and rest until they accepted the close presence of their partner. Untrained bullocks were then put in the centre of the team, where they were more easily controlled with the assistance and guidance of the [...] "leaders” who were well trained to verbal commands. Pairs of bullocks were matched for size and yoked together using a wooden yoke secured to each bullock by a metal bow which was fixed in place by key on top of the yoke. Each pair was connected by a special chain, which ran from a central ring on each yoke to the next pair, thus coupling the team in tandem fashion. The “wheelers” or “polers” were the older, heavier, trained bullocks which were closest <b>to</b> the <b>dray</b> or jinker and helped to slow the load when necessary. Thus then was the team attached <b>to</b> the <b>dray</b> or jinker.|$|R
50|$|The Beavers {{scored on}} every {{drive in the}} first half to take a 31-7 halftime lead {{on their way to a}} 38-28 defeat of the Cardinal. Jacquizz Rodgers ran for a career-high 189 yards and a school record-tying four {{touchdown}}s. His brother James added the fifth touchdown and a Justin Kahut 31-yard field goal completed the scoring for the Beavers. After falling behind early, Stanford was forced out of its usual Toby Gerhart-led power rushing game, though Gerhart still managed 96 yards and two touchdowns. Andrew Luck added two touchdown passes, one to Chris Owusu and another <b>to</b> Jim <b>Dray.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dray {{was ready}} for Lisa. However, at the last minute, Katrina showed up to apologize, yet she becomes fascinated with Dray in which this entire time she also fantasized about him. Before leaving, she made a move on Dray and they ended up having sex, in which she ended up having her fantasy fulfilled. Lisa returns and Katrina was able to leave without her noticing. However as Lisa changed into her nightwear, she sees a dress and heels with smears of {{lipstick}} conveying in a message: [...] "Busted Adapt." [...] It was clear that Katrina left those behind <b>to</b> set <b>Dray</b> up as Dray realizes that he finally got caught.|$|R
50|$|Between 1871 and 1888, {{the value}} of the {{fixtures}} at the brewery rose from £138 to £1765. Nimmo was innovative, building the second pneumatic maltings in England in 1878-9, and his was among the first breweries <b>to</b> adopt powered <b>drays</b> in 1892. In 1892, J. Nimmo & Son Ltd was registered as a limited liability company with 41 public houses.|$|R
50|$|A drayage {{company and}} draymen provide {{carriage}} from or to a port or rail ramp. The items hauled are either ocean or rail containers. The contents are either cross docked for outbound long haul carriage or the container is <b>drayed</b> <b>to</b> the receiver who unloads it. The drayman then hauls the empty {{back to the}} ocean port or rail yard.|$|R
5000|$|The lifts took {{different}} forms. F W Bolton, {{the manager}} of Farleigh Mill, is credited with introducing the [...] "traverser" [...] type by 1891. This consisted of an overhead travelling winch which traversed a horizontal beam supported by two posts. The cane was laid flat on a sling in a dray which was driven under the winch. The winch was used to hoist the bundle of cane which was traversed about two metres and lowered into a tramway wagon parked next <b>to</b> the <b>dray.</b> The lift was praised at the time for greatly reducing loading times and enabling the cane to be packed more densely. Apparently this type of lift was widely adopted {{but there are no}} known examples extant in the Mackay area.|$|R
50|$|Yet another local story {{holds that}} three stonemasons, from Armidale, New South Wales, were {{employed}} {{to work on the}} building which apparently took four years to construct. The stone {{is believed to have been}} quarried from nearby Limestone Ridge, while the roof framing timbers were cut at a local saw pit, and the iron roof sheeting carried by rail to Hughenden then by <b>dray</b> <b>to</b> Boulia. The house was reputedly constructed without nails.|$|R
5000|$|January 23, 1850"While {{the boys}} were away at the beach, I heard {{somebody}} shout excitedly, five or six times, and, on going out of the house, I noticed Mr McLure ahead of me, running towards the saw-pit. I followed as fast as I could and was astonished <b>to</b> see our <b>dray,</b> tipped up, with the two shafter-bullocks hanging by the bows from the pole which had become caught in a native [...] "cherry".|$|R
5000|$|The M.Y. Lady of the Lake {{was ordered}} by the Ullswater Steam Navigation Company, a {{predecessor}} of the current owners, to a design by Douglas Henson of Penrith. She was built by T.B. Seath & Co at Rutherglen near Glasgow, transported in three sections by rail to Penrith, and thence by horse <b>drays</b> <b>to</b> Waterside near Pooley Bridge. She was assembled on the slipway at Waterside and launched on 26 June 1877.|$|R
50|$|The Cardinal {{surprised}} the Ducks, 51-42, to become bowl-eligible {{for the first}} time in eight years. Toby Gerhart ran for three touchdowns and a school-record 223 yards on 38 carries, breaking the previous record of 220 set by Jon Volpe in 1988. He also broke his single-season rushing record set last year with 1,217 yards. Andrew Luck finished 12 for 20 for 251 yards, throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> Jim <b>Dray</b> in the second quarter and a 31-yarder to Chris Owusu after Oregon cut the Cardinal lead to 10 points early in the third quarter. Oregon closed within six points late in the fourth quarter following a missed Stanford field goal, but Stanford recovered the ensuing onside kick. A field goal with 11 seconds remaining put the game away.|$|R
50|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Wilkes'/Hose's ears, fingers and genitals were severed. The skin {{from his face}} was removed and his body was doused with kerosene. He was tied to a tree and burned alive. Some members of the mob cut off pieces of his dead body as souvenirs. According <b>to</b> Philip <b>Dray's</b> At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America, the noted civil rights leader and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, who lived in Atlanta at the time, {{was on his way}} to a scheduled meeting with Atlanta Constitution editor Joel Chandler Harris to discuss the lynching, when he was informed that Hose's knuckles were for sale in a grocery store on the road on which he was walking. He turned around and did not meet with Harris after learning this.|$|R
50|$|Altgeld's name, {{according}} <b>to</b> historian Philip <b>Dray,</b> “is {{synonymous with}} {{the dawn of the}} Progressive era.” His first public post was city attorney in Savannah, Missouri, in which capacity he rewrote a code of ordinances. In Missouri Altgeld became involved in the Granger movement and the Democratic Party and was elected to be state's attorney for the county in 1874. As Altgeld later wrote, he quickly became disillusioned with the criminal justice system and resigned after just one year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state of}} {{transport}} in 1871 {{is illustrated by}} {{a description of the}} Saunders family arrival. It says they took a boat from Raglan to Bridle Creek, then a bullock <b>dray</b> <b>to</b> Kauroa, pack horses to Te Mata and then had to widen the track to Te Hutewai to get their packs through. At its January 2, 1872 meeting, the Karioi Board decided to call for tenders to form the Te Mata-Raglan road in the worst places.|$|R
5|$|Although {{originally}} bred {{for use on}} farms, {{few members}} of the breed are used for agricultural purposes today, and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas.

The brewery owned 210Jutlands at their peak, and today still uses about 20 for transporting beer around Copenhagen. The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations at many shows, promoting the brewery and the breed.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{generally}} {{send their}} drays {{every two or}} three months down to the nearest store, which may, of course, be fifty miles off, or even more. Here, fortunately, you will not be obliged at first <b>to</b> have a <b>dray,</b> but can send any produce you have to sell down by water, which is a far cheaper and more convenient mode of carriage. You will not have much to send for some time, so that will not trouble you at present." ...|$|R
