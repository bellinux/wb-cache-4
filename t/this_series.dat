40|$|Abstract. — In {{this article}} we define a Poincaré series on a {{subspace}} of a complex analytic germ, induced by a multi-index filtration on the ambient space. We compute <b>this</b> Poincaré <b>series</b> for subspaces defined by principal ideals. For plane curve singularities and nondegenerate singularities <b>this</b> Poincaré <b>series</b> yields topological and geometric information. We compare <b>this</b> Poincaré <b>series</b> with the one introduced in [E,G-Z]. In few cases they are equal and we show that the Poincaré series we consider in this paper in general yields more information. In [C,D,K] one introduced a Poincaré series induced by a filtration on the ring of germs of a complex variety. <b>This</b> Poincaré <b>series</b> has been studied for several kinds of singularities, see for example [C,D,G-Z 1], [C,D,G-Z 2], [C,D,G-Z 3], [Eb,G-Z], [CHR], [L], [GP-H] and [N].
