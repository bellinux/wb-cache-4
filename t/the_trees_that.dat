5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> make up the forest composition, and habitat fragmentation {{as a result of}} urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Settlement {{continued}} {{to follow the}} river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened and offered a flood plain conducive {{to the development of}} a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> filled the surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.|$|E

5|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of tiger bush and fir waves. Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E

25|$|Northern {{hardwood}} forests grow at Elk Knob State Park. This type {{of forest}} consists of sugar maple, American beech, yellow buckeye and yellow birch trees. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> grow near the summits of Rittle and Elk Knobs have been stunted {{by the low}} temperatures, high elevation and high winds. Trees that {{are just a few}} feet high can be well over one hundred years old.|$|E
25|$|If a {{tree species}} in a dense forest grows taller than {{surrounding}} tree species, it {{is able to}} absorb more of the incoming sunlight. However, less sunlight is then available for <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> are shaded by the taller tree, thus interspecific competition. Leopards and lions can also be in interspecific competition, since both species feed on the same prey, and can be negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food.|$|E
25|$|Jacarandas {{are also}} popular in the {{southern}} and central parts of Florida and the southwestern United States, notably in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Diego, California. Jacaranda can be found throughout most of Southern California, where they were imported by the horticulturalist Kate Sessions. In California, jacarandas are known as <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> bloom twice a year, although the fall bloom is generally not as striking as the spring bloom. Tampa, St. Petersburg, and other southern Florida cities are ribboned by purple flowers during peak bloom of April. Jacaranda trees are principally found in parks and interspersed along the avenues and streets.|$|E

25|$|Although Xp {{necessarily}} includes {{at least}} one forest, {{it is not true}} that all graphs in Xp are forests: for instance, X1 consists of two graphs, a seven-vertex tree and the triangle K3. However, the set of trees in Xp may be precisely characterized: these trees are exactly <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> can be formed from three trees in X'p−1 by connecting a new root vertex by an edge to an arbitrarily chosen vertex {{in each of the three}} smaller trees. For instance, the seven-vertex tree in X1 is formed in this way from the two-vertex tree (a single edge) in X0. Based on this construction, the number of forbidden minors in X'p can be shown to be at least (p!)2. The complete set X2 of forbidden minors for pathwidth-2 graphs has been computed; it contains 110 different graphs.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{products}} {{have always been}} a staple to the economy, comprising 1% of the total gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing as of 2013. In 2007 Windham County contained the largest concentration of kilns for drying lumber east of the Mississippi River. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% forest in 1880s when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing land. Over 85% of that area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families. In 2013 73.054 million cubic feet of wood was harvested in Vermont. A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21.504 million feet being shipped overseas plus an additional 16.384 million cubic feet to Canada. Most of it was processed within the state. In this century the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half. The annual net growth has been estimated at 172.810 million cubic feet. The USDA estimates that 8.584 billion cubic feet remain in the state. Forest products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used in houses and furniture hold carbon {{for long periods of time}} while <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> were removed are replaced overtime with new growing stock. While wood pellets are replacing coal in European power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and preventing mountaintop removal for coal mining.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} transfer, Grant began his {{campaign}} to capture Vicksburg and open the Mississippi River. After the initial failure of his traditional overland approach, he devised several plans aimed at bypassing the fixed defenses of the city. One of these {{became known as the}} Steele's Bayou Expedition. Mound City, now commanded by Lieutenant Commander Byron Wilson, {{was a member of a}} flotilla that attempted to reach the Yazoo River through a web of bayous, sloughs, creeks, and rivers. Porter himself accompanied the expedition and made the important decisions. Progress was slow because of the tight turns in the narrow streams, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> overhung the channels, and willow roots that clung to the hulls of the vessels as they attempted to pass; they were brought to a complete halt by Confederate soldiers who felled trees in the intended path. Unable to dislodge the enemy, Porter ordered a retreat, but then found that a party of Rebels had circled behind him and were cutting him off. Porter sent an immediate appeal for help to Grant, and then had his subordinates prepare to destroy their vessels rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The appeal was passed on to Major General William T. Sherman, commanding the Fifteenth Army Corps and already in the vicinity. He ordered two of his regiments forward immediately, and they met up with Porter's flotilla on the afternoon of 21 March. Sherman himself accompanied a larger body of troops that arrived in the enemy's rear the next day. The surprised Confederate soldiers immediately fled. Although the expedition was no longer opposed by the Rebels, Porter and Sherman concluded that nothing would be gained by resuming the advance. Accordingly, the retreat continued, and the flotilla was back on the Mississippi on 27 March.|$|E

500|$|The Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) {{are among}} the first groups of work {{completed}} after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888.

He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, {{a strong sense of}} personal style began to emerge during this period.
