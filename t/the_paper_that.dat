5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the 25 {{personnel}} of the Comité {{joined the}} CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E

Von Kammacher travels to Berlin, where he meets a young dancer named Ingigerd (Ida Orloff) and the doctor becomes fond of her and very interested in her. However she has a large amount of admirers and thus Von Kammacher gives up on her.

25|$|During the Great Depression, Mencken did {{not support}} the New Deal.

He ceased writing for the Baltimore Sun for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor, while serving as an adviser for <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> had been his home for nearly his entire career. In 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene, covering the presidential election in which President Harry S. Truman faced Republican Thomas Dewey and Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party.

25|$|His views so grated Diether Lauenstein, who had {{recently}} purchased <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>that</b> he was fired from the Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in 1978. Dahlmann alleges that Lauenstein fired him on 20 April 1978, the birthday of Adolf Hitler. Lauenstein was fiercely pro-apartheid and a staunch Namibian right-wing Nationalist at odds with Dahlmanns' own views, which were considerably more liberal and center left. Dahlmann would later state publicly that the acquisition of the paper by Lauenstein was {{at the behest of}} the South African government with the view of expanding its dominance over Namibia. Dahlmanns' Namibian activism was based on three premises: the end of apartheid, continued independence vs integration with South Africa, and universal, race- and gender-independent, suffrage for all Namibians.|$|E
25|$|Hu Fengyi, now deputy {{director}} of the Food Crops Institute at YAAS, worked on the IRRI perennial-rice project and was senior author of <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> first reported on mapping of genes for rhizome production in rice. Using the F2 population derived from the Oryza sativa/O. longistaminata cross, two dominant-complimentary genes, rhz2 and rhz3 controlling rhizomatousness were mapped. These were found to correspond with two QTLs associated with rhizomatousness in the genus Sorghum, suggesting that the evolution of the annual habit occurred independently, long after these species diverged. Efforts to map these genes in rice more finely are ongoing. Although other genes undoubtedly contribute to perenniality and rhizomatousness, these two are required in rice. Breeders use markers for these genes to assist in identifying potentially perennial individuals.|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> make it very hard to copy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the general}} election, he faced Democrat Jerry Brady in the November 7 general election. Brady, the former {{publisher}} of The Post Register in Idaho Falls, had {{run for governor}} in 2002, losing to incumbent Republican Governor Dirk Kempthorne. Otter was initially considered an overwhelming favorite, given his popularity and Idaho's strong Republican lean. However, the race was far closer than expected in the last weeks of the campaign. A poll conducted for the Idaho Statesman and Boise ABC affiliate KIVI showed Otter ahead of Brady by only a single point– a statistical dead heat. According to the Statesman, {{it was the first}} time in over a decade that the governor's race has not already been decided 10 days prior to the election. State Republican Party chairman Kirk Sullivan told <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> the race appeared to be closer than normal because of a strong national trend against the Republicans. Otter pulled away in the final week, and won the election 53%–44%, the closest gubernatorial race since 1994.|$|E

Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, and his attempts to drain the Everglades.

Use of a tungsten light source with the quartz Littrow prism as a monochromator was reported to minimize light scattering within the instrument.|$|E

500|$|After {{nearly three}} hours of shouts from the angry crowd, {{officers}} moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter [...] "Make sure you put in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> I ate too many Twinkies."

Schlafly wrote again and requested the raw data. Lenski replied again that the relevant data was already in <b>the</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "raw data" [...] were living bacterial samples, which he would willingly share with qualified researchers at properly equipped biology labs, and that he felt insulted by letters and comments on Conservapedia which he saw as brusque and offensive, including claims of outright deceit.
