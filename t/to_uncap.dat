The building is sometimes referred to as the Comiskey Mansion, and it was described as the former home of Charles Comiskey by Eleanor Roosevelt in her newspaper column after she took part in the dedication of the South Side Community Art Center. According <b>to</b> <b>UNCAP,</b> the Uncovering New Chicago Archives Project, the house belonging to Comiskey was further south on Michigan Avenue. The community paid for the lease and purchase of the building, for utilities, and for art supplies. The federal government helped to stimulate the establishment of the center via support from the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. They provided administrative funds for staff and faculty and funds for the remodeling of the building. The interior was remodeled in the New Bauhaus-style by Hin Bredendieck and Nathan Lerner and the centre opened unofficially for its first classes on December 15, 1940. The opening was accompanied by an inaugural exhibition of paintings by local black artists including Charles Davis, Charles White, Bernard Goss, William Carter, Eldzier Cortor, Charles Sebree, Archibald Motley, Jr., amongst others. The interracial faculty of art instructors included Davis, White, Goss, Carter, Morris Topchevsky, Si Gordon, Max Kahn, and Todros Geller. Lessons were free and included oil painting, drawing, composition, water color, sculpture, lithography, poster design, fashion illustration, interior decoration, silk screen, weaving, and hooked rug-making. By March 1941, 13,500 people had attended classes, exhibitions, and events at the center. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated the facility May 7, 1941, in a ceremony that broadcast nationwide on CBS Radio.|$|E

40|$|Oral {{presentation}} {{skills are}} highly valued {{in the job}} market and are stated graduate learning outcomes for many Australian universities. In a number of degree programs, the ability to voice opinions in class and participate in collaborative learning situations are assessable, and crucial to student success and ultimately employability. The ability to present to an audience is likewise a vital skill in higher education and in later employment, particularly in the areas of business, law and education. Yet up to 75 % of the population is so afraid of public speaking that they may not physically or mentally be able to perform such tasks without some form of intervention. Nonetheless, in Australian universities, we tend not to scaffold oral presentation skills, and assessments of the skills are primarily summative. This paper will review the literature surrounding social anxiety and fear of public speaking {{as it relates to the}} capacities of students to demonstrate such skills and engage in these forms of assessment.

40|$|Bulk {{solution}} assays {{have shown}} that the isolated CARMIL homology 3 (CAH 3) domain from mouse and Acanthamoeba CARMIL rapidly and potently restores actin polymerization when added to actin filaments previously capped with capping protein (CP). To demonstrate this putative uncapping activity directly, we used total internal reflection microscopy to observe single, CP-capped actin filaments before and after the addition of the CAH 3 domain from mouse CARMIL- 1 (mCAH 3). The addition of mCAH 3 rapidly restored the polymerization of individual capped filaments, consistent with uncapping. To verify uncapping, filaments were capped with recombinant mouse CP tagged with monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP-CP). Restoration of polymerization upon the addition of mCAH 3 was immediately preceded by the complete dissociation of mGFP-CP from the filament end, confirming the CAH 3 -driven uncapping mechanism. Quantitative analyses showed that the percentage of capped filaments that uncapped increased as the concentration of mCAH 3 was increased, reaching a maximum of ∼ 90 % at ∼ 250 nm mCAH 3. Moreover, the time interval between mCAH 3 addition and uncapping decreased as the concentration of mCAH 3 increased, with the half-time of CP at the barbed end decreasing from ∼ 30 min without mCAH 3 to ∼ 10 s with a saturating amount of mCAH 3. Finally, using mCAH 3 tagged with mGFP, we obtained direct evidence that the complex of CP and mCAH 3 has a small but measurable affinity for the barbed end, as inferred from previous studies and kinetic modeling. We conclude that the isolated CAH 3 domain of CARMIL (and presumably the intact molecule as well) possesses the ability <b>to</b> <b>uncap</b> CP-capped actin filaments...|$|E
40|$|The actin-based {{motility}} of Listeria monocytogenes {{requires the}} addition of actin monomers to the barbed or plus ends of actin filaments. Immunofluorescence micrographs have demonstrated that gelsolin, a protein that both caps barbed ends and severs actin filaments, is concentrated directly behind motile bacteria at the junction between the actin filament rocket tail and the bacterium. In contrast, CapG, a protein that strictly caps actin filaments, fails to localize near intracellular Listeria. To explore the effect of increasing concentrations of gelsolin on bacterial motility, NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts stably transfected with gelsolin cDNA were infected with Listeria. The C 5 cell line containing 2. 25 times control levels of gelsolin supported significantly higher velocities of bacterial movement than did control fibroblasts (mean ± standard error of the mean, 0. 09 ± 0. 003 μm/s [n = 176] versus 0. 05 ± 0. 003 μm/s [n = 65]). The rate of disassembly of the Listeria-induced actin filament rocket tail {{was found to be}} independent of gelsolin content. Therefore, if increases in gelsolin content result in increases in Listeria-induced rocket tail assembly rates, a positive correlation between gelsolin content and tail length would be expected. BODIPY-phalloidin staining of four different stably transfected NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast cell lines confirmed this expectation (r = 0. 92). Rocket tails were significantly longer in cells with a high gelsolin content. Microinjection of gelsolin 1 / 2 (consisting of the amino-terminal half of native gelsolin) also increased bacterial velocity by more than 2. 2 times. Microinjection of CapG had no effect on bacterial movement. Cultured skin fibroblasts derived from gelsolin-null mice were capable of supporting intracellular Listeria motility at velocities comparable to those supported by wild-type skin fibroblasts. These experiments demonstrated that the surface of Listeria contains a polymerization zone that can block the barbed-end-capping activity of both gelsolin and CapG. The ability of Listeria <b>to</b> <b>uncap</b> actin filaments combined with the severing activity of gelsolin can accelerate actin-based motility. However, gelsolin is not absolutely required for the actin-based intracellular movement of Listeria because its function can be replaced by other actin regulatory proteins in gelsolin-null cells, demonstrating the functional redundancy of the actin system...|$|E
40|$|There’s {{not much}} for {{children}} in this budget, according to the Australian Council for Educational Research’s Alison Elliott THIS week’s federal budget offers little {{in response to the}} growing educational, ethical and economic imperatives to provide high-quality early childhood programs. There is no mention of lifting child care quality, nothing about universal preschool education, no additional places to train early childhood teachers, no increase in Child Care Benefit payments, no mention of tax deductions for employer provided child care places, and no meaningful early childhood payment scheme to let parents remain at home while children are young or seek early childhood care and education. Nor does the budget include operational subsidies for community-based child care, any substantial increase to the Family Tax Benefit threshold, or an indication that carers in family day care could claim the Child Care Benefit when they cared for their own children alongside those from other families. The budget’s major childcare decision - <b>to</b> <b>uncap</b> subsidised places in family day care and out of school hours care - is unlikely to have any impact on the dire shortfall in early childhood care and education places and growing concerns about child care quality. A ‘subsidised’ place really means a place eligible for a Child Care Benefit payment. But the payment in itself is already capped by means tested family eligibility. The maximum rate of $ 144 for one child starts to reduce as families earn over about $ 34, 000. Until now, centre-based child care places have been uncapped, but family day care and out of school places have been set by the budget. Uncapping the number of places tied to the child care benefit doesn’t solve the shortage of places or improve the quality of early childhood programs. It’s especially difficult to imagine how the new 25, 000 family day care and out of school places by 2009 are going to be operationalised without substantial resourcing and careful planning. In fact, there are currently an estimated 30, 000 unfilled child care places and about unused 65, 000 out of school hours places. The number of centre-based child care places is governed by the number of licensed and accredited centres and theoretically these can be unlimited. Each centre is licensed for a certain number of ‘places’. These places can be tied to a set number of subsidised hours in care per day and up to 50 hours per week and may be occupied by more than one child. So a ‘ 60 place centre’ for example, has facilities and staff to safely care for up to 60 children at anyone time, but might have an enrolment of three times that number. The key issue in child care is not so much lack of places but where they are located. Out of school care must be located at or close to children’s schools rather than parents’ workplaces. Child care places must be in areas of high need, that is in communities with high parental employment and at or near workplaces. Centres are expensive to establish and run and qualified staff difficult to find. The greatest capital expenses are in cities with high land and building costs. Suburban centres in areas of full employment and high housing costs also have difficulty attracting staff, especially lower paid carers. Low paid child care workers are less likely to live in more affluent areas and travel, shift work and related work-family balance issues makes employment problematic. For them, nannying might well be a more realistic and profitable option. Family day care is based in normal family homes and is typically operated by a mother who cares for four or so young children. In areas of high employment, where the demand for care is highest, there are few stay-at-home mothers willing to care for other people’s children. Further, the requirements for playspaces, and other safety issues render many homes unsuitable for family day care, especially in built up or even rural areas and in rental properties. And, unless carers have a car that can carry three or more children they become prisoners in their homes. Using public transport with several young children in tow is clearly not an option. An increase of 10, 000 family day care places, assuming about 4 children per carer, would require 2, 500 new carers and homes. Often carers have only one or two children in care, and/or work part-time, meaning more carers are needed to create these extra places. Home based carers operate within schemes typically run by local government or community based organisations. Recruiting carers, training them and supporting them with playgroups, resources and child development advice are major undertakings. Establishing new family day care schemes requires premises and day to day operational costs to support carers; existing quality assurance processes are already stretching organisational resources. It {{will be interesting to see}} the extent to which private providers seek to enter the family day care and out of school care market. Unlimited increases in family day care places assume there will be thousands of women just waiting at home to set up small businesses caring for other people’s children for poor financial returns. There are not. Increasing places in out of school care also requires a host of new and, it’s to be hoped, trained staff, together with more resources, including buildings. An increase of, say, 15, 000 places, at 20 places per staff member, would require about 750 new staff. Staff are often young, energetic tertiary students who fit early morning or afternoon shifts around their study. They too can be hard to attract to child care, especially in some communities. Already, many family day care and out of school places are going begging because they are located in areas of low need. Careful planning is required to ensure that new and existing child care places end up where there are shortages. Strategic thinking in conjunction with local government is needed to target areas of high and likely demand. Vacant centre based child care, family day care or out of school places in Western Sydney are not much use to a family in Sydney’s inner west or in Melbourne or Brisbane. The announcement of a national hotline designed to direct parents to child-care vacancies in their area is certainly welcome and will help parents find services. Again, though, it doesn’t address the mismatch between vacancies and need. Given the structure of family day care, regulatory requirements and the characteristics of carers, the likelihood of it coming to the gardenless apartments and terraces of inner suburbia any time soon are remote. Family day care can be a very successful alternative to formal child-care centres, providing an intimate home and family environment for babies and toddlers. But although they are wonderfully warm and nurturing, carers tend not to have formal early childhood qualifications and many parents wonder about their ability to provide stimulating learning environments. Older children, especially in the year or two before school, require rich early childhood programs provided by qualified early childhood educators. Recent national recruitment drives to boost the number of people running family day care in their homes are likely to be unsuccessful - at least in the areas where care is most needed - because potential carers are not available, remuneration is poor and home-based physical conditions can be hard to meet. For all the recent rhetoric about universal preschool for all four year olds there was nothing in the budget hinting at developments in this area. And payments from the controversial 30 per cent child care tax rebate will still be made eighteen months in arrears. All children need access to developmentally and educationally significant early childhood programs and a seamless transition from child care to preschool and kindergarten and to school. Anything less ignores the strong evidence base on the positive impact of quality early childhood experiences on longer term educational outcomes - not to mention piece of mind for working parents. It also ignores many families’ desperate search for quality, affordable care and early education for their children. The goodwill surrounding care and early education has never been stronger. There is no better time to set ideologies, market forces, turf wars, and partisan party politics aside for children’s and families’ futures. But action must be swift and decisive or the already complicated, unwieldy and inefficient early childhood sector will become more and more difficult to navigate and to fix. • Alison Elliott is the Research Director, Early Childhood Education, at the the Australian Council for Educational Research Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{the ultimate}} and irreversible loss of replicative capacity occurring in primary somatic cell culture. It is triggered as a stereotypic response to unrepaired nuclear DNA damage or <b>to</b> <b>uncapped</b> telomeres. In addition to a direct role of nuclear DNA double-strand breaks as inducer of a DNA damage response, two more subtle types of DNA damage induced by physiological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can {{have a significant impact}} on cellular senescence: Firstly, it has been established that telomere shortening, which is the major contributor <b>to</b> telomere <b>uncapping,</b> is stress dependent and largely caused by a telomere-specific DNA single-strand break repair inefficiency. Secondly, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage is closely interrelated with mitochondrial ROS production, and this might also play a causal role for cellular senescence. Improvement of mitochondrial function results in less telomeric damage and slower telomere shortening, while telomere-dependent growth arrest is associated with increased mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, telomerase, the enzyme complex that is known to re-elongate shortened telomeres, also appears to have functions independent of telomeres that protect against oxidative stress. Together, these data suggest a self-amplifying cycle between mitochondrial and telomeric DNA damage during cellular senescence...|$|R

The Rnf 8 RING-finger domain is essential for Tpp 1 stability and retention at telomeres. Rnf 8 physically interacts with Tpp 1 to generate Ubc 13 -dependent Lys 63 polyubiquitin chains that stabilize Tpp 1 at telomeres. The conserved Tpp 1 residue Lys 233 is important for Rnf 8 -mediated Tpp 1 ubiquitylation and localization to telomeres.

40|$|We {{report the}} growth and {{characterization}} of InAs nanowires capped with a 0. 5 – 1 nm epitaxial InP shell. The low-temperature field-effect mobility is increased by a factor 2 – 5 compared to bare InAs nanowires. We extract the highest low-temperature peak electron mobilities obtained for nanowires to this date, exceeding 20 000 cm 2 V s? 1. The electron density in the nanowires, determined at zero gate voltage, is reduced by {{an order of magnitude}} compared <b>to</b> <b>uncapped</b> InAs nanowires. For smaller diameter nanowires we find an increase in electron density, which can be related to the presence of an accumulation layer at the InAs/InP interface. However, compared to the surface accumulation layer in uncapped InAs, this electron density is much reduced. We suggest that the increase in the observed field-effect mobility can be attributed to an increase of conduction through the inner part of the nanowire and a reduction of the contribution of electrons from the low-mobility accumulation layer. Furthermore the shell around the InAs reduces the surface roughness scattering and ionized impurity scattering in the nanowire. Kavli Institute of NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Exo 1 is a {{nuclease}} {{involved in}} mismatch repair, DSB repair, stalled replication fork processing {{and in the}} DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional telomeres. In budding yeast and mice, Exo 1 creates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at uncapped telomeres. This ssDNA accumulation activates the checkpoint response resulting in cell cycle arrest. Here, we demonstrate that Exo 1 is phosphorylated when telomeres are uncapped in cdc 13 - 1 and yku 70 Δ yeast cells, {{and in response to}} the induction of DNA damage. After telomere uncapping, Exo 1 phosphorylation depends on components of the checkpoint machinery such as Rad 24, Rad 17, Rad 9, Rad 53 and Mec 1, but is largely independent of Chk 1, Tel 1 and Dun 1. Serines S 372, S 567, S 587 and S 692 of Exo 1 were identified as targets for phosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation of these Exo 1 residues altered the DNA damage response <b>to</b> <b>uncapped</b> telomeres and camptothecin treatment, in a manner that suggests Exo 1 phosphorylation inhibits its activity. We propose that Rad 53 -dependent Exo 1 phosphorylation is involved in a negative feedback loop to limit ssDNA accumulation and DNA damage checkpoint activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{hygienic}} {{behavior of}} honey bees {{is based on}} a two-step process, including uncapping and removing diseased, dead, damaged, or parasitized brood inside the cell. We evaluated during periods of 1 h the time that hygienic and non-hygienic colonies of Africanized honey bees spend <b>to</b> detect, <b>uncap</b> and remove pin-killed brood using comb inserts with transparent walls placed in observation hives. We observed that hygienic colonies are significantly faster in detecting, uncapping and removing dead brood in the cells (P < 0. 001) ...|$|R
