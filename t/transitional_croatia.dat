40|$|In the 19 th and 20 th centuries the Christian social {{teaching}} or {{social teaching}} of the Church used to hold an important place in some Western countries, especially Germany and Austria. Without the rich tradition of the Christian social teaching {{it would have been}} hard to develop social market economy in Germany. In the transitional turmoil in Croatia the question about significance and meaning of the social {{teaching of the}} Church is inevitable. This paper, entitled Social Teaching of the Church in Croatia, does not aim at giving a complete picture of the social teaching of the Church in Croatia, does not aim at giving a complete picture of the social teaching of the Church in Croatia but highlights the main features of the activities undertaken by Christians and the Church in the public life of the <b>transitional</b> <b>Croatia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Social theorist Jürgen Habermas {{describes}} {{the public sphere}} as a network for communicating information and perspectives that creates public opinion, a network which is neither of the state, nor of private economic and household life. The ideal public sphere is a rational communicative process allowing participation in political and scholarly debates towards finding agreement, where speakers and addressees need not talk about themselves. Habermas does not blur the line between public and private; the two complement each other instead. Intersubjectivities reach consensus [...] -or achieve what journalism calls 2 ̆ 2 professional objectivity 2 ̆ 2. ^ Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork conducted from 1999 to 2003 and contextualized with historical sources, this dissertation explores these Habermasian ideals with data from the everyday life of Croatian journalists, important participants in transforming their post-socialist, post-war nation-state. Using broad strokes, the public sphere model is useful to describe <b>transitional</b> <b>Croatia,</b> but, {{when we look at}} the fine grains of the everyday lifeworld and put the newsroom in the wider context of culture, the communicative rationality of the journalistic milieu is not just the complementarity of the public and private, but the complicative, as well. ^ The concept of the public sphere is a useful analytic descriptor for institutional creatures with a 2 ̆ 2 monolithic 2 ̆ 2 identity as 2 ̆ 2 journalist 2 ̆ 2. Ethnography, however, shows us journalists as individuals [...] -individuals with sanguine and affinal ties, with organizational and associative pulls, with overt and covert identities. As I tell the stories of Croatian broadcast reporters and consider their ever-evolving subject matter (in this case, the Croatian presidency), I describe molecular variables of the journalistic field within wider cultural articulations. I find the concept of the public sphere needs to include a rhizomic model of communication, where uncentered connections are made or broken at any given spot, with interruptions and new networking happening at any occasion. As planes of communication mediate between structured orderly thinking on the one hand and the chaos of chance happenings and the complexity of their ever-shifting origins and outcomes on the other, Habermas 2 ̆ 7 modernist attempts to find the normative place in communicative rationality are fleeting when working from the ground up in the Croatian journalistic milieu. ...|$|E

The author investigates {{influences}} of globalization processes of enlargement of banks of foreign proprietary origin and international significance {{on a small}} <b>transitional</b> market of <b>Croatia.</b> Comprehensions that the paper brings can be abridged in following lines. First, globalization processes transformed banking system of Croatia from predominantly state to the system of foreign proprietary groups {{with a high level}} of concentration without bigger share or significance of central bank. Second, legal solutions were favourable for enlargement of banks and integration processes. Third, motifs and interests of foreign proprietary oligarchies in Croatia are directed to enlargement of profit and taking possession of better positions just before market integration of Europe. Fourth, the size and availability, and especially the price of crediting Croatian firms had no adequate quality in regard to development necessities of <b>transitional</b> economy of <b>Croatia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Globalization has {{increased}} competition which has shortened the {{product life cycle}} forcing firms to integrate product development with development of technologies (Bhalla, 1987; Drejer, 2000). Due to these global pressures, technology management has gained increased attention in the research environment. Unfortunately, {{there appears to be}} very little consensus on what technology management actually is. This research illustrates the differences between R&D management, management of technology and technological management. Also, the process that integrates the impact of technology on management functions with the other traditional managerial activities to identify and exploit business opportunities is described utilizing an interdisciplinary vision and multidisciplinary approach. The findings are presented in the <b>transitional</b> economy of <b>Croatia</b> with a focus on technology management in the context of global competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Secondary school {{students}} in six <b>transitional</b> economies, Belarus, <b>Croatia,</b> Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine, along with students in the USA, were surveyed about academic cheating. Regardless of geographic location, a substantial majority of all students {{reported that they had}} cheated on an exam or course assignment. In general, however, the percentages of students who reported that they had cheated and that they would assist others to cheat were higher in the transitional economies than in the USA. A bivariate probit regression model was estimated to determine the factors that contribute to the probability of cheating. The results indicated that the most consistently significant determinants were personal beliefs about the ethics and social acceptability of cheating and various attributes of the classroom environment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the self-rated {{subjective}} welfare of the individual in the case of Croatia, a country which has recently undergone both a transitional process as well as a war with its neighbouring countries. The subjective welfare is different from objective welfare, which is commonly defined by income and the difference is first explored through objective and subjective profiles of poverty. The largest difference between the two measures is found among the ones not objectively poor. The determinants of subjective welfare are analyzed in an ordered probit model by the following groups (i) objective variables of personal or household circumstances, (ii) measures of relative income, compared with different reference groups and (iii) attitudinal variables such as future expectations. The results show that, apart from absolute income, relative income is a strong determinant as well as a set of attitudinal variables. This can be connected to the <b>transitional</b> heritage of <b>Croatia</b> and is also in line with what has been found in other countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Croatian Health Survey was the assessment of population health related {{quality of life in}} the <b>transitional</b> enviroment of <b>Croatia.</b> Health status measures incorporate dimensions such as physical, psychological, and social functioning, role performance and perception of wellbeing. In order to assess health status, »The medical outcome study 36 -item short-form health survey (SF- 36) model« was used. A total sample of 5048 inhabitants (1983 males and 3065 females), 18 years and over, represents approximately 1 ‰ of the general population of Croatia. Mean scores were as follows: physical functioning (PF) 69. 94, role-physical (RP) 63. 01, bodily pain (BP) 64. 51, general health (GH) 53. 40, vitality (VT) 51. 85, social functioning (SF) 72. 96, role-emotional (RE) 72. 42, mental health (MH) 61. 71 and health transition (HT) 44. 79. Results of the SF- 36 health survey in Croatia are very much like the results in other European countries with indication that general quality of life is lower in Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Urban planning, {{renewal and}} their actors are always closely {{connected}} with the sociopolitical changes and therefore the <b>transitional</b> post- socialist <b>Croatia</b> provides an interesting context {{for the analysis of}} spatial changes. This paper is a comparative study of urban transformations in Croatia (the City of Zagreb) in three important time periods: (a) socialism in the 1970 s and the 1980 s, (b) period during and immediately after the Homeland War and the beginning of transition from 1990 to 2000 and (c) period since 2000 and the acceleration of processes which started in the previous period. These periods of time have been chosen because of major changes in the socio- political system and consequently in spatial planning and management. Also in each of them we can observe the changing power of different types of actors and the appearance of new actors. The main aspects of urban planning are determined as well as the power of various urban actors throughout each period. Since 1990 and especially since 2000 urban planning has been given little attention in Zagreb resulting in the disappearance of system or method and thus in sporadic, random building...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, Bangladeshi banker and {{economist}} Dr. Muhammad Yunus designed microcrediting – a socially sensitive and rightful system of fighting poverty and high unemployment rates. His Grameen Bank for {{the poorest of}} the poor in Bangladesh has so far lifted more than 3. 2 million of individuals and their families out of poverty. After initial successes at home, microcredit was put into service for reducing unemployment and alleviating poverty in numerous countries throughout the world. 	This paper explores specific problems that a typical <b>transitional</b> country (like <b>Croatia),</b> is likely to face, with unemployment – the source of a vast number of related problems in a transitional society – as the focal point. The authors have attempted to incorporate particularities of a transitional economy into the original microcrediting principles. As a solution to problems afflicting the domestic economy, the authors define a global microcrediting system framework on the macroeconomic level, assuming at the same time that microcrediting of socially vulnerable groups can resolve many problems of modern transitional societies. Arising from the authors' primary intention – to consider in depth the functionality of microcrediting in general transition conditions – a transitional microcrediting system has been defined in general terms, and a corresponding financial and mathematical model developed...|$|R

Na osnovi toga zaključak je autora da jetranzicijska kriza u Hrvatskoj znatno dublja nego u ostalim naprednijim tranzicijskim zemljama. Razlog je tome neadekvatna makroekonomska politika,posebno u monetarno-kreditnom i bankarskom sustavu. Zaključak je autora daje potreban zaokret u makroekonomskoj politici, posebno monetarno-kreditnoj, u Republici Hrvatskoj. The article {{comparatively}} {{estimates the}} achieved transition level of Croatian economy. The recovery of economy and growth dynamics are the estimate criteria of transitional process efficiency. Based {{on this is}} concluded that <b>transitional</b> crisis in <b>Croatia</b> is considerably deeper than in other more progressive transitional countries. The {{reason for this is}} in adequate macroeconomic policy, especially in monetary-credit and baking system. Privatization, as the element of institutional restructuring policy connected with macroeconomic policy (fiscaland monetary), is an additional cause of profundity and continuance of economic recession. The conclusion of the analysis is that exclusive reliance of our development strategy upon the policy of institutional restructuring and rigid policy of macroeconomic stabilizationin the form of stable nominal rate, initiated asymmetry inside development strategy. Since institutional restructuring in our country does not lag behind developed transitional countries, and development results are considerably inefficient, it arises conclusion of necessary shift to macroeconomic policy, esepecially monetary-credit. That would eliminate asymmetry in development strategy and achieve results like other more progressive transitional countries did...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco is {{the largest}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse several health and economically related indicators of tobacco consumption: smoking prevalence, standardized death rates (SDRs) from lung cancer and the proportion of GDP spent on tobacco in <b>Croatia</b> and other <b>transitional</b> countries - the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria. The overall smoking prevalence in Croatia decreased by 5. 2 % during 1994 - 2005, more among females (- 9. 9 %) than males (- 0. 3 %). There is no significant difference in the smoking prevalence between Croatia (27. 4 %) and other countries. However, 33. 8 % of Croatian males smoked during 2002 - 2005, more than in Romania and the Czech Republic, and less than in Hungary and Poland. The prevalence of female smoking (21. 7 %) in Croatia is similar to the female smoking prevalence in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, but male smoking is predominant in all countries. The proportion of smokers among youth is above 20 % and it is the highest in the Czech Republic (29. 7 %), followed by Hungary (26. 7 %), Slovenia (24. 9 %), Croatia (24. 1 %), and Poland (21. 5 %). The proportion of smokers among girls is higher than among boys in Slovenia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Croatia, contrary to Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland where boys smoke slightly more. There is no significant difference between the prevalence of smoking among girls in Croatia and Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Slovakia. According to the SDR from lung cancer in males (70. 3 / 100, 000), Croatia is ranked high assuming the 3 rd place, after Hungary (99. 7) and Poland (72. 0). With a SDR of 15. 9 / 100, 000 for females, Croatia is ranked slightly better [...] 5 th place. Tobacco consumption continues to be a major public health problem in <b>transitional</b> countries. <b>Croatia</b> conducted several campaigns and programmes in the past. However, results reveal that current anti-tobacco strategies are ineffective in reducing the smoking prevalence among men and youth. Men do not smoke less than a decade ago and, despite the observed decline among women, increasing trends are observed among teenage girls. Croatia should apply a comprehensive approach that would include raising awareness of health risks, restriction of smoking in public places, higher taxing, implementing stricter bans on advertising and promotion of tobacco as well as supporting smoking cessation. This last measure is believed to bring about some results in the medium term in targeted population groups, provided that it is supported by all health professionals. Otherwise, we may expect progress at the population level in the field of social stigmatization of smoking and wider intolerance to second-hand smoke. The full impact of smoking on the population health is yet to be seen and in the future it will undoubtedly remain one of the major contributors to the poor public health situation in Croatia...|$|R

The {{subject of}} {{the paper is the}} {{analysis}} of wages trends in <b>transitional</b> period in <b>Croatia</b> and consideration of macroeconomic implications of several possible scenarios of future wages development. Such analysis should help the bearers of economic policy in defining main principles of wage policy in the forthcoming years. The increase of wages supply after 1994 was the main originator of personal consumption growth and one of the main factors of entire economic growth in the following years. Expenditures for public sector wages were increasing their share in any how strongly growing entire government expenditure. Growing domestic consumption also caused remarkable deficits of current account and growing foreign borrowing. Sustainable economic growth on these bases is not possible in Croatia any more. Therefore it has been considered what can be done in wage policy in order to change that. In the first part the paper gives the analysis of condition, both of entire economic and of wages themselves. It shows comparisons of wages trends and other macroeconomic indicators during the period of time, international comparisons of levels of wages and their purchasing power, as well asanalysis of wages by sectors, and tax burden of wages. The second part shows implications of four possible scenarios of wages trends in following years. Depending on variant chosen by economic policy bearers or agreed upon by social partners, the results are different in view of economic growth, deficit, balance of payments, rates of investment, national savings and employment. Projections show that growth of wages which lags behind the GDP growth improves entire economic efficiency of economy. Stronger restriction of wages and employment in public sector accelerates economic growth but has short-term cost in the form of strongly growing unemployment. If private sector integrates with public in wage policy according to which average wages would grow more slowly than the growth of productivity, entire economic efficiency would be higher than if such policy is conducted only by public sector...|$|R
