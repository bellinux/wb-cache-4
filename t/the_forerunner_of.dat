5|$|Bewick is {{best known}} for his A History of British Birds, which is admired today mainly for its wood engravings, {{especially}} the small, sharply observed, and often humorous vignettes known as tail-pieces.

5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} {{remained}} relatively small, no longer ranking {{among the major}} cities of Korea.

5|$|After 1931 the OSP {{suffered}} {{the effects of}} the Great Depression; much of its funding ceased, and the orchestra reformed itself into a co-operative, pooling such meagre profits as it made. To give the players some extra work Monteux started a series of conducting classes in 1932. From 1936 he held the classes at his summer home in Les Baux in Provence, <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> the school he later set up in the US.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1853 Markham needed paid employment, and in December 1853 secured a junior clerkship in the Legacy Duty Office of the Inland Revenue at a salary of £90 per annum (around £6,000 in 2008). He found the work tedious, but after six months was able to {{transfer}} to <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> what became, in 1857, the India Office.

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, McNary {{supported}} the development of federal hydroelectric power dams, and in 1933, he introduced legislation {{that led to the}} building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as public works projects. He voted for the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> the farm legislation of the New Deal.|$|E

5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> {{the electric}} clock, the electrostatic clock.

5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (<b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.|$|E

5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E
5|$|After Leane's {{retirement}} {{as police}} commissioner, he briefly continued {{his work with}} the VDC, resigning on 30 July 1944. He was knighted in the 1945 King's birthday honours for his services as police commissioner over a 24 year period. For his service with the VDC during World War II he was issued with the War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945. In 1946, he became the inaugural president of the Plympton branch of the conservative Liberal and Country League, <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> the state Liberal Party. He continued to lead the Adelaide Anzac Day March each year, and on 7 September 1946 was invested with his knighthood by the Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, <b>the</b> <b>forerunner</b> <b>of</b> modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
