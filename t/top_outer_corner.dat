40|$|Abstract—Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) is {{currently}} being widely investigated because of its potential to produce ultrafine grained microstructures in metals and alloys. A sound knowledge of the plastic deformation and strain distribution is necessary for understanding the relationships between strain inhomogeneity and die geometry. Considerable research has been reported on finite element analysis of this process, assuming threedimensional plane strain condition. However, the two-dimensional models are not suitable due to the geometry of the dies, especially in cylindrical ones. In the present work, three-dimensional simulation of ECAP process was carried out for six <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> radii (sharp to 10 mm in steps of 2 mm), with channel angle 105 �, for strain hardening aluminium alloy (AA 6101) using ABAQUS/Standard software.

The acoustical performance of a numerical method based on the non-linear Euler equations for two-dimensional inviscid and compressible flows is checked and its ability to predict the response of 3 D-bends is investigated. The comparison between 2 -D and 3 -D data is made for equal dimensionless frequencies f/fc where f is the frequency of the acoustical perturbations and fc is the cut-off frequency of the bends. In the case of a bend with a sharp inner edge and a sharp <b>outer</b> <b>corner,</b> the 2 -D numerical predictions agree with 2 -D analytical data obtained from a mode expansion technique and with 2 -D experimental data from literature and our own 3 -D experimental results.

40|$|The aeroacoustical {{response}} of 90 degree sharp bends {{is defined as}} the response to acoustical perturbations {{in the presence of a}} main flow. The acoustical {{response of}} bends, in the absence of a main flow, has been considered in part I [1]. Experiments are carried out for bends in pipes with circular cross-sections. These 3 D-bends have a sharp inner edge and have either a sharp <b>outer</b> <b>corner</b> or a rounded outer wall. The three-dimensional experimental results are compared with results of numerical simulations, based on the Euler equations for two-dimensional inviscid and compressible flows, and with analytical data obtained by means of two-dimensional quasi-steady flow theories. As observed in the absence of a main flow (part I [1]), the two-dimensional numerical simulations provide a good prediction of the aeroacoustical response of bends with a sharp inner edge and a sharp <b>outer</b> <b>corner.</b> For bends with a rounded <b>outer</b> <b>corner,</b> the prediction is less satisfactory. The two-dimensional quasi-steady flow approximation predicts reasonably well the response of bends up to Strouhal numbers of the order of unity. However, quasi-steady flow theories do not predict the irregularities of the response as a function of the flow velocity. These irregularities are expected to be a Strouhal number effect and are observed both in experiments and numerical simulations...|$|R
