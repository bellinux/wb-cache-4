40|$|In this work, we {{demonstrate}} {{an environmentally}} benign and facile flash light irradiation process to reduce graphene oxide (GO). GO thin films were prepared by a vacuum filtration process, and these films were reduced by exposure <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation {{for a few}} milliseconds at room temperature under ambient conditions. Flash light conditions such as energy, pulse width, and pulse number were varied to determine optimal conditions for this photothermal reduction of GO. The flash light irradiation treatment completely reduced the GO thin films, transforming them into pure graphene films. The resulting graphene films were characterized by x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis.

40|$|Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) {{channels}} are encoded by four genes (HCN 1 - 4) and are widely {{expressed in the}} central and peripheral nervous system and in cardiac tissues. All types of HCN {{channels are}} also expressed in the retina. Due to their rapid activation, HCN 1 channels, which are expressed most abundantly in the inner segments of the photoreceptors, are particularly well suited to modulate retinal responses <b>to</b> <b>flashed</b> <b>light</b> or background light. In vivo functional analysis of HCN 1 knockout mice using electroretinography has shown that HCN 1 channels shorten retinal light responses under scotopic conditions and thus {{play an important role}} for the responsiveness to high-frequency repetitive stimuli.

40|$|The {{stimulus}} {{characteristics of}} lights that might aid a pilot {{to see and}} avoid, by alerting him to a potential threat were studied. The relative conspicuity of foveally equated, point-source, steady and <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> of several brightnesses, seen against a star background was examined. From the subject's viewpoint, these target lights could appear anywhere within a large (40 deg horizontal by 35 deg vertical) field of view. The lights appeared at random time intervals while the subject was periodically distracted by a simulated cockpit task. The results indicate that correct target detection increases and reaction time decreases with increased target intensity. Steady lights are missed more frequently and acquired more slowly than <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> but no significant differences are found among {{the wide range of}} flash rates employed. The intensity of the light has a greater effect on both detection and reaction time to steady <b>lights</b> than <b>to</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> These results are compared with results of other researchers who used targets which appeared at fixed locations. The longest reaction times were recorded to lights which appeared either at the extremes or {{at the very center of}} the visual field...|$|R
40|$|The {{swimming}} {{movement of}} Cryptomonas sp. cells generates a helical path, {{as a result}} of rotations with an average period of 500 milliseconds. When a <b>flash</b> of <b>light</b> at 570 nanometers for 20 microseconds was applied unidirectionally at intervals of 500 milliseconds, only a fixed side of each rotating cell was repeatedly exposed <b>to</b> the <b>flashes</b> of <b>light.</b> The relationship between the irradiated side of a cell and the phototactic orientation of the cell, rotating with a period of 475 to 525 milliseconds, was determined by infrared videomicrography. Only when the ventral sides of the cells were exposed <b>to</b> the <b>flashes</b> of <b>light</b> did their courses shift predominantly toward the light source. This result suggests that light is efficiently detected by the ventral side of these organisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} strychnine and the GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline upon the discharge pattern of center- surround-organized cat retinal ganglion cells of X and Y type were studied. Stimuli (mostly scotopic, and some photopic) were selected such that responses from {{both on and}} off-center cells were either due to the center, due to the surround, or clearly mixed. Pre-drug control responses were obtained, and their behavior following administration of the antagonists was observed for periods up to several hours. X-cell responses were affected in a consistent manner by strychnine while being unaffected by GABA antagonists. All observed changes following strychnine were consistent with a shift in center-surround balance of X cells {{in favor of the}} center. For Y-cell responses <b>to</b> <b>flashing</b> annuli following strychnine, there was either no shift or a relatively small shift in center-surround balance. Compared to X-cell responses <b>to</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> those of Y cells were very little affected by strychnine and in most cases were unaffected.

40|$|Light has {{direct effects}} on sleep and {{wakefulness}} causing arousal in diurnal animals {{and sleep in}} nocturnal animals. In the present study, we assessed the modulation of light-induced sleep by melanopsin and the histaminergic system by exposing mice <b>to</b> millisecond <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> and continuous <b>light</b> respectively. First, we show that the induction of sleep by millisecond <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> is dose dependent {{as a function of}} <b>light</b> <b>flash</b> number. We found that exposure <b>to</b> 60 <b>flashes</b> of <b>light</b> occurring once every 60 seconds for 1 -h (120 -ms of total light over an hour) induced a similar amount of sleep as a continuous bright light pulse. Secondly, the induction of sleep by millisecond <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> was attenuated in the absence of melanopsin when animals were presented with flashes occurring every 60 seconds over a 3 -h period beginning at ZT 13. Lastly, the acute administration of a histamine H 3 autoreceptor antagonist, ciproxifan, blocked the induction of sleep by a 1 -h continuous light pulse during the dark period. Ciproxifan caused a decrease in NREMS delta power and an increase in theta activity during both sleep and wake periods respectively. The data suggest that some form of temporal integration occurs in response <b>to</b> millisecond <b>light</b> <b>flashes,</b> and that this process requires melanopsin photoreception. Furthermore, the pharmacological data suggest that the increase of histaminergic neurotransmission is sufficient to attenuate the light-induced sleep response during the dark period.
