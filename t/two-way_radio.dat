5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> {{contact with}} the Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with Brasilia Center. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the concern for}} Wireless Local Area Network devices and <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> to cause electromagnetic interference to aircraft navigation radio systems. Spurious radiated emissions from various IEEE 802. 11 a, 802. 11 b, and Bluetooth devices are characterized using reverberation chambers. The results are compared with baseline emissions from standard laptop computer and personal digital assistants (PDAs) that are currently allowed for use on aircraft. The {{results indicate that the}} WLAN devices tested are not more of a threat to aircraft navigation radios than standard laptop computers and PDAs in most aircraft bands. In addition, spurious radiated emission data from seven pairs of <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> are provided. These <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> emit at much higher levels in the bands considered.

25|$|On 10 April Phillips {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the lifeboat, but was recaptured after the captors fired shots. The pirates then threw a phone and a <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> dropped to them by the U.S. Navy into the ocean, fearing the Americans were somehow using the equipment to give instructions to the captain. The United States dispatched another warship, amphibious assault ship , to the site off the Horn of Africa. The pirates' strategy was to link up with their comrades, who were holding various other hostages, and to get Phillips to Somalia where they could hide him and make a rescue more difficult for the Americans. Anchoring near shore would allow them to land quickly if attacked. Negotiations were ongoing between the pirates and the captain of Bainbridge and FBI hostage negotiators. The captors were also communicating with other pirate vessels by satellite phone.|$|E

40|$|Measurement processes, {{data and}} {{analysis}} are provided {{to address the}} concern for Wireless Local Area Network devices and <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> to cause electromagnetic interference to aircraft navigation radio systems. A radiated emission measurement process is developed and spurious radiated emissions from various devices are characterized using reverberation chambers. Spurious radiated emissions in aircraft radio frequency bands from several wireless network devices are compared with baseline emissions from standard computer laptops and personal digital assistants. In addition, spurious radiated emission data in aircraft radio frequency bands from seven pairs of <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> are provided, A description of the measurement process, device modes of operation and the measurement results are reported. Aircraft interference path loss measurements were conducted on four Boeing 747 and Boeing 737 aircraft for several aircraft radio systems. The measurement approach is described and the path loss results are compared with existing data from reference documents, standards, and NASA partnerships. In-band on-channel interference thresholds are compiled from an existing reference document. Using these data, a risk assessment is provided for interference from wireless network devices and <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> to aircraft systems, including Localizer, Glideslope, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range, Microwave Landing System and Global Positioning System. The report compares the interference risks associated with emissions from wireless network devices and <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> against standard laptops and personal digital assistants. Existing receiver interference threshold references are identified as to require more data for better interference risk assessments...|$|R

25|$|Alpine {{is home to}} {{the tower}} and {{laboratory}} built by Edwin Howard Armstrong after RCA evicted him from the Empire State Building. Armstrong's experimental FM station, W2XMN, used various frequencies to broadcast from the tower, first on 42.8 MHz; later on 44.1MHz; and finally on 93.1MHz in the modern FM band. The laboratory building and the tower still stand; the 400-foot (122-m) tower is home to many <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> users, one modern FM station (Fairleigh Dickinson University's WFDU), and backup transmitters for several of New York's television stations. The tower served as a primary tower for the stations after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Center. There was some local opposition to this scheme, but the move was temporary, as the stations affected moved their primary broadcast facilities to the Empire State Building. The original lab building is home to a static display of historic communications equipment and offices; the USA Network cable channel operated from this building in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard LORAN {{maritime}} navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate <b>two-way</b> <b>radio.</b> The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.|$|E
