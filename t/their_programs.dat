5|$|The Bloomberg Businessweek rankings, {{which are}} based on three sources of data (a student survey, a survey of {{corporate}} recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating), are published in mid-October of even numbered years. The 2006 student survey of 45 online questions of students' ratings of <b>their</b> <b>programs</b> was distributed to 16,595 students three weeks before graduation; there were 9,290 responses. The recruiter survey determines how many MBAs a recruiter's company hired in the previous two years and which schools it actively recruits from. 223 respondents participated out of 426 solicited. The intellectual capital is determined based on a formula incorporating academic publications in journals, books written, and faculty size.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} limited affirmative action {{programmes}} before. However, these mostly {{focused on the}} civil service, as Article 153 of the Constitution did. Admission to higher education was largely merit-based. The Tunku government preferred laissez-faire policies, minimising economic intervention. Although some agencies, such as the Rural Industrial Development Agency (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs, existed, <b>their</b> <b>programs</b> were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.|$|E

5|$|Titan is {{available}} for any scientific purpose; access depends {{on the importance of}} the project and its potential to exploit the hybrid architecture. Any selected programs must also be executable on other supercomputers to avoid sole dependence on Titan. Six vanguard programs were the first selected. They dealt mostly with molecular scale physics or climate models, while 25 others were queued behind them. The inclusion of GPUs compelled authors to alter <b>their</b> <b>programs.</b> The modifications typically increased the degree of parallelism, given that GPUs offer many more simultaneous threads than CPUs. The changes often yield greater performance even on CPU-only machines.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, Snow {{had a couple of}} months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked {{the first time in the}} history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of <b>their</b> <b>programs</b> and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying <b>their</b> <b>programs.</b> Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

5|$|A smaller player {{than his}} peers – St. Louis was listed at five feet nine inches tall in college – he often {{struggled}} to gain recognition for his ability. He was {{passed over for}} a provincial team at a midget age tournament despite leading his league in scoring, while major junior teams showed little interest in him. He was heavily recruited by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools to play for <b>their</b> <b>programs,</b> however. He played one season of junior A hockey with the Hawkesbury Hawks of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL) in 1992–93 where he scored 37 goals and 87 points in just 31 games. The University of Vermont Catamounts convinced St. Louis to join their hockey program. He had 51 points in 33 games in his freshman season of 1993–94 and {{was named to the}} East Coast Athletic Conference's All-Rookie Team.|$|E
5|$|Singing {{schools in}} Baltimore were {{few in number}} until the 1830s. Singing masters began {{incorporating}} secular music into their curriculum, and divested themselves from sponsoring churches, {{in the early part}} of the 1830s. Attendance increased drastically, especially after the founding of two important institutions: the Academy, established in 1834 by Ruel Shaw, and the Musical Institute, founded by John Hill Hewitt and William Stoddard. The Academy and the Institute quickly became rivals, and both gave successful performances. Some Baltimore singing masters used new terminology to describe <b>their</b> <b>programs,</b> as the term singing school was falling out of favor; Alonzo Cleaveland founded the Glee School during this era, focusing entirely on secular music. In contrast, religious musical instruction by the middle of the 19th century remained based around itinerant singing masters who taught for a period of time, then continued to new locations.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Marriage Protection Act was reintroduced to the General Assembly on January 23, 2012. The {{new version}} of the bill {{contained}} provisions that more explicitly protects religious leaders, institutions, and <b>their</b> <b>programs</b> from legal action if they refuse to officiate or provide facilities for a same-sex marriage or couple as a matter of their doctrine. During the legislative process, several high-profile political figures attempted to persuade legislators to vote in favor of the bill, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Terry McAuliffe, and Ken Mehlman. The House of Delegates passed the bill with a 72–67 vote on February 17, 2012 and the Senate passed with a 25–22 vote on February 23, 2012. To secure support from some lawmakers who desired to submit the law to public referendum, the bill was amended to take effect on January 1, 2013.|$|E

5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed <b>their</b> <b>programs.</b> In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E
