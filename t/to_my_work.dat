5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years. He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Welsh language, which Tolkien had learned, is summarized in his essay English and Welsh: [...] "If I may once more refer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>work.</b> The Lord of the Rings, in evidence: the names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of Welsh (closely similar but not identical).

40|$|Don’s {{work has}} been an {{inspiration}} {{to all of us}} who are interested in semigroups. None more so than in my case: reading through his list of publications, I realised that well over half had been essential <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>work.</b> So in <b>my</b> talk, I shall describe how Don inspired me.

2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. I had discovered that publicly performing my own work placed me in an exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe now that I was basically uncommitted <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions. [...] I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked. [...] When the audience and my peers turned on me, I picked up my marbles and went home. [...] I just decided to stop making work.|$|E
