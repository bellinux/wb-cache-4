5|$|In 1960, {{she visited}} India at the {{invitation}} of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who had been impressed by Princess Andrew's interest in Indian religious thought, and for her own spiritual quest. The trip was cut short when she unexpectedly took ill, and her sister-in-law, Edwina Mountbatten, who happened to be passing through Delhi on her own tour, had to smooth <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indian hosts who were taken aback at Princess Andrew's sudden change of plans. She later claimed she had had an out-of-body experience. Edwina continued her own tour, and died the following month.|$|E

Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|Kate tells Erin about Rhys' plan, but he convinces Erin that Kate is {{a jealous}} ex-girlfriend who is lying. Erin {{believes}} {{him and they}} have dinner together. Rhys pours wine on her shirt sleeve and at the hospital, he implies to Karl that Erin has a drinking problem. She quits the surgical program and Rhys asks Jessica if he can take her place. Karl realises he has been used and Rhys takes him to visit Elaine, {{to try to make}} him understand what getting on the program means to him. Elaine reveals she has spinal degeneration and Karl remarks that Rhys cannot help her. Rhys explains that he wants to help the next person to develop the condition. Rhys sits an exam on the material he has missed and Jessica allows him join the surgical program. Rhys makes a bet with Kate that he can seduce Jade, but when he goes to kiss her, Jade rejects him. Rhys' mother asks if she can visit him and Rhys tells her he is working over Easter. When they run into Jade and Kyle, Rhys does not introduce them to Elaine and she accuses him of being ashamed of her. Rhys then takes Elaine to meet Martin, who reveals he failed his surgical program interview. Elaine accuses him of lying to her and being like his father. Rhys denies this and Elaine tells him to fix <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> people he has hurt.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{vision of}} {{economics}} {{is that it}} cannot be unhinged from ideas about the individual and social life. Human activity and political organization must be incorporated into any analysis of trade and economies. In remaking the discipline, he calls {{for a return to}} the normative practice of classical economics but stripped of its necessitarian assumptions and typological references. The development of explanatory claims and prescriptive ideas are necessary. The discipline must connect the transformation of nature with that of society—the making of <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reorganization of people.|$|E

25|$|In a twelve-a-side {{match at}} The Parks, Oxford, a strong Bangladesh A side {{including}} nine internationals {{went down to}} a combined universities side, admittedly including two current county professionals. Bangladesh A batted first, and made 249 for 6 in their 50 overs, Nafees Iqbal top-scoring with 109, while young prodigy Mushfiqur Rahim also made 50. Bangladesh A proceeded to gift away 35 extras - including 21 in wides - which probably cost them the match, as the Universities passed their score with ten balls remaining. Talha Jubair and Abdur Razzak showed promising <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball, though, taking four for 50 and two for 37 respectively.|$|E
25|$|After a {{reluctance}} {{of the military}} to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock {{of the next day}} from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that {{marked the beginning of the}} First Republic. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag. The revolution produced some civil and religious liberties, although there was no advance in women's rights and in workers rights, unlike what happened in other European countries.|$|E

This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> value, and another <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children.|$|R

500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said {{he thought}} the episode was an improvement over the pilot episode, which he also enjoyed. Sepinwall said the episode seemed to distance the Leslie character from Michael Scott, Steve Carell's character on The Office, and gave more for the supporting cast to do; he particularly praised Schneider and Ansari. Matt Fowler of IGN said Amy Poehler [...] "remains frighteningly unflappable" [...] and said he enjoyed how disastrous the town hall meeting turned out to be, but said supporting characters like Mark and Ron [...] "need to be fleshed out a bit more and made... well, funnier." [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune said [...] "Canvassing" [...] was funnier than the pilot episode, but still lacked big laughs and [...] "I think the writers can do some interesting <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whole playground plot, among them introducing us to some of Pawnee's more colorful denizens." ...|$|E

500|$|Kreisberg {{described}} the crossover between both shows as [...] "a superhero a-go-go!", saying: [...] "It’s insane {{to have them}} all together." [...] Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: [...] "This [...] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really feels like a 2-hour movie [...] over two nights." [...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash have a pretty big jaw-dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow. Then we do some <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major." ...|$|E

He commented on Fanning's [...] "commanding and {{distinctive}} vocals", the [...] "twin-guitar attack" [...] of Middleton and Haug, Collins' [...] "innovative basslines", and the [...] "powerhouse drum work" [...] of Coghill. Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as [...] "Powderfinger back to its essence.

Although at least none of Weatherfield's men folk have charged ladies for their company, as, despite his plummy veneer, Lewis is just a gigolo." [...] In March 2012, Stephen wrote that Lewis is [...] "charm personified, {{even if he is}} a reformed fraudster." [...] A writer for the Liverpool Daily Post wrote, [...] "Since Lewis (Nigel Havers) waltzed into the street, <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> over fifty club (Rita, Audrey and now Deirdre) haven't been the same."

500|$|The European {{coronation}} ceremonies of the Middle Ages {{were essentially}} {{a combination of}} the Christian rite of anointing with additional elements. Following Europe's conversion to Christianity, crowning ceremonies became more and more ornate, depending on the country in question, and their Christian elements—especially anointing—became the paramount concern. Crowns and sceptres, used in coronations since ancient times, took on a Christian significance together with the orb as symbols of the purported divine order of <b>things,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> monarch as the divinely ordained overlord and protector of his dominion. During the Middle Ages, this rite was considered so vital in some European kingdoms that it was sometimes referred to as an [...] "eighth sacrament". The anointed ruler was viewed as a mixta persona, part priest and part layman, but never wholly either. This notion persisted into the twentieth century in Imperial Russia, where the Tsar was considered to be [...] "wedded" [...] to his subjects through the Orthodox coronation service. Coronation stones marked the site of some medieval ceremonies, though some alleged stones are later inventions.|$|E

Next Saturday, she decides to take Bart and Lisa to an [...] "X-Games" [...] convention, thinking it will be something fun. However, when they arrive, they are disappointed {{to find out that}} it is a Christian event, and the actual name of the convention is [...] "† Games". The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia, where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food. Although initially averse to the exotic food, Marge is reminded that she wants to be a fun mom and therefore asks for the most authentic dish on the menu for her and her children. All three of them enjoy the food. At the restaurant, Marge, Bart, and Lisa bump into a group of foodies, who encourage them to start their own food blog, [...] "The Three Mouthketeers". The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and writing about it. This leaves Homer feeling left out and sad.|$|E
500|$|In 138 matches {{across the}} five seasons for Somerset, McCool made 7,913 runs {{at an average}} of 33.82. He also took 219 wickets at 28.05 but in his five years with the county he was never the first-choice spin bowler: in his first two seasons, Somerset used Australian-born slow left-arm {{orthodox}} bowler John McMahon as the main spin bowler, with young off-spin bowler Brian Langford also bowling more than McCool. When McMahon left, Langford took over as the top spin bowler, and by 1960 was bowling four times the number of overs that McCool took. But McCool had also lost some of his control at this stage: [...] "He could do beguiling <b>things</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball, though length and line seemed to become a decreasing consideration," [...] says the history of Somerset cricket. He also made 146 catches, many of them at first slip, where he stood [...] "rather deeper than usual". His influence on Somerset's recovery from the trough of the early 1950s was considerable. A later Somerset history says: [...] "Occasionally some of the younger pros didn't relish the way he treated them. Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own. But their respect for his competitive approach and sheer experience was undeniable." ...|$|E
