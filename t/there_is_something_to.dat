500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something...</b> <b>to</b> be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror. I think I scared the living shit out of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Lewis in Vanity Fair: [...] "Many of the {{articles}} attacking her accused her of making a very specific forecast — {{as many as a}} hundred defaults within a year! — that failed to materialize... But that's not at all what she had said: her words were being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make sure I had heard what I thought I had heard. She says <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E

The coming of Bernadine had steadied his nerves. His gun had come to his shoulder like the piston-rod of an engine. His eye was clear, his nerve still. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done! Decidedly, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done!...|$|R

2500|$|The Anime Essentials {{anthology}} by Gilles Poitras {{describes it}} as a [...] "complex and somehow existential" [...] anime that [...] "pushed the envelope" [...] of anime diversity in the 1990s, alongside the much better known Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. Professor Susan J. Napier, in her 2003 reading to the American Philosophical Society called The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation (published 2005), compared Serial Experiments Lain to Ghost in the Shell and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. According to her, the main characters of the two other works cross barriers; they can cross back to our world, but Lain cannot. Napier asks whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> which Lain should return, [...] "between an empty 'real' and a dark 'virtual'". Mike Toole of Anime News Network named Serial Experiments Lain {{as one of the}} most important anime of the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the years}} of the Republic, Augustus claimed he [...] "found the city in brick and left it in marble". While chances are high that this was an exaggeration, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be said for the influx of marble use in Roman Forum from 63 BC onwards. During Augustus reign, the Forum was {{described}} to have been [...] "a larger, freer space than was the Forum of imperial times." [...] The Forum began to take on even more changes upon the arrival of Julius Casear who drew out extensive plans for the market hub. While Casear's death came prematurely, the ideas himself, as well as Augustus had in regards to the Forum proved to be the most influential for years to come. According to Walter Dennison's The Roman Forum As Cicero Saw It, the author writes that [...] "the diverting of public business to the larger and splendid imperial fora erected in the vicinity resulted in leaving the general design of the Forum Romanum".|$|E
