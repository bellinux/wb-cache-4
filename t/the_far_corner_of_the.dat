5|$|York moved {{two points}} above the relegation zone with a 3–0 away win over Cambridge, Fletcher giving York {{the lead on}} 43 minutes after {{collecting}} a loose ball {{on the edge of}} the penalty area and scoring with a powerful shot. Coulson scored soon after the second half began when his deep cross dropped into <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal, and Hyde finished the scoring in the 55th minute when diverting Fletcher's shot from inside the six-yard box. York went behind away to AFC Wimbledon when Deji Oshilaja scored a header in the 19th minute, before Hyde scored an equaliser after goalkeeper Joe McDonnell dropped Sinclair's cross in the 43rd minute. However, Jack Smith scored the winning goal for the home team with a volley in the 90th minute, meaning the match ended in a 2–1 win for AFC Wimbledon. Shaq Coulthirst, who scored Southend's winning goal against York in January, joined on loan from Tottenham Hotspur for the rest of the season, after Fletcher was ruled out for six weeks with a hamstring injury. York drew 0–0 at home to relegation rivals Carlisle, and the team's best chances came in the 74th minute when Coulson and Sinclair had shots cleared off the line. Having made nine appearances for York, Benning was recalled by Walsall due to an injury to Andy Taylor. Tom Soares scored early as York were beaten 1–0 at home by Bury, resulting in the team only being above the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E

500|$|The first close game of {{the season}} game in early November in a conference game against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in Minneapolis. In a game played in 35 minute halves at Athletic Field in Minneapolis, the Wolverines came away with the win by a score of 6–4. Michigan came within ten yards of a {{touchdown}} five minutes into the game but did not score. The first half ended in a scoreless tie. When Michigan scored its touchdown in the second half, Michigan fans in the bleachers signaled the event with cowbells. Michigan's touchdown was scored by fullback duffy and the goal after touchdown was kicked by Ferbert. Minnesota responded with a touchdown (worth 4 points under 1896 rules), but the score came at <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field where a straight kick for the goal after touchdown (worth 2 points) was impossible. Accordingly, Minnesota attempted a double kick, kicking the ball first to the fullback Loomis. Loomis caught the ball so close to the goal posts that his kick for goal [...] "was easily stopped by Michigan players." [...] The blocked kick was the difference in a close game. Michigan's lineup was Hutchins (right end), Henninger (right tackle), Bennett (right guard), Wombacher (center), Carr (left guard), Villa (left tackle), Farnham (left end), Felver (quarterback), Caley (right halfback), Ferbert (left halfback), and Hogg and Duff at fullback.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal faced West Ham United in {{the first}} weekend of October. Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Overmars were rested for the match, {{replaced}} by Oleh Luzhny, Slyvinho and Davor Šuker. In spite of general dominance from Arsenal, West Ham striker Paolo di Canio scored in each half to win his team the match. Patrick Vieira was dismissed during play for a foul on Di Canio. A confrontation soon after occurred between the player and Neil Ruddock. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. Šuker scored twice against Everton at Highbury on 16 October 1999. Arsenal then travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Goals from Tore André Flo and Dan Petrescu seemed to have given the home side victory, before Kanu scored a hat-trick {{in the space of}} 15 minutes. His first involved extending his legs and stabbing the ball past goalkeeper Ed de Goey, once it fell kindly in his direction. The equaliser came in the 83rd minute: Kanu received the ball from Overmars, which took him away from goal but hit the ball to the left of De Goey’s dive. In injury time Kanu, in the downpour, chased down the ball and dribbled past the stranded Chelsea goalkeeper on the byline, before curling the ball over Frank Leboeuf and into <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal net. Kanu's teammate Šuker described the third goal as [...] "beautiful", while Bergkamp added: [...] "The skills he has got, the moves he makes, are something you like to watch and learn from. I watch him in training and it is a joy." [...] The month ended with a goalless draw at home to Newcastle United, which left Arsenal fourth, three points behind league leaders Leeds United.|$|E
