5|$|The Colombian <b>tariff</b> <b>system</b> {{is defined}} in the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The <b>tariff</b> <b>system</b> aims at {{reconciling}} the achievement of cost recovery with {{the protection of the}} poor. The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{citizens}} who live in areas corresponding to classes 1–3 than {{those who live in}} the areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6. For example, in Bogotá 73% of the population live in zones of classes 1–3, whereas only 10% live in zones classified as 5 and 6. Consequently, the <b>tariff</b> <b>system</b> permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by the national government.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>system,</b> under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
40|$|High {{volume of}} data is {{gathered}} via sensors and recorded by smart meters. These data are processed at the electricity consumer and grid operators' side by big data analytics. Electricity consumption optimization offers multiple advantages for both consumers and grid operators. At the electricity customer level, by optimizing electricity consumption savings are significant, but the main benefits will come from indirect aspects such as avoiding onerous grid investments, higher volume of renewable energy sources' integration, less polluted environment etc. In order to optimize electricity consumption, advanced <b>tariff</b> <b>systems</b> are essential due to the financial incentive they provide for electricity consumers' behaviour change. In this paper several advanced <b>tariff</b> <b>systems</b> are described in details. These systems are applied in England, Spain, Italy, France, Norway and Germany. These systems are compared from characteristics, advantages/disadvantages point of view. Then, different <b>tariff</b> <b>systems</b> applied in Romania are presented. Romanian <b>tariff</b> <b>systems</b> have been designed for various electricity consumers' types. Different <b>tariff</b> <b>systems</b> applied by grid operators or electricity suppliers {{will be included in}} the database model that is part of an informatics system for electricity consumption optimization...|$|R

Leopold also abolished capital punishment. On 30November 1786, after having defacto blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished {{the death penalty and}} ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land.

25|$|With American {{corporate}} interests firmly rooted in Cuba, the U.S. <b>tariff</b> <b>system</b> was adjusted accordingly to strengthen {{trade between the}} nations. The Reciprocity Treaty of 1903 lowered the U.S. tariff on Cuban sugar by 20%. This gave Cuban sugar a competitive edge in the American marketplace. At the same time, it granted equal or greater concessions on most items imported from the United States. Cuban imports of American goods went from $17 million {{in the five years}} before the war, to $38 million in 1905, and eventually to over $200 million in 1918. Likewise, Cuban exports to the United States reached $86 million in 1905 and rose to nearly $300 million in 1918.|$|E

25|$|The phenomenal {{growth in}} trade slowed {{somewhat}} {{in the years}} after the recommencement of the Eighty Years' War with Spain in 1621 (the end of the Twelve Years' Truce). That recommencement offered the possibility of extending trade to the Western Hemisphere (indeed, the Dutch West India Company was founded in 1621), but elsewhere the Dutch were increasingly pushing up against European rivals in a struggle for market share. The competitive advantages of the more efficient Dutch shippers invited protectionist countermeasures, like the English Navigation Acts in the mid-17th century, the French <b>tariff</b> <b>system,</b> instituted under Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and similar protectionist measures instituted by Sweden at the same time. These protectionist measures caused a number of trade wars and military conflicts, like the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century, the Dutch-Swedish War, and the Franco-Dutch War (though the latter had a more general politico-military character, like the later conflicts between the Republic and France; these wars had an important economic component too, though).|$|E
25|$|The average water tariff {{reported}} in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure {{is not very}} indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block <b>tariff</b> <b>system</b> is in place for household connections. This means {{that for the first}} 10 m3 a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there are problems with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff.|$|E

Within the last 20 years several FIT designs have been implemented in the EU countries, leading to dynamically developing RES-E markets. This book investigates different feed-in tariff design options and describes their consequences for RES-E generators, investors and electricity consumers. Innovative solutions to reduce electricity generation costs, to promote certain technologies or to take into account local conditions of renewable energy sources are analysed. The author uses several examples from the Member States of the European Union to illustrate the different FIT options.

Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community – the [...] "main loser" [...] from the 1985 Tax Summit according to Paul Kelly – was the introduction of full dividend imputation, a reform insisted upon by Keating. Funding for schools was also considerably increased, while financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer.
