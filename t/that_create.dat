5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions <b>that</b> <b>create</b> significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions <b>that</b> <b>create</b> a steep temperature gradient.|$|E

The committee presented a slate of jobs-related legislation {{at the start of}} the 2009 session; one measure, sponsored by Rice, would offer tax credits to companies <b>that</b> <b>create</b> 20 jobs in urban areas or 10 jobs in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} <b>that</b> <b>create</b> hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei <b>that</b> <b>create</b> larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the dust bands is less problematic. The dust has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts <b>that</b> <b>create</b> dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, the dust bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri <b>that</b> <b>create</b> deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes <b>that</b> <b>create</b> a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Waves are {{disturbances}} {{that carry}} energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium – air or water, making it oscillate {{as they pass}} by. Wind waves are sea surface waves <b>that</b> <b>create</b> the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models. As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create dunes, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the Taklamakan desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{sometimes}} {{cause problems}} when they raid fruit crops, but their foraging activities are mostly beneficial as they control forest insect pests {{such as the}} woodboring beetles <b>that</b> <b>create</b> galleries behind the bark and can kill trees. They also eat ants, which may be tending sap-sucking pests such as mealybugs, {{as is the case}} with the rufous woodpecker in coffee plantations in India. Woodpeckers can serve as indicator species, demonstrating the quality of the habitat. Their hole-making abilities make their presence in an area an important part of the ecosystem, because these cavities are used for breeding and roosting by many bird species that are unable to excavate their own holes, as well as being used by various mammals and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Mistra {{was ruled}} from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, {{there are several}} {{basilica}} plan churches with domed galleries <b>that</b> <b>create</b> a five-domed cross-in-square over a ground-level basilica plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310–22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica. The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a quincunx pattern. A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section {{similar to those of}} Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services <b>that</b> <b>create</b> good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms <b>that</b> <b>create</b> a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika is a generalist herbivore, mainly {{foraging}} for mosses, trees branches, pine nuts, {{and plant}} stems, which it gathers {{during the summer}} to create haypiles for use in winter. These haypiles were estimated by I.V. Travina in 1984 {{to be as much}} as 30kg per hectare (12kg per acre) when the population density is around 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. This store would sometimes be shared with other species such as reindeer. In 1978, Khlebnikova documented the influence exerted by the alpine pika on plant diversity and composition in the regions they inhabit. These include reduced seed content of the soil, decreased ratio of flowering plants, and slow succession of plants such as the Siberian pine due to the pika's foraging on young trees. The remnants of the haypiles, however, might facilitate plant growth and the accumulation of pellets <b>that</b> <b>create</b> spots of nitrophilic vegetation (vegetation rich in nitrogen).|$|E

5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed <b>that</b> <b>create</b> a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E
5|$|The mantapa is {{the hall}} where {{groups of people}} gather during prayers. The {{entrance}} to the mantapa normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a makaratorana (makara is an imaginary beast and torana is an overhead decoration). The open mantapa which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer mantapa) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed mantapa and the shrine(s). The open mantapas which are often spacious have seating areas (asana) made of stone with the mantapa's parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars <b>that</b> <b>create</b> many bays. The shape of the open mantapa is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open mantapa has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The mantapa ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.|$|E
