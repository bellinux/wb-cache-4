A unique reaction to identify antineutrinos, sometimes referred to as inverse beta decay, as applied by Reines and Cowan (see below), requires a very large detector to detect a significant number of neutrinos. All detection methods require the neutrinos to carry a minimum <b>threshold</b> <b>energy.</b> So far, there is no detection method for low-energy neutrinos, in the sense that potential neutrino interactions (for example by the MSW effect) cannot be uniquely distinguished from other causes. Neutrino detectors are often built underground to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} <b>threshold</b> dissociation <b>energies</b> of {{a series}} of flavonoid/transition metal/auxiliary ligand complexes of the type [MII (flavonoid − H) auxiliary ligand]+ formed by electrospray ionization (ESI) were measured by energy-variable collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) in a quadrupole ion trap (QIT). For each of the isomeric flavonoid diglycoside pairs, the rutinoside (with a 1 – 6 inter-saccharide linkage) requires a greater CAD energy and thus has a higher dissociation threshold than its neohesperidoside (with a 1 – 2 inter-saccharide linkage) isomer. Likewise, the <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> of complexes containing flavones are higher than those containing flavanones. The monoglycoside isomers also have characteristic <b>threshold</b> <b>energies.</b> The flavonoids that are glycosylated at the 3 -O- position tend to have lower <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> than those glycosylated at the 7 -O- or 4 ′-O- position, and those that are C- bonded have lower <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> than the O- bonded isomers. The structural features that substantially influence the <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> include the aglycon type (flavanone versus flavone), the type of disaccharide (rutinose versus neohesperidose), and the linkage type (O- bonded versus C- bonded). Various computational means were applied to probe the structures and conformations of the complexes and to rationalize the differences in <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> of isomeric flavonoids. The most favorable coordination geometry of the complexes has a plane-angle of about 62 °, which means that the deprotonated flavonoid and 2, 2 ′-bipyridine within a complex do not reside on the same plane. Stable conformations of five cobalt complexes and five deprotonated flavonoids were identified. The conformations were combined with the point charges and helium accessible surface areas to explain qualitatively the differences in <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> for isomeric flavonoids...|$|R
