5|$|By {{the end of}} August, news {{had reached}} Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the Cape Fear River.

Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three canoes to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his flagship Henry had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe crews to approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet.

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with <b>the</b> <b>Henry</b> Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by <b>the</b> <b>Henry</b> Moore Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for <b>the</b> <b>Henry</b> Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and <b>the</b> <b>Henry</b> Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, <b>the</b> <b>Henry</b> Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hydrologic Alteration and Sedimentation in <b>the</b> Upper <b>Henry’s</b> Fork Watershed Amelie Jeanne Charnaux <b>The</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Fork of <b>the</b> Snake River is venerated by {{the global}} {{recreational}} community {{as one of the}} finest trout fishing streams on the planet. Furthermore, this remarkable waterway flows within the bounds {{of one of the most}} important ecological corridors in the equally world-renowned Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. While the recreational and biological features of this corner of Idaho may capture the interest of the broader public, the waterway is equally significant to the livelihoods of local interests, such as the ranching and farming communities. With the stakes running high for all interest groups, a case study of <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Fork watershed provides a valuable baseline narrative for understanding decision-making related to water resources not only in Idaho, but also in other Western states. Environmental impacts of <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Lake Dam and management of the stream below the structure were evaluated by literature review and GIS mapping, with research emphasis placed on the ecological integrity and fisheries of <b>the</b> Upper <b>Henry’s</b> Fork Subbasin. <b>The</b> literature review focused on natural processes in stream ecosystems and anthropogenic impacts, with the goal of providing information for the development of management policies that minimize the negative impacts of current flow management and land use. Literature sources overwhelmingly agree that the alteration of natural hydrologic regimes is the most serious and continuing threat to the sustainability of river ecosystems. In recent decades, downstream recreational fishing declined on <b>the</b> upper <b>Henry’s</b> Fork due to increased sedimentation, inciting investigation as to the source. Three major anthropogenic factors targeting one section of <b>the</b> river, <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Lake Outlet, set the stage for excess sedimentation. First, <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Lake Dam was constructed in 1923, impacting the Outlet’s hydrology through changes in the timing, magnitude, and frequency of low and high flows. Second, an artificial stream channel was constructed in the 1920 s to bypass the meandering Outlet in order to increase conveyance capacity of irrigation water from Henry’s Lake to downstream water users. Third, long-term livestock grazing along this section of river dramatically reduced riparian and upland vegetation, triggering the loss of stream-bank stability and increasing erosion and sedimentation. These management practices have resulted in significant loss of biodiversity in the stream ecosystem and an increased rate of erosion in <b>the</b> Outlet. <b>The</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Lake Outlet restoration project, led by <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Fork Foundation, provides the opportunity to predict potential effects of large-scale restoration in <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Fork watershed. <b>The</b> project seeks to reduce sediment delivery downstream from the Outlet by rerouting flow from the straightened channel into the historic channel. The project tests the hypothesis that, by restoring the meandering stream channel, and thereby adding a half-mile to the Outlet, bank erosion and channel instability will decrease, the interaction between stream and riparian habitats will improve, and overall ecosystem health will benefit. In spite of the proactive intentions of the project, it will not change the current management of stream flow. In order to restore <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Lake Outlet to a state of dynamic equilibrium in terms of erosion and sediment load, <b>the</b> flows from <b>Henry’s</b> Lake Dam must more closely reflect the natural hydrologic regime. However, the ability to implement full restoration of the Outlet is complicated by the conflict between the requirements for ecosystem health and economic and socio-political pressures, a story common to many water systems throughout the West. Ultimately, it is hoped that this research may be integrated into policy and conservation strategy to mitigate streambank erosion and sedimentation in <b>the</b> <b>Henry’s</b> Fork Subbasin...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{much smaller}} than either the Island Park Caldera or the Yellowstone Caldera, <b>the</b> <b>Henry's</b> Fork Caldera {{is still one of}} the largest calderas in the world and is the only large caldera in the Yellowstone region that is plainly visible.
