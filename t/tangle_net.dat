50|$|Similar to a gillnet, the <b>tangle</b> <b>net,</b> or tooth net, {{is a type}} of nylon fishing net.

50|$|For {{the last}} two decades <b>tangle</b> <b>nets</b> have been set in deep water near steep {{underwater}} cliffs off many islands in the Philippines by local fishermen in order to supplement their income through catching commercially valuable mollusks.

Through the placement of <b>tangle</b> <b>nets</b> 50 to 100 meters long, at depths from 100 meters to 400 meters, this cryptic marine habitat has been explored and many new and/or rare species of gastropods and crustaceans have been acquired.

40|$|Currently, Maja squinado is fished commercially around Jersey and {{exported}} to southern Europe. Jersey fishermen {{have expressed concern}} that increasing levels of fishing effort are required to maintain gross catches. The present study has examined the patterns of growth, moulting, seasonal cycles (abundance, spawning), {{and the effect of}} fishing method (trap, <b>tangle</b> <b>net)</b> and fishing mortality on M. squinado, to provide management information on which to conserve this fishery. Seasonal variation in catch per unit effort (CPUE) of juvenile Maja squinado was closely correlated with seasonal cycles in seawater temperature. Juveniles were first observed in coastal nursery areas in the autumn at a size-of 20 - 40 mm carapace length (CL). Growth and moulting, which only occurred in juvenile crabs, was restricted to the summer and autumn. Growth was rapid and a terminal moult associated with maturity, occurred after approximately 2 ½ years. Terminally-moulted crabs varied in size from 80 mm- 189 mm CL (males) and 75 mm- 155 mm CL (females). Spawning was seasonal, typically occurring between April and November. Duration of egg development was between 2 - 4 months and evidence from the seasonal occurrence of egg stages suggests females may spawn 2 - 3 times. The composition of the commercial catches of Maja squinado varies throughout the year as a result of seasonal migrations; however, catches from shallow ( 20 m) areas contain high proportions of 'hard' adults (which underwent their terminal moults in previous seasons). Differences in catch composition between these two areas arise because of a two month lag between the seasonal offshore migrations of hard and recently-moulted adults, and the location of spider crab nurseries in shallow, coastal areas. The relatively low abundance in catches of hard-shelled adults larger than the minimum legal size (MLS) (l 20 mm CL), and the disappearance from catches, within twelve months of their terminal moult, of most recently-moulted adults larger than the MLS, suggests that fishing mortality is high around Jersey and fishermen rely on the annual recruitment to support the following years' fishing. <b>Tangle</b> <b>net</b> catches contain higher proportions of large, morphometrically mature males and lower proportions of small, juvenile, and female crabs than trap catches.

40|$|A {{pot fishery}} {{directed}} on spider crab (Maja squinado) {{grew out of}} a mixed <b>tangle</b> <b>net</b> and pot fishery for large crustaceans in the early 1980 s. Approximately twenty half decked vessels of 10 m in length have been involved {{for the duration of the}} fishery but the numbers of pots per vessel has increased; currently 10, 000 pots are set for spider crab in Tralee and Brandon Bays during the summer months. Cpue rose initially during the early years of the fishery, then it stabilised and declined although in the late 1990 s it again recovered somewhat. Sampling in 2000 suggests that the size composition of the catch has altered since the early years of the fishery, its main consequence being the removal of the older age groups so that the landings now consist almost entirely of a single year class. Aspects of the biology of the Maja squinado are compared with what is already known of the species and a number of recommendations are made for the future management of the fishery. These include a further increase in the size limit, a ban on tangle nets and a cap on fishing effort. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|The Cowtail Stingray (Pastinachus ater) occurs across {{northern}} Australia, Papua New Guinea, West Papua, Indonesia, {{and parts}} of the Solomon Islands, where it lives in intertidal lagoons, reef flats and reef faces, sandy habitats and estuaries at depths of up to 60 m, although it prefers shallow water. This species is caught regularly in demersal <b>tangle</b> <b>net,</b> bottom trawl, longline, Danish seine and beach seine fisheries throughout its range. In the Arafura Sea, the Indonesian rhynchobatid fishery is very intensive and the level of exploitation is extremely high. Catches in inshore waters of the Arafura Sea have declined, and as a result these vessels have had to travel farther distances to sustain catches. This declining trend is likely to continue in future in the absence of management and because of continued, if not increasing, fishing effort. However, heavy fishing pressure in the Arafura Sea represents only a portion of this species' total range. It is considered common and the population appears to be healthy in northern Australia where fisheries are well-managed and effective gear modifications exclude large stingrays in prawn trawl fisheries. Furthermore, it occurs in some significant marine protected areas in Australian waters, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. On account of its status in Australian waters, which represents a large portion of its range, it is assessed as Least Concern...|$|E

40|$|This is an amended {{version of}} the 2015 {{assessment}} to accommodate the change in genus from Himantura to Urogymnus. The Mangrove Whipray (Urogymnus granulatus) is a large-bodied (to 141 cm disc width), uncommon stingray, with a widespread distribution in the eastern Indian and western Pacific oceans, from Sri Lanka and eastern India, through to Indonesia. It also occurs along the northern coast of Australia and throughout some of the Pacific Islands. The species appears to prefer shallow inshore waters, including mangroves, estuaries, sand flats and broken rocky-sandy substrate, although adults may move offshore to at least 85 m depth. The species' preference for inshore habitats {{and the fact that}} it is apparently uncommon compared to other Himantura species, makes it particularly vulnerable to widespread and intensive artisanal and industrial fisheries operating throughout large areas of its range, as well as habitat destruction and pollution. Significant destruction and degradation of mangrove areas and targeting of juveniles in shallow waters are thought to have significantly affected this species. It is caught irregularly by <b>tangle</b> <b>net,</b> bottom trawl (including large numbers of trawlers targeting rhynchobatids in the Arafura Sea) and longline fisheries and retained for human consumption. Levels of exploitation are very high throughout its range in Southeast Asia and in many parts of the Indian Ocean, hence it is under a severe level of threat within most of this range. Although no species-specific data are available, overall catches of stingrays are reported to be declining in areas of Southeast Asia for which information is available, with fishermen having to travel further and further to sustain catch levels. Species that inhabit a similar habitat to this species (such as the Sicklefin Lemon Shark (Negaprion acutidens)) are now rarely observed in Indonesia due to high levels of exploitation, and significant declines are also inferred to have occurred in the Mangrove Whipray in Indonesia and other areas. Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range in Southeast Asia where the species is caught in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays, the level of decline (> 30...|$|E
