5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E

40|$|Businesses and organisations are {{undertaking}} innovative {{projects to}} gain competitive {{advantage in the}} market. Research into innovative project management has been biased towards how innovative projects are managed {{to the detriment of}} the formulation of success criteria for innovative projects. There is a need to evaluate how innovative projects are managed. Project managers for innovative projects find it difficult to do so because success criteria for innovative projects have not been formulated. This paper is a theoretical study on managing different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> as different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> are managed in different ways. The paper also explores the characteristics <b>of</b> conventional <b>projects</b> as opposed to inno-vative projects and R&D projects. In addition, it critically analyses the differences between project man-agement in conventional projects and project management in innovative projects. By comparing the char-acteristics <b>of</b> conventional <b>projects</b> to those <b>of</b> innovative <b>projects</b> and R&D projects, and the way these different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> are managed, the paper attempts to formulate success criteria for innovative projects that can be used by project managers to determine the success or failure <b>of</b> innovative <b>projects...</b>|$|R
40|$|While {{it seems}} there are just very few studies on {{branding}} process <b>of</b> mega <b>projects</b> <b>of</b> entertainment, residential, tourism and sport, branding {{is one of the}} most vital factors in these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> In this paper an attempt has been made to devise a branding model for these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> corresponding to Persian characteristics. Researches on this subject mostly focus on place selling, place marketing and tourism destination branding and rarely such projects have been considered. Since in Iran, there is not any special model, the Grounded Theory approach has been used for hypothesizing and discovering the model’s aspects. Deep interviews corresponding to the approach have been conducted. The interviewees consist of scholars, owners and founders, branding and marketing managers, subprojects managers, sales, economic and financial managers, superior consultants, and managers of Tourism Board Organization. Findings imply that the main phenomenon is branding process <b>of</b> mega <b>projects</b> <b>of</b> entertainment, residential, tourism and sport. In addition, causal conditions, context conditions, and intervening conditions are explored, and eventually result of branding for these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> is introduced as an intact model...|$|R
25|$|The {{concept for}} Radiant Historia {{was created by}} Takayashiki, who first pitched his {{proposal}} to Atlus in 2007. His initial concept was for a traditional RPG people would enjoy. Atlus was chosen due to Takayashiki's admiration for their past work. While {{the concept of the}} 3x3 grid-based battle system was conceived by Takayashiki in the initial proposal, many of the additional elements related to skills were contributed by Atlus staff. According to Hirata, Atlus were intrigued at the collaboration as Radiant Historia was the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> that would not have appeared within the company. When designing the gameplay, the Atlus staff kept the basic proposal intact while streamlining through refining the mechanics and simplifying sprite animations to quicken the pace of standard battles. The enemy AI was also adjusted to be less punishing while adding field actions to give players an advantage. The time-travel element caused problems for the team as they worked out how to depict the White Chronicle as a game mechanic, while also putting in frequent text updates so players would not forget the story despite the game's place on the portable Nintendo DS meaning interruptions were likely. Atlus later described Radiant Historia as their most challenging development for the DS platform.|$|E

40|$|As {{open source}} {{software}} (OSS) development is gaining tremendous popularity, effective OSS project management is becoming increasingly crucial to the success <b>of</b> OSS <b>projects.</b> However, {{few studies have examined}} open source from project management perspective. Furthermore, the congruence between project characteristics and project management has not been recognized in the existing OSS literature despite the vast variety <b>of</b> open source <b>projects</b> in existence. In this paper we identify two fundamental <b>types</b> <b>of</b> OSS <b>projects</b> based on the intended audience <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> namely user-targeted projects and developer-targeted projects. Then we try to identify the aspects <b>of</b> <b>project</b> management that have an impact on OSS project performance for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> Our empirical analysis of a large sample <b>of</b> open source <b>projects</b> indicates that human resource staffing and release management are crucial to both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> In addition, compensation management is particularly important to user-targeted projects whereas communication and coordination is particularly essential to developer-targeted projects...|$|R
