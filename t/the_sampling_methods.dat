50|$|A team of individuals: {{academic}} {{researchers and}} activists {{on behalf of}} the Gay community came together in order to obtain more information about the treatment of homosexual military personnel during the Apartheid Era. This was a research project based on qualitative methodology that helped to further examine why homosexuality was considered to be unusual behavior at that time. Various homosexual individuals - who were targets of the conversion therapy - along with the families and friends of these individuals were interviewed in order to obtain in-depth, first hand, experiences of those directly impacted. Prior to following through with the project, the researchers had to be approved by a research committee. However, the research committee had an issue with researchers using the word abuse as a way of describing what happened to homosexual military personnel. The research committee believed that considering the conversion 'therapy' to be abuse was only an assumption, it was not supported by factual evidence. Therefore, the term abuse, when used in the research project, had to be supported with factual evidence. Additionally, the researchers considered the actions of psychologists initiating this conversion shock therapy as a human rights violation. The research ethics committee, on the other hand, did not agree. This raised concerns about the research project because the committee did not want this to be an investigation into the practices of medical officials involved in the military. Furthermore, the committee questioned <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> of the researchers. Because researchers would be accepting volunteers, they found that the sampling method used would not be representative of the experience as a whole.|$|E

40|$|We examine <b>the</b> learning-curve <b>sampling</b> <b>method,</b> an {{approach}} for applying machinelearning algorithms to large data sets.

This paper focuses on <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> used to validate the coarse-resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) product in the Heihe River Basin, where the patterns of spatial variations in and between land cover types vary significantly in the different growth stages of vegetation. A sampling method, called the mean of surface with non-homogeneity (MSN) method, and three other sampling methods are examined with real-world data obtained in 2012. A series of 15 -m-resolution fractional vegetation cover reference maps were generated using the regressions of field-measured and satellite data. <b>The</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> were tested using the 15 -m-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover maps over a complete period of vegetation growth. Two scenes were selected to represent the situations in which sampling locations were sparsely and densely distributed. The {{results show that the}} FVCs estimated using the MSN method have errors of approximately less than 0. 03 in the two selected scenes. The validation accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> varies with variations in the stratified non-homogeneity in the different growing stages of the vegetation. The MSN method, which considers both heterogeneity and autocorrelations between strata, is recommended for use in the determination of samplings prior to the design of an experimental campaign. In addition, the slight scaling bias caused by the non-linear relationship between NDVI and FVC samples is discussed. The positive or negative trend of the biases predicted using a Taylor expansion is found to be consistent with that of the real biases...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to improve the {{prediction}} performance of fault-prone module prediction models (fault-proneness models) by employing over/under sampling methods, which are preprocessing procedures for a fit dataset. <b>The</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> are expected to improve prediction performance when the fit dataset is imbalanced, i. e. there exists a large difference between the number of fault-prone modules and not-fault-prone modules. So far, there has been no research reporting the effects of applying sampling methods to fault-proneness models. In this paper, we experimentally evaluated the effects of four sampling methods (random over sampling, synthetic minority over sampling, random under sampling and one-sided selection) applied to four fault-proneness models (linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression analysis, neural network and classification tree) by using two module sets of industry legacy software. All four sampling methods improved the prediction performance of the linear and logistic models, while neural network and classification tree models did not benefit from <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> The improvements of F 1 -values in linear and logistic models were 0. 078 at minimum, 0. 224 at maximum and 0. 121 at the mean...|$|E
