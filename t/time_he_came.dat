5|$|Bridges {{was named}} in the England C team, who {{represent}} England at non-League level, in January 2006, for a friendly against Italy C, staged at Cambridge's Abbey Stadium, his home ground at the <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>came</b> on as a 73rd-minute substitute as England C won the match 3–1 {{in front of a}} crowd of 2,711.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively {{investigated}} a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, Divine Science, Spiritualism, and Theosophy. He found, however, {{that none of these}} religions held his interest. In <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the realization that he would not adhere to any one denomination, but develop a faith of his own by combining aspects of several different religions.|$|E

5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} lyrics to every song the group {{performed}} until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing {{the lyrics to}} the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to empathize with criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, accordions, and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{had much}} money, so they {{determined}} to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens {{of birds and}} insects. Both made extensive travels — {{in different parts of}} the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections, especially of insects. Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years; on the voyage, his ship caught fire, and his collection was destroyed; undeterred, he set out again, leading eventually (1869) to a comparable book, The Malay Archipelago. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> home in November 1859, Bates had collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to describe what is now called Batesian mimicry, where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species. Bates's account of his stay, including observations of nature and the people around him, occupies his book.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of his school education, Rajinikanth continued to perform various {{jobs in the}} cities of Bangalore and Madras, including that of a coolie and carpenter, and finally ended up being recruited in the Bangalore Transport Service (BTS) as a bus conductor. He began {{to take part in}} stage plays after Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of his mythological plays. During the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> across an advertisement issued by the newly formed Madras Film Institute which offered acting courses. Though his family was not fully supportive of his decision to join the institute, his friend and co-worker Raj Bahadur motivated him to join the institute and financially supported him during this phase. During his stay at the institute, he was performing in a stage play and got noticed by Tamil film director K. Balachander. The director advised him to learn to speak Tamil, a recommendation that Rajinikanth quickly followed.|$|E

25|$|Boyce quickly {{moved to}} abandon the {{conservative}} approaches practiced by most nascent mine unions at the <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>came</b> to believe that class warfare made trade unionism obsolete and came {{out in favor of}} militant industrial unionism.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this same}} <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{in contact with}} the Drawing and Painting Academy (Tegne- og Malerakademiet), {{predecessor}} to the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi). Until then the Academy has had an impoverished existence with weak leadership. Eigtved overtook administrative responsibility for the Academy in 1745 after Hieronimo Miani’s departure as leader from Denmark.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Talamantes {{entered the}} Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy. He {{obtained}} his doctorate of theology from the University of San Marcos. Afterwards {{he served as a}} high official in the Archdiocese of Lima, and for two years as an assistant to Viceroy of Peru, Francisco Gil de Taboada. During this <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to know Hipólito Unanue, a fighter for the independence of America.|$|E

25|$|At this <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{into contact}} with Edward Cronin of Kensington—one {{of the members of}} the first missionary party of the Plymouth Brethren to Baghdad. It is {{believed}} that Taylor learned his faith mission principles from his contact with the Brethren. Taylor was able to borrow a copy of China: Its State and Prospects by Walter Henry Medhurst, which he quickly read. About this time, he began studying the languages of Mandarin, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.|$|E
25|$|In September 2000, {{footage of}} the {{reported}} shooting in the Gaza Strip of a Palestinian boy, Muhammad al-Durrah, was broadcast by France 2. Narrating the footage, Enderlin stated that al-Durrah had been targeted and killed by shots fired from Israeli positions. Over <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> under criticism {{from a number of}} commentators, who asserted first that the bullets that killed the boy were not fired by the Israeli army, and that Enderlin participated to the making of the staged scene.|$|E
25|$|Bujor {{took his}} Baccalaureate at Iași (1880), then {{performed}} his six-months {{service in the}} Romanian Land Forces, at a cavalry regiment, and ultimately enrolled at the Natural Sciences department, University of Bucharest, {{while working as a}} copyist in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. At the <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to be influenced by Grigore Cobălcescu's materialism, which informed his worldview and attracted him to left-wing ideas. Eventually, sponsored by his brother-in-law, he was able to fulfill his dream of studying biology at the University of Paris, under Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers. According to other reports, he also received a Romanian state scholarship.|$|E

25|$|After marrying in 1872 (see notes below on his family), Ross {{became chief}} {{engineer}} of the Wisconsin Central Railway {{and then the}} Lake Ontario Shore Railroad. On Lake Ontario, Ross {{came into contact with}} George Laidlaw and several other well-connected railway promoters who persuaded him to come to Canada. He was appointed chief engineer to Laidlaw's Victoria Railway and in 1879 he built the Credit Valley Railway. He was then appointed acting consulting engineer for the Ontario and Quebec Railway, during which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> into contact with three ambitious young men, namely William Mackenzie, Donald Mann and Herbert S. Holt.|$|E
25|$|The son of {{a member}} of the Royal Air Force, Keenan was brought up in Swatragh, County Londonderry, before his family moved to Belfast. As a teenager, Keenan moved to England to find work, for a time working as a {{television}} repairman in partnership with his brother in Corby, Northamptonshire. During this <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{to the attention of the}} police when he damaged a cigarette machine, which led to police having his fingerprints on file. Keenan returned to Northern Ireland when the Troubles began, and started working at the Grundig factory in the Finaghy area of Belfast where he acquired a reputation as a radical due to his involvement in factory trade union activities. An RTE documentary would later detail that Keenan was the linchpin of the kidnap and murder of his former employer at the same Grundig factory, director Thomas Niedermayer.|$|E
25|$|Outside of his {{overseeing}} of the mihnah, Ibn Abi Du'ad {{spent his}} time at court developing a reputation for moderation and compassion, interceding on several occasions to save individuals who had become subject to al-Mu'tasim's wrath from punishment and securing favors from the caliph for various patrons. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{to play an important}} role in the fiscal affairs of the caliphate, his staff overseeing, for example, the division of spoils during the Amorium campaign in 838; he is also said to have pushed through an irrigation canal project in Khurasan, and following a large fire in Baghdad he was able to convince the caliph to entrust him with distributing five million dirhams for the relief of the citizens there. Ibn Abi Du'ad additionally took part in the move to the new capital of Samarra in 836, where he received a land allotment in the central city, and in 840 he presided over the heresy trial of the disgraced general al-Afshin.|$|E

25|$|Alfred Herbert Richardson (1874–1951) was an English policeman. He {{joined the}} Birmingham City Police in 1890. He {{achieved}} very rapid promotion within this force and in 1901 became Chief Constable of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1903 he successfully {{applied for the}} Chief Constable's office at Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained {{until his retirement in}} 1944. During his time there he achieved many early improvements in policing at Halifax, some of which were later used nationwide. The most notable were the installing of coloured lights as traffic signals at road junctions, the formalisation of procedures for police identity parades, making 'keep left' mandatory for traffic and the installation of police telephones in the town, among others. In later years he was recognized as being a policeman who was ahead of his <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>came</b> from a police family: his father, Frank Richardson (1851–1938), was the Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882 until 1920, and his elder brother, Ernest Frank Richardson (1871–1952), served as Chief Constable of Salisbury between 1903 and 1929. Thus three members of the Richardson family served as chief constables between 1902 and 1920. He also had three other brothers who served in other police forces.|$|E
25|$|Although his {{great-grandfather}} John Carter had freed slaves {{in his will}} (as well as provided homesteads and livestock for them), manumission became illegal in the year Carter's father and grandfather died, and did not again become legal until 1783. King Carter in fact had greatly expanded slavery in Virginia, purchasing many off ships and owning {{more than a thousand}} slaves upon his death. King Carter gave his grandson his first slave (a girl) when he was just three months old. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> of legal age in 1749, Robert Carter III owned 6500 acres of land and 100 slaves. Although Carter sold land and some slaves to pay his debts in 1758, he did not purchase slaves (unlike George Washington and other neighbors), and in fact became known for his humane treatment. Carter's plantations had roughly double the rate of slave population increase as others in the state. Carter was particularly moved by the example of Governor Fauquier, who in his will allowed his slaves to choose their masters. When Carter became a co-administrator of his father-in-law's estate, he (with the support of Daniel Dulany) delayed scheduling a sale of the slaves of Bel-Air plantation, since that would break up families, although his procrastination led to more than 18 years of litigation with his Tasker in-laws. Furthermore, Carter rarely whipped slaves, or allowed them to be whipped, let alone scarred them although he whipped his children, particularly his eldest son Robert Bladen.|$|E
