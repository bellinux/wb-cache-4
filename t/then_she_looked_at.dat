60|$|Mrs. Acton {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him sharply.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him; but {{he would}} neither open his mouth nor look again.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Claire did not speak. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her watch and got up.|$|E
25|$|The King is seen {{asleep on}} a couch. Nisia sits beside a table on which rests his crown. She gazes sadly on this symbol of earthly power, {{conscious}} of the gloomy future that lies before her. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Candaules, the cause of her fall.|$|R
6000|$|... "She never says them, sir. She allus {{pretends to}} be feeling stronger. But I knows what is in her mind when I am leaving {{the house in the}} morning, for <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me from her bed, and I <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her from the door--oh, my God, sir!" ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{face for}} a moment shone. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> down <b>at</b> her gown. He laughed.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pope glanced sharply at her daughter's white face, {{and found}} an enigma. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Magnet.|$|E
60|$|They {{were both}} {{silent for a}} few minutes. A car passed them unnoticed. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him curiously.|$|E
60|$|She unfurled her fan--an ancient but {{wonderful}} {{weapon of}} defence. It {{gave her a}} brief respite. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him calmly.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him, frightened, like a {{thing that}} is afraid of death.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke the}} seal, {{went to the}} table, and read. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him, {{and smiled}} {{in a way}} that told so much to Arabella.|$|R
60|$|Ida {{took the}} letter, {{and her face}} {{hardened}} as she read. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him with a suggestive straightening of her brows.|$|E
60|$|She {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} a wave of the hand. To her it was altogether a minor matter. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} {{she felt like}} laughing. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his kind and simple face and she broke down again and cried.|$|E
5000|$|When he and Jenny get together, [...] "we {{done all}} sorts of things that... I never even dreamt of in my wildest imagination... We rolled all over the livin' room an' into the kitchen... When we is finally finished, Jenny jus lie there a while, an' <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me an' say, 'Goddam Forrest, where have you been all my life?'" ...|$|R
60|$|Hetty turned very white. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> Harry, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> {{did not say}} {{a single}} word.|$|R
60|$|She settled {{herself a}} little more comfortably, and {{smoothed}} out her skirts. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him with faintly parted lips.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the Shaman, the {{man turned}} to stone who all this while had stood there as a statue stands, and cried--"Awake!" ...|$|E
60|$|The exclamation awoke Cora, who {{sat up and}} yawned. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her sister, {{and being}} only half-awake, smiled in an {{imbecile}} manner.|$|E
60|$|Benita {{could find}} no words, her heart was too full of thankfulness. Only she seized Robert's hand and kissed it. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Jacob.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him, {{her dark}} eyes glowing and brilliant, her face shining with {{the light of a}} great tenderness.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> shyly <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Shefford. <b>She</b> {{was like}} the fresh dawn, and the gold of the sun shone on her head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Eaten {{out with}} listlessness. She's neither sick nor sorry, but how dull and dreary she is, only herself can tell. When I {{get there in}} the morning, there she is sitting up in bed, for my lady don't care to get up; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> makes me bring this book and that book, till the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her, making her <b>look,</b> as <b>she</b> leans upon her elbow, like the stoning of Stephen. <b>She</b> yawns; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> towards the tall glass; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> out <b>at</b> the weather, mooning her great black eyes, and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my tongue goes flick-flack along, {{a hundred and fifty}} words a minute; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the clock; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> asks me what I've been reading.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Finch {{said that}} anybody with arf an {{eye could see}} that, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> a kettle that was singing on the 'ob.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him steadily. [...] "It is {{the first}} time you have been here. Something unusual must have brought you. Jimmy, is it war?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Castro did {{not speak}} for a few moments, but Dane felt that she {{understood}} {{more than he had}} said. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him steadily.|$|E
60|$|She {{recognised}} {{the note}} {{of authority in}} his tone, and she bowed her head. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him; <b>she</b> was a changed woman.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle's eyes {{took the}} same direction; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> serenely <b>at</b> her neighbour. [...] "You know I never {{understand}} you very well," [...] she smiled.|$|R
60|$|She untied {{the string}} with {{trembling}} fingers. Wrayson {{handed her a}} paper-knife and she cut open {{the top of the}} envelope. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him appealingly.|$|R
60|$|Again she {{was silent}} for some moments, as if {{struggling}} with herself. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him--a long, strange, dark look, incomprehensible, and {{which he did not}} like.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Jock, and {{wondered}} {{whether he would}} harbour any such resentment against her {{when he came to}} perceive what she had seen beginning at Fordham.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and found}} herself puzzled by the perfect impassivity of his features. Surely he would drop the mask now. He had insisted upon her coming! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} she's been {{transformed}} into Button-Bright?" [...] said Dorothy nervously. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> steadily <b>at</b> the boy and asked, [...] "Are you Ozma? Tell me truly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{directly}} <b>at</b> him {{and tried}} to speak. Her first attempt was inarticulate, her second was a whisper, [...] "Didn't you ever--think I--I might care for you?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{read the}} few lines instructing the English Bank {{to hand over}} Sir Henry Hunterleys' letters to the bearer. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> him with a puzzled frown.|$|R
