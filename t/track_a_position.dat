40|$|Long-latency (40 - 80 ms) electromyographic (e. m. g.) {{responses}} of the contracting flexor pollicis longus to stretches applied at the thumb-tip, were studied in normal human subjects. Stretches were applied during four classes of contraction: (i) isometric 'hold', in which the subject held a steady isometric contraction; (ii) isometric tracking, in which the subject tracked a steadily rising force target; (iii) isotonic tracking, in which the subject flexed against a constant torque to <b>track</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> target; (iv) weight-lifting, in which the subject lifted a weight hung {{at one end of}} a lever by pressing the thumb-tip {{on the other end of}} the lever. The effects on the {{responses of}} prior instructions to 'resist' or to 'let go', and of local anaesthesia of the thumb, were studied. The ability to modify the size of the long-latency e. m. g. response in accordance with prior instruction was variable. All subjects tested could do so during isometric holding contractions, but many could not do so during the other forms of contraction. Local anaesthesia of the thumb significantly reduced the long-latency e. m. g. response in only some subjects, and abolished it in none. The reduction was most reliably seen for isometric force tracking contractions. During thumb anaesthesia in different subjects, there was a significant correlation between the proportional increase in apparent heaviness of an object lifted by thumb flexion and the proportional reduction in the size of the long-latency e. m. g. response to muscle stretch...|$|E
40|$|Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have been}} an area of great {{interest}} for academic research at several universities around the world. They provide an interesting platform for research into various control related areas such as modelling, testing dierent control strategies or cooperative behaviour and possible real-world applications within search-and-rescue, trac surveillance and many other areas {{with the potential to}} improve everyday life. In this thesis, the process of designing and implementing a testbed that allows for practical multi-agent control related experiments with Quadrotor UAVs is described. The testbed consists of a centralized controller PC, a positioning system for determining the quadrotors position in space and a bi-directional wireless link for communicating with the quadrotors. The controller PC software in LabVIEW and the various interfaces to the subsystems in C, C # and under TinyOS are implemented considering the main goal to have a robust platform that allows for quick testing and debugging of dierent control algorithms. To be able to perform simulation and understand the dynamic behaviour of the quadrotors, a mathematical model is derived. The model is then used to design PID and LQR controllers that allow the quadrotors to <b>track</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> in space. The functionality of the testbed, the performance of the controllers and the validity of the model is successfully evaluated by ight-testing the quadrotors using the testbed and verifying that simulation results are in accordance with the real-world results that are obtained...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Mobility of a hexarotor UAV in its {{standard}} configuration is limited, {{since all the}} propeller force vectors are parallel and they achieve only 4 –DoF actuation, similar, e. g., to quadrotors. As a consequence, the hexarotor pose cannot <b>track</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary trajectory while the center of mass is <b>tracking</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> trajectory. In this paper, we consider a different hexarotor architecture where propellers are tilted, without the need of any additional hardware. In this way, the hexarotor gains a 6 –DoF actuation which allows to independently reach positions and orientations in free space {{and to be able}} to exert forces on the environment to resist any wrench for aerial manipulation tasks. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed hexarotor, we discuss the controllability and the tilt angle optimization to reduce the control effort for the specific task. An exact feedback linearization and decoupling control law is proposed based on the input-output mapping, considering the Jacobian and task acceleration, for non-linear trajectory tracking. The capabilities of our approach are shown by simulation results. I...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to combine the theory on synchronization of robot manipulators {{with the concept of}} hybrid force/motion control; resulting in a controller capable of following both the trajectory of another robot and a desired force trajectory at the same time. 	 This report includes a short introduction to synchronization theory for robot manipulators, and a more thorough summary of existing hybrid control schemes. 	 An intuitive method for describing constraints caused by the environment is presented, and this leads to a straightforward way to separate the interaction control problem into two subproblems. When the manipulator end-effector is in contact with a surface, the hybrid controller <b>tracks</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> reference along the surface and a force reference normal to the surface. 	 The contribution of this thesis is a proposed hybrid controller, incorporating ideas from previous hybrid schemes. The closed loop system is shown to be globally asymptotically stable in the position controlled degrees of freedom, and bounded in the force controlled degrees of freedom. The performance of the proposed hybrid control concept is demonstrated by simulations. 	 The proposed hybrid controller easily reduces to <b>a</b> pure <b>position</b> controller when desired. </p...|$|R

40|$|Visual <b>tracking</b> is <b>a</b> {{critical}} task in many computer vision {{applications such as}} surveillance, vehicle tracking, and motion analysis. The challenges in designing <b>a</b> robust visual <b>tracking</b> algorithm are caused {{by the presence of}} background clutter, occlusion, and illumination changes. In this paper, we propose <b>a</b> visual <b>tracking</b> algorithm in <b>a</b> particle filter framework to overcome these three challenging issues. Particle filter is an inference technique for estimating the unknown motion state from a noisy collection of observations, so we employ particle filter to learn the trajectory of a target. The proposed algorithm depends on the learned trajectory to predict the <b>position</b> of <b>a</b> target at a new frame, and corrects the predication by a process that can be entitled field transition. At the beginning of the <b>tracking</b> stage, <b>a</b> set of disturbance templates around the target template are accurately selected and defined as particles. During <b>tracking,</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of the <b>tracked</b> target is firstly predicted based on the learned motion state, and then we take the normalized cross-correlation coefficient as a level to select the most suitable field transition parameters of the predicted position from the corresponding parameters of the particles. After judging the target is not occluded, we apply the named field transition with the selected parameters to compensate the predicted position to the accurate location of the target, meanwhile, we make use of the calculated cross-correlation coefficient as a posterior knowledge to update the weights of all the particles for the next prediction. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed tracking algorithm, we test the approach on challenging sequences involving heavy background clutter, severe occlusions, and drastic illumination changes. Comparative experiments have demonstrated that this method makes a more significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy than two previously proposed algorithms: the mean shift tracking algorithm (MS) and the covariance tracking algorithm (CT) ...|$|R
