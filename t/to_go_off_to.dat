5|$|Eight months later, as {{the city}} is besieged by the Union Army in the Atlanta Campaign, Scarlett and her young house servant Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical {{assistance}} after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett {{to take her home}} to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig and the Princess {{are about}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> yet another wedding party, when Ernest, Rudolph and Dr Tannh√§user burst in. The Notary {{reveals that the}} Act {{regulating}} statutory duels specifically states that the ace shall count as lowest, so Ludwig did not win, was never Grand Duke, and cannot have revived the act. Within seconds, the Act expires, returning Ludwig and Ernest to the living. Three couples marry: Rudolph and the Princess; Ernest and Julia; and Ludwig and Lisa.|$|E

25|$|Prior to World War II, the U.S. Army {{constructed}} a new fort in Richmond County, Camp Gordon, which was finished {{a few days}} after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Many new soldiers were brought to this camp to train <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war. Within the few months after WWII, many of the GIs at Camp Gordon had been sent back home, and the importance of the army in the community seemed to almost come to an end. Music legend James Brown, then a teenager, often performed for the soldiers. Brown grew up in Augusta during the 1930s and 1940s (he lived with his aunt, who was the madam of a house of prostitution).|$|E
25|$|On December 25, 1991, Ang Totoong Buhay ni Pacita M. {{was part}} of the 1991 Metro Manila Film Festival. The film tells the story of Pacita M., a singer-entertainer in a seedy Quezon City nightclub whose {{daughter}} Grace {{was shot in the head}} by a stray bullet just as she was preparing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> college. Although initially Pacita held out for a miracle to save her daughter form her vegetative state, eventually she relents and seeks to allow Grace a dignified death by turning off her respirator. The emotional battle becomes a personal epiphany for Pacita. This highly acclaimed movie directed by Elwood Perez bravely tackles the sensitive issue of euthanasia. Aunor won numerous awards for her performance, including the Metro Manila Film Festival Best Actress, her fourth Gawad Urian, and her third consecutive Best Actress trophy from the Film Academy of the Philippines. She won from Star Awards and from the Young Critics Circle.|$|E
25|$|The {{powerful}} Duke of Westmorland {{learns that}} the gallant young soldier Edward {{is in love}} with his daughter, Albina, who is a young widow to Count Raimond. Despite her love for Edward, Albina's virtue impedes her from agreeing to marry him. Westmorland and Edward persuade her to remarry because Edward is soon destined <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war; she agrees. Editha, who is jealous of Albina, seeks help from Lord Gondibert, Raimond's brother, who secretly loves Albina. On the eve of the wedding, Gondibert tells Edward that Albina has been unfaithful, and to prove it he disguises himself and allows Edward to spy on him sneaking into Albina's chamber at night. Edward then calls off the wedding, and the furious Westmorland challenges him to a duel to protect Albina's honour. Before the duel begins, Gondibert's elderly servant, Egbert, exposes his master's lie, and the king banishes Gondibert. Before he leaves, Gondibert vows to kill Albina and then commit suicide. He sneaks into Albina's chamber and stabs a woman he thinks is Albina, and then he stabs himself. But the woman {{turns out to be a}} disguised Editha, who had also stolen into the room. Edward is relieved when the real Albina rushes into the room, and the dying Gondibert asks for and receives her pardon.|$|E

500|$|Shero {{was the son}} of Russian {{immigrants}} who moved to Winnipeg to avoid religious persecution. He was often bullied for being the son of an immigrant and {{went out of his way}} to avoid some of other children in his neighborhood. Shero credited his childhood experiences as a reason why he tended to be a loner. As a child Shero took up boxing and at age 13 he became a Canadian Bantamweight champion. His success gave him a chance to become a professional boxer, but he decided to play hockey instead. When he signed his first professional contract with the Rangers, his father cautioned him that [...] "hockey players are looking for work when they are 30." [...] When he left Winnipeg's Isaac Newton High School <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> New York to play for the Rovers, he continued his education in his new surroundings.|$|E
500|$|Orci and Kurtzman wrote a {{scene for}} Shatner, in which old Spock gives his younger self a {{recorded}} message by Kirk {{from the previous}} timeline. [...] "It was basically a Happy Birthday wish knowing that Spock was going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Romulus, and Kirk would probably be dead by the time," [...] {{and it would have}} shifted into Shatner reciting [...] "Where no man has gone before". However, Shatner wanted to share Nimoy's major role, and did not want a cameo, despite his character's death in Star Trek Generations. He suggested the film canonize his novels where Kirk is resurrected, but Abrams decided if his character was accompanying Nimoy's, it would have become a film about the resurrection of Kirk, and not about introducing the new versions of the characters. Nimoy disliked the character's death in Generations, but also felt resurrecting Kirk would be detrimental to this film, and his friendship with Shatner caused them to avoid discussing the film.|$|E
2500|$|Lutheran {{minister}} Reverend Abraham Essick {{writes in}} his diary that he bumped into Gotwald on May 8, 1861 at the train depot in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (right after the April 13, 1861 fall of Fort Sumter), who was taking his family to Springfield, Ohio to leave them there (without doubt at the King Homestead, with his mother in law, Almena Caldwell King), while he joined the Union Army {{to serve as a}} chaplain or even a private. [...] Gotwald did not so serve. While apparently not formally enlisted in the Union Army, he did serve as the chaplain for a group of Shippensburg soldiers who were getting ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war. This ended in March 1863, when he assumed a parish in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. There were many Confederate sympathizers in Lebanon, so Gotwald's support of the Union cause was not popular with all his parishioners. When the Confederate Army invaded the North in June 1863, he moved his family to safety with his mother, who lived in Aaronsburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E
