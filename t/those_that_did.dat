5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position is not certain. Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E

Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans {{had great}} {{diplomatic}} skill {{and ability to}} raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines, {{they were able to}} exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon mastered the art of siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Plain English Campaign {{was set up}} in 1979 {{when the}} founder, Chrissie Maher, {{shredded}} hundreds of jargon-filled forms and documents in Parliament Square, London.

5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 1990s, after the {{completion}} of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> being critically unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did.</b> Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did,</b> such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E

5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack.

5|$|Macaroni {{penguins}} moult once a year, {{a process}} in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> return did not breed the following year.|$|E
5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E

The Jews of Gibraltar were, like those {{elsewhere}} in the kingdom, expelled from Spain by order of the monarchs in March that year. Gibraltar was used by Medina Sidonia as a base for the Spanish capture of Melilla in North Africa in 1497.

5|$|On October29, in {{the wake}} of Omar, President George W. Bush signed a major {{disaster}} declaration for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works.

5|$|The 1907 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was at one}} point the only Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that did not feature a hurricane.

The first storm of the season formed on June24, while the final dissipated on November12. Damage from the storms were minimal, and no deaths were reported. Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and four additional systems could have formed during the season. A documentation for four possible storms during the season exists, although it has not been proven that these systems were fully tropical.|$|E
