5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theater</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} its primary benefactors, Joan and Irving Harris, who gave a gift of $15million gift ($million in current dollars) and a $24million ($million) {{construction}} loan to the Music and Dance Theater Chicago; this {{was believed to be}} largest single monetary commitment ever to a performing arts organization in Chicago.

5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations.

25|$|Butler {{argues that}} the {{performance}} of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender {{to the performance of}} the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> <b>is</b> much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter {{because of the fact that}} there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the best}} known closed {{captioning}} option for film theaters is the Rear Window Captioning System from the National Center for Accessible Media. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat translucent glass or plastic on a gooseneck stalk, which can be mounted {{in front of the}} viewer's seat. In the back of <b>the</b> <b>theater</b> <b>is</b> an LED display that shows the captions in mirror image. The panel reflects captions for the viewer but is nearly invisible to surrounding patrons. The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.|$|E
