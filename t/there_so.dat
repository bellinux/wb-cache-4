5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge <b>there</b> <b>so</b> they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E

However, it was Orlando who suggested that Hugo should enroll at the University of Alabama School of Law. After graduating in June 1906, he moved back to Ashland and established a legal practice. His practice was not successful <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> Black moved to Birmingham in 1907 where he specialized in labor law and personal injury cases.|$|E

A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down <b>there</b> <b>so</b> the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E

5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat <b>there</b> <b>so</b> as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower portion}} of the river, from the sea to Ford, was navigable in the {{eleventh}} century {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest. In the sixteenth century, Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford, and improved the river channel below <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> that the town became a port. Over the 30 years from 1544, he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay. Although the work involved a number of flash locks, which were not very successful, no tolls were charged for its use, and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber. Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early sixteenth century were not successful.|$|E
5|$|Treasure Trap, {{formed in}} 1982 at Peckforton Castle, {{was the first}} {{recorded}} LARP game in the UK and influenced the fantasy LARPs that followed there.

In 1993, White Wolf Publishing released Mind's Eye Theatre, which is still played internationally and {{is probably the most}} commercially successful published LARP. The first German events were in about 1994 (other sources claim 1992 or 1991), with fantasy LARP in particular growing quickly <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> that since 2001, two major German events have been run annually that have between 3000 and 7000 players each and attract players from around Europe.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating <b>there.</b> <b>So</b> Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E
5|$|Detachments from 5ACS formed part of Australia's {{contribution}} to the Vietnam War. Following the deployment of No.79 Squadron to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand in June 1962, a party of 5ACS personnel was also sent to Ubon to plan and oversee the construction of facilities for the squadron. Work on these facilities was undertaken by 100 Thai civilians who had built over 50 huts and other support infrastructure for No.79 Squadron {{by the time the}} project concluded at the end of 1962. RAAF units began to be deployed to South Vietnam in 1964, and in May 1966 DetachmentA of 5ACS was formed at Vũng Tàu to improve the airfield <b>there</b> <b>so</b> it could support the UH-1 Iroquois-equipped No. 9 Squadron. The 19 members of this detachment returned to Australia on 8October 1966. DetachmentB of 5ACS was subsequently deployed to South Vietnam in January 1967 to build facilities for eight No.2 Squadron Canberra bombers at Phan Rang Air Base. This task was completed in April, and in June DetachmentB moved to Vũng Tàu to complete the construction of facilities there. Work on Vũng Tàu Airport was finished on 20January 1968 and the detachment was disbanded on 17February 1968.|$|E
5|$|Riley made {{occasional}} reading tours around Indiana, and in August 1880 {{was invited}} to perform at Asbury University. His performance <b>there</b> <b>so</b> impressed the local Phi Kappa Psi chapter, he {{was invited to}} join as an honorary member. Through the fraternity he met Robert Jones Burdette, a writer and minister in the Indianapolis area. Burdette {{was a member of the}} Redpath Lyceum Bureau of Boston, a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included Ralph Waldo Emerson. Burdette encouraged Riley to join the circuit through its Chicago branch. Riley's accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881, and he decided rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds. His agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season, beginning in April 1881. He succeeded, drawing the largest crowds in Chicago and Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne could soon be surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. He was supposed to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night <b>there</b> <b>so</b> that he could brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division's acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, but so did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne all during the night and into the following day.|$|E
