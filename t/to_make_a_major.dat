Philip persuaded Parliament to repeal Henry's religious laws, thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and Pope Julius III had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> concession: the monastery lands confiscated under Henry were not returned to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners. By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942, Bladin's {{strength}} in NWA consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly Bristol Beaufighter and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, Lockheed Hudson light bombers, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies B-25 Mitchell medium bombers and USAAF B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. As Japanese air raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland, and his fighters {{close to the}} coast where they could intercept the raiders. Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1January 1943, he stepped up offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the Timor and Arafura Seas as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese. He often employed his own judgement {{in the selection of}} targets, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming. On 27February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield, near Koepang on Timor, that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> raid on Darwin.|$|E

The executionist movement (an attempt to prevent domination by the magnate families of Poland and Lithuania) peaked at the Sejm in Piotrków in 1562–63. On the religious front, the Polish Brethren split from the Calvinists, and the Protestant Brest Bible was published in 1563.

25|$|Written by two Americans with {{a strong}} country-western lyrical theme, the song was first {{released}} in Europe, where it {{has become much more}} popular than in the composers' native country, with a big-band/orchestral pop arrangement sung by Tony Christie. Christie's version was a major hit in Europe and a modest success in his native United Kingdom upon its release, then became even more popular in the mid-2000s when the song was reissued. As Christie's version failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact in the U.S., Sedaka released his own recording of the song in 1977, which narrowly missed the top 40 but was an easy listening hit in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E

25|$|Mismanagement and {{corruption}} resulted in major economic problems. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and a decision <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jesús María de Galíndez, a Basque exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In August 1960, the Organization of American States (OAS) imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President Rómulo Betancourt of Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating {{that they were looking}} for a system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate a modem into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already moved away from the older serial interface with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a serial interface which included GeoPort – a serial data technology that allowed software to emulate a modem. Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E

25|$|Agrippa's {{friendship}} with Augustus {{seems to have}} been clouded by the jealousy of Augustus' nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus, which was probably instigated by the intrigues of Livia, the third wife of Augustus, who feared his influence over her husband. Traditionally it is said the result of such jealousy was that Agrippa left Rome, ostensibly to take over the governorship of eastern provinces – a sort of honourable exile, but he only sent his legate to Syria, while he himself remained at Lesbos and governed by proxy, though he may have been on a secret mission to negotiate with the Parthians about the return of the Roman legions standards which they held. On the death of Marcellus, which took place within a year of his exile, he was recalled to Rome by Augustus, who found he could not dispense with his services. However, if one places the events {{in the context of the}} crisis in 23 BC it seems unlikely that, when facing significant opposition and about <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> political climb down, the emperor Augustus would place a man in exile in charge of the largest body of Roman troops. What is far more likely is that Agrippa's 'exile' was actually the careful political positioning of a loyal lieutenant in command of a significant army as a backup plan in case the settlement plans of 23 BC failed and Augustus needed military support. Moreover, after 23 BC as part of what became known as Augustus' Second Constitutional Settlement, Agrippa's constitutional powers were greatly increased to provide the Principate of Augustus with greater constitutional stability by providing for a political heir or replacement for Augustus if he were to succumb to his habitual ill health or was assassinated. In the course of the year proconsular imperium, similar to Augustus' power, was conferred upon Agrippa for five years. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That was to come later, as was the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas, or powers of a tribune of the plebeians. These great powers of state are not usually heaped upon a former exile.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{felt that}} comedy {{was more of}} her repertoire, and {{proceeded}} to sign a comedy film titled Slammer, written by Andrew Smith and Ken Finkleman. She wanted to play {{the part of a}} street smart girl called Nikki Finn, who was jailed for a crime she did not commit. However, in light of the bad publicity surrounding her and Penn, and also of the very public failure of Shanghai Surprise, Madonna had to persuade producers Rosilyn Heller and Bernard Williams, as well as Warner Brothers, that she was up for the part. In addition, she wanted an old friend, James Foley to direct the film. Foley had previously been Penn's best man at his marriage to Madonna, and had also directed the music videos of Madonna's singles [...] "Live to Tell" [...] (1986) and [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986). He was ecstatic at having the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> feature film, as previously he had only directed the small-budgeted film At Close Range, starring Penn.

500|$|By December 1942, NWA's flying units {{included}} six RAAF squadrons operating mainly Kittyhawks, Beaufighters, Hudsons, and Vultee Vengeance dive bombers, {{as well as}} No.1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which flew a mix of Wirraways, Brewster Buffalos, P-38 Lightnings and P-43 Lancers {{and continued}} to operate out of the Darwin area (as No.87 Squadron from September 1944) {{for the duration of}} the war. These units were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies B-25 Mitchell medium bombers and USAAF B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, with which NWA was able to conduct heavier strikes against Japanese forces north of Australia. [...] Also in December, No.34 (Transport) Squadron, which had been formed under NWA's control in Darwin four days after the first air raid, divested its aircraft to the newly formed No.6 Communications Unit, which remained in the Northern Territory until disbanding shortly after the end of hostilities. No.44 RDF Wing was formed under NWA at Adelaide River on 14December. It was responsible for the radar stations that acted as an early warning system for Japanese attacks. [...] The wing coordinated air defence in the region with No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters. As the raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland and his fighters close to the coast, where they could intercept the attackers. No. 61 (Works) Wing was responsible for airfield construction squadrons and their associated support units. According to historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, NWA was [...] "one of the few areas where the RAAF was free to run its own show" [...] in World WarII. Bladin often employed his own judgement in selecting targets for offensive strikes, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming.

On 28 February, she took part in an attempt to suppress the Ottoman defences in the Dardanelles led by Admiral John de Robeck; the battleships Albion and [...] led the operation, and were tasked with neutralizing the repaired fortress at Dardanus, while Ocean and [...] supported them by engaging batteries of mobile field guns that had proved to be troublesome in previous attempts to neutralise the Ottoman defences. Ocean initially attempted to locate guns that had been active in the vicinity of Sedd el Bahr, before moving on with Majestic and coming under fire from a number of Ottoman batteries, including howitzers around Erenköy. The British battleships eventually silenced the guns, but only temporarily; as soon as the ships moved on to other targets, the guns opened fire again. In the meantime, Albion and Triumph had approached Dardanus but they came under heavy fire from Ottoman guns on the European side of the straits, including the fortress at Erenköy, and were forced to circle to avoid taking hits. Unable to engage Dardanus under these conditions, the ships instead opened fire on the guns at Erenköy, which initially seemed to be effective, as the Ottoman fire slackened. Ocean and Majestic approached in an attempt to attack Dardanus, but they too came under renewed, furious fire from Erenköy, and de Robeck again ordered a withdrawal. The only success came after the four battleships withdrew from the straits and a landing party from Triumph went ashore and disabled a number of light guns. The inability of the British and French fleets to neutralize the mobile field guns convinced the Allied command that the only way forward would be <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> amphibious assault to clear the guns by land.|$|E
