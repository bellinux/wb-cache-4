5|$|It is {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> damage occurred in Escambia and Monroe counties. In the Escambia County city of Atmore, 100 {{percent of the}} city's residents lost electric power for some {{a period of time}} during the hurricane. The strongest winds occurred in Escambia County, where gusts surpassed , leaving numerous structures damaged or destroyed as Dennis tracked through the western half of the county. One man in the county was injured by a fallen tree branch. Also, an unconfirmed tornado tore the roof off a home, forcing emergency workers to evacuate a man inside.|$|E
5|$|Then, on October 14, the National Weather Bureau {{issued a}} warning for the Carolinas, with the caveat <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the {{hurricane}} was expected to stay offshore. Instead, the storm took a sharp northwest turn and headed toward land. By evening of the same day, the storm was forecast to make landfall near the Carolinas border. Further forecasts expected Hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the Allegheny Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E

25|$|A {{consensus}} view is {{that taking}} rigorous high school courses is a plus. Guidance counselors report that admissions personnel take a student's course of study into serious consideration when evaluating applications. Admissions officers construct a high school profile and take into account such data as curriculum offerings, demographics, and grade distributions at the high school. One adviser suggested taking the hardest courses that there were, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing, in terms of evaluations, was to drop a hard course.|$|E
25|$|Ed Harris did not {{actually}} breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) {{below the surface of}} the large tank. He recalled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.|$|E

The suit alleged the children were trafficked to Ivory Coast, forced into slavery, and experienced frequent beatings on a cocoa plantation. In September 2010, the US District Court for the Central District of California determined corporations cannot {{be held liable for}} violations of international law and dismissed the suit. The case was appealed to the US Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Nestle's appeal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.|$|E

25|$|The city's {{authorities}} believed {{until the}} last minute <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> could be avoided, and as such urged the populace to stay home with buckets of water, so as to be prepared to extinguish any fire and prevent its spread. So feeble a means of stopping the fire quickly proved useless, and the panicked residents tried to save their most precious belongings and fled to the heights of the city, east of the Senne valley. A helpless crowd watched the fire from the park at the ducal palace. By the middle of the night, the entire heart of the city was aflame, including the stone buildings of the Grand Place and its surroundings, the Town Hall, abandoned by the authorities and whose spire was being used as a target by the French artillery, the Breadhouse, the Récollet convent and the Church of Saint Nicholas, whose bell fell on and crushed the neighbouring houses. Max Emmanuel, who had hastily returned from Namur with several troops, tried in vain to organize an effective resistance against the inferno and to maintain order.|$|E
500|$|In the end, many {{commentators}} {{find that}} the Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent [...] "a victory over anxiety."

500|$|Hammerstein was embittered by {{audience}} and critical {{reaction to his}} book, and felt they misunderstood it. [...] Public perception was that Hammerstein had implied that small-town folk were good while their big-city cousins were neurotic and venal. [...] The lyricist objected, pointing out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> character in the musical was a small-town girl, but according to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] "he knew it was his fault that the message was not clear."

Stanton found the company (one of the two-man party who had left a month earlier to seek assistance in California), and he brought mules, food, and two Miwok Native Americans named Luis and Salvador. He also brought news that Reed and Herron, although haggard and starving, had succeeded in reaching Sutter's Fort in California. By this point, according to Rarick, [...] "To the bedraggled, half-starved members of the Donner Party, it must have seemed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of their problems had passed.

500|$|Morgan, Stillman, Baker and {{the other}} city bankers were unable to pool money indefinitely. Even the U.S. Treasury was low on funds. Public {{confidence}} needed to be restored, and on Friday evening the bankers formed two committees—one to persuade the clergy to calm their congregations on Sunday, and second {{to explain to the}} press the various aspects of the financial rescue package. Europe's most famous banker, Lord Rothschild, sent word of his [...] "admiration and respect" [...] for Morgan.

500|$|Stating {{that his}} team needed to add {{character}} and leadership, Cliff Fletcher finally completed a trade for McDonald seven years after his first attempt. McDonald was acquired by the Calgary Flames, along with a draft pick, in exchange for Bob MacMillan and Don Lever on November 25, 1981. [...] The deal occurred {{one day after the}} last place Rockies lost to the Flames by a 9–2 score. Once the team's plane landed in Winnipeg, McDonald was informed of the trade and told to return to Calgary. [...] Angered at first, he viewed the deal as an insult, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> team in the NHL had rejected him.|$|E

Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald called the song [...] "irritating" [...] and noted it as [...] "blatant copycat stuff". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner felt that [...] "Bassline" [...] was [...] "a lazy attempt" [...] from Brown. Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> part of the song is the hook. Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review magazine was critical of the production and lyrics, labeling it as [...] "bad" [...] and [...] "dodgy".

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} song {{a list of}} celeb perks: trainer, butler, assistant, three nannies, a {{bodyguard}} or five. It seems, at first, not like the clever self-twitting she clearly intended, but rather a facile confirmation of her haters' conviction: that the middle-aged Madonna {{does not have a}} worldview beyond her next Pilates appointment. In 2004, Blender magazine listed the song at number nine on the list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever, stating that Madonna [...] "updates the 'Material Girl'-era satire of commercialism and spiritual emptiness... with what is hands-down the most embarrassing rap ever recorded. Nervous and choppy, she makes Debbie Harry sound as smooth as Jay-Z." [...] The magazine also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> moment of the song is when after rapping, Madonna sings 'Nothing is what it seems' with no profundity. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song to be [...] "jittery, tuneless, and shallow to the point of self-parody".|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{emergency plan}} for an eruption therefore assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{case will be}} an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 VEI 4 one.
