50|$|Rotala indica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the loosestrife family known by the common name Indian <b>toothcup.</b> It is native to Southeast Asia. This aquatic plant {{is best known as}} a popular aquarium plant and as a weed of rice fields. It is known as an introduced species and a weed in rice-growing regions in Congo, Italy, and Portugal, and California and Louisiana in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Ammannia coccinea is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the loosestrife family known by several common names, including valley redstem, scarlet <b>toothcup,</b> and purple ammannia. It is native {{to most of the}} contiguous United States, {{with the exception of the}} Pacific Northwest and New England. It is generally found in moist areas, such as riverbanks and pond margins. It is weedy in some areas. This is an annual herb growing erect to heights approaching one meter or lying along the ground. Leaves are linear in shape, up to 8 centimeters long, and green to shades of deep red in color. The inflorescence is a cluster of 3 to 5 flowers growing in the leaf axils along the upper part of the stem. The rounded flower has small rose to lavender petals each a few millimeters long and protruding stamens with yellow anthers. The fruit is a rounded capsule up to half a centimeter wide containing many tiny seeds.|$|E
40|$|Roundleaf <b>toothcup</b> is {{native to}} south and {{southeast}} Asia from India to Japan. In its native range, this Rotala species is reported to occur primarily in mountainous areas, including altitudes of more than 2600 m (8500 ft). However, roundleaf <b>toothcup</b> has been recorded in canals in southern Florida and a single pond on the University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa. Roundleaf <b>toothcup</b> is planted in Florida water gardens as a transition plant because it grows well from shorelines out to open water. This flexibility gives roundleaf <b>toothcup</b> a similar advantage to alligatorweed in fluctuating wetland margin habitats. Roundleaf <b>toothcup</b> was first observed in Florida in 1996, and by 2002 it was known to occur in three south Florida counties, {{in addition to the}} one Tuscaloosa, AL, population...|$|E
40|$|Lithoxus jantjae, new species, is {{described}} from above Tencua Falls in {{headwaters of the}} Ventuari River, a white- to clearwater river flowing west from the Maigualida and Parima mountains in the Guayana Highlands of southern Venezuela. Lithoxus jantjae represents a nearly 600 km westward range expansion for a genus historically known only from Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil. Lithoxus jantjae shares with other species of Lithoxus a dorsoventrally depressed body and a large, papilose oral disk with small <b>toothcups</b> and few teeth. It can be distinguished from congeners by a unique combination of characters including 12 branched caudal-fin rays, medial premaxillary tooth cusps enlarged, and a convex posterior margin of the adipose-fin membrane. With the discovery of L. jantjae, Lithoxus becomes the most recent example of {{a growing list of}} rheophilic loricariid genera with disjunct distributions on east and west sides of the Guayana Highlands. A biogeographic hypothesis relying on the existence of a proto-Berbice River uniting the southern Guayana Highlands with rivers of the central Guiana Shield is advanced to partially explain the modern distribution of these species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Toothcup</b> occurs {{throughout}} most of the United States and in southern Canada (NatureServe 2010). <b>Toothcup</b> is typically found in early successional wet habitats such as mudflats and lake, pond, and reservoir shores and almost always on newly exposed shores following water drawdowns (Mattrick 2001). Current Threats: <b>Toothcup</b> is threatened by alterations to hydrologic regime and displacement by exotic plant species. Main Factors Contributing to Vulnerability Rank: Although <b>toothcup</b> may be sensitive to certain climate change related factors addressed in the CCVI, such as changes in moisture regimes, results from the CCVI suggest that the species is Not Vulnerable/Presumed Stable. Available evidence does not suggest that abundance and/or range extent within Pennsylvania will change substantially by 2050 although actual range boundaries may change. Multiple vehicles for dispersal (e. g., wind, gravity, water, and the feet of waterfowl) and a preference towards warmer environments are characteristics that contribute to the short-term climate chang...|$|E
40|$|Roundleaf <b>toothcup</b> - Rotala rotundifolia [(Buch-Ham. ex Roxb) Koehne] is an {{important}} aquatic, ornamental and medicinal plant of family Lythraceae. Present {{study was designed to}} propagate adventitious shoots regeneration from leaf explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with 5 levels of 0. 25 - 2. 00 mg/L BA. Maximum shoot regenration frequency (53. 33 percent) and mean number of 17. 06 shoots per explant was reocrded on MS medium supplemented with 1. 0 mg/L BA. Multiple shoots buds were also induced on all culture mediums most of which were either slow to grow or failed to convert in to shoots. Transfer of explants to 0. 20 mg/L GA 3 propmoted the shoot regeneration frequecy to 100 percent on MS medium containing 1. 00 mg/L BA and increased mean number of shoots (24. 0) on MS medium supplemented with 0. 25 mg/L BA- 0. 20 mg/L GA 3. The developing shoots rooted in the shoot elongation medium showed positive effects of BA- 0. 20 mg/L GA 3 combinations. Thereafter, the developing plantlets were acclimatised in water using pH level of 4. 0 - 10 (7 levels). All plants at pH 4. 0 developed necrosis and died; whereas, rest of the plants showed variable grpwth at other pH levels. A comparison among the pH treatments suggested slightly acidic to alkaline medium (pH 6 - 9) was more appropriate for the acclimatisation of in vitro regenerated plants without having negative effects on plant growth and development...|$|E
