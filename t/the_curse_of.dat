5|$|Written by Brian Hayles, {{this was}} {{submitted}} to the production office {{during the spring of}} 1971. The story involved an Ice Warrior plan to invade the Earth using a 'Z' beam which freezes things it strikes to absolute zero. When used on humans, it turns them into zombie-like slaves.

Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions.|$|E
