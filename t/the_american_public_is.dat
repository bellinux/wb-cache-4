25|$|While the American {{working class}} has {{lost much of}} its {{political}} strength with the decline of labor unions, it remains a stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues as {{an essential part of the}} Democratic base. Today, roughly a third of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be working class with around 52% being either members of the working or lower classes. Yet, as those with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote, the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of clerical and blue-collar workers. Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended social safety net, make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base. The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the majority of those with low incomes and little education vote for the Democratic Party.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{spoke of}} the fact that he had spent 34 years in the Senate and had been active in many congressional {{committees}} including being the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and formerly holding the post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. On the campaign trail he touted his years of foreign policy experience particularly in regard to the conflict in Bosnia, which he feels he played a role in ending. Biden stated earlier in his campaign that [...] " [...] truly believe <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to say what they will do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action. Who among us is going to be able to, on Day 1, step in and end the war?" ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{penchant for}} hitting home runs altered how {{baseball}} is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games {{by getting a}} runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed [...] "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on {{the purity of the}} game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, [...] "settled, for all time to come, that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." [...] Bill James noted, [...] "When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace , then there was no turning back." [...] While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.|$|E

2500|$|February 9 - Enrique Dupuy de Lôme, the Spanish {{ambassador}} to the United States, is forced to resign after the De Lôme Letter is published in the New York Journal. This document, a private letter written to friend in Cuba, characterizes U.S. President McKinley as [...] "weak" [...] and a [...] "would-be politician" [...] who catered to the most jingoistic elements of the Republican Party and public. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> outraged at the depiction of the United States as immature, militarily weak, and lacking in diplomatic skill. The Autonomous Charter of Puerto Rico, a law approved the previous November by the Cortes (the Spanish national legislature) giving local city and provincial governments of the island nearly complete autonomy, is implemented by Spanish Governor-General Manuel Macías y Casado. The first autonomous government of Puerto Rico meets the following day.|$|E

The [...] "Round-Robin Letter" [...] appears in U.S. newspapers. Fifth Corps departed the U.S. without proper equipment, food, or medical supplies, and is suffering from extremely poor living and sanitary conditions. The letter, written by now-Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and signed by all commanders of the corps, demands {{the withdrawal of the}} corps to the U.S. before disease decimates it. Delivered to General Shafter before its publication, U.S. Secretary of War Alger has already agreed to withdraw Fifth Corps (and does so on August 3). <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> outraged by the scandalous living conditions under which the troops suffer.|$|E

60|$|But {{there are}} other things besides the {{parallel}} of Prussia or the problem of Ireland. The American press is much freer than our own; <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> much more familiar with the discussion of corruption than our own; and it is much more conscious of the corruption of our politics than we are. Almost any man in America may speak of the Marconi Case; many a man in England does not even know what it means. Many imagine that {{it had something to do}} with the propriety of politicians speculating on the Stock Exchange. So that it means a great deal to Americans to say that one figure in that drama is ruling India and another is ruling Palestine. And this brings me to another problem, which is also dealt with much more openly in America than in England. I mention it here only because it is a perfect model of the misunderstandings in the modern world. If any one asks for an example of exactly how the important part of every story is left out, and even the part that is reported is not understood, he could hardly have a stronger case than the story of Henry Ford of Detroit.|$|E

Legal experts counter that excuse defenses either serve an insignificant role in the trial or are entirely unsuccessful.

Their conclusion was: [...] "We do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments; rather, we again want to emphasize some crucial points.

In terms of benefits to women, a recently reported 30 year longitudinal study of the effect of affirmative action on hiring found that minority women benefited significantly over the entire 30 years of the study.
