5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity <b>than</b> <b>black</b> cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E

5|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with the related flame robin (P.phoenicea) and scarlet robin (P.boodang), but the male can be distinguished by its red crown (white in the other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather <b>than</b> <b>black</b> upperparts. Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter underparts.|$|E

In addition, they have also contributed to tribute albums to the manga Nana and the rock bands Luna Sea and Buck-Tick. They also perform in a live DVD by Buck-Tick.|$|E
5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern <b>than</b> <b>black</b> male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often <b>than</b> <b>Black,</b> usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer <b>than</b> <b>black</b> American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} {{bringing}} in P.A.Works as the animation studio, Toba had taken {{notice of the}} company from back when they provided in-between animation and production assistance for Fullmetal Alchemist (2003–4) and Darker <b>than</b> <b>Black</b> (2007), respectively; Aniplex helped produce both series. After watching just the first three episodes of P.A.Works' True Tears (2008), however, he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to P.A.Works' studio in Toyama Prefecture {{to meet with the}} production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together. The following week, Maeda brought up the subject of deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats! and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in P.A.Works. Shortly after that, Toba formally made the proposal to P.A.Works to animate the project.|$|E

5|$|The coat of {{the breed}} {{come in a}} variety of shades with the colours being {{separated}} into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other <b>than</b> <b>black</b> (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather <b>than</b> <b>black</b> like the body plumage.|$|E
5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} <b>than</b> <b>black</b> women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E

5|$|The {{sources of}} the two {{illustrations}} of Sydney Cove and the Aboriginal group are not known. The ceramic colouring bears a general resemblance to contemporary Sydney Cove images which implies that an original watercolour or hand coloured engraving was used for copying rather <b>than</b> <b>black</b> and white images. In {{the case of the}} Library punchbowl, the depiction of Sydney Cove is most likely done from an engraving after a now lost drawing by Lewin, which may date to 1814. This Sydney Cove engraving appeared as a full-page illustration in the second edition of A Statistical, Historical and Political Description of New South Wales and its dependent settlements in Van Diemen's Land etc (London, 1820) by Wentworth, with a later, smaller, version as one of ten Port Jackson harbour views illustrated on Map of Part of New South Wales (London, 1825) by publisher and engraver, Joseph Cross. As Australia's first professional artist, Lewin produced many paintings for Macquarie and his senior officers. He also made a number of commissions for Riley. Lewin had a close association with Antill and both were part of Governor Macquarie's 50-strong excursion party to inspect land and the new road over the Blue Mountains from 25April to 19May 1815. The road had been built by convicts in 1814, after the first European crossing by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and Wentworth in May 1813.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal <b>than</b> <b>black</b> coal. It has a lower energy density <b>than</b> <b>black</b> coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{transplant}}: There is {{one report}} of a kidney transplant rejection following the three-month use of a supplement that contained alfalfa and black cohosh. This outcome is more likely due to alfalfa <b>than</b> <b>black</b> cohosh. Alfalfa's immune system boost might make the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine less effective.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} diabetes across four different physical activity lifestyles and infer through machine learning which combinations of physical activity, sleep, stress, and body mass index yield the lowest prevalence of diabetes in Blacks and Whites. Data were extracted from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset from 2004 – 2013 containing demographics, chronic diseases, and sleep duration (N[*]=[*] 288, 888). Of the total sample, 9. 34 % reported diabetes (where the prevalence of diabetes was 12. 92 % in Blacks/African Americans and 8. 68 % in Whites). Over half of the sample reported sedentary lifestyles (Blacks were more sedentary than Whites), approximately 20 % reported moderately active lifestyles (Whites more <b>than</b> <b>Blacks),</b> approximately 15 % reported active lifestyles (Whites more <b>than</b> <b>Blacks),</b> and approximately 6 % reported very active lifestyles (Whites more <b>than</b> <b>Blacks).</b> Across four different physical activity lifestyles, Blacks consistently had a higher diabetes prevalence compared to their White counterparts. Physical activity combined with healthy sleep, low stress, and average body weight reduced the prevalence of diabetes, especially in Blacks. Our study highlights {{the need to provide}} alternative and personalized behavioral/lifestyle recommendations to generic national physical activity recommendations, specifically among Blacks, to reduce diabetes and narrow diabetes disparities between Blacks and Whites...|$|R
