This book, she claims, was based in part on an earlier work, View of the Hebrews, by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. [...] Brodie asserts that at first Smith was a deliberate impostor, who at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, became convinced that he was indeed a prophetâ€”though without ever escaping [...] "the memory of the conscious artifice" [...] that created the Book of Mormon.

40|$|Copyright Â© 2005 Academy of Dental Materials Published by Elsevier Ltd. Objective The {{ultimate}} {{success or}} failure of a restored tooth is largely dependent on clinical management. Clinicians may choose from a number of restorative materials, different clinical techniques and cavity preparation procedures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to specifically examine aspects of the material choice holding other factors constant. Methods The current paper adopts a fundamental result in the linear theory of elasticity on the singular stress distribution in a bi-materials wedge to analyze the fracture susceptibility of different materials used for the restoration of a tooth. Results Comparable results are reported for amalgam, gold alloys and ceramic materials. It is shown that due to a wide variety of mechanical properties the application of resin-based composites could lead to improved or less fracture resistance of the restored tooth. Significance This variety in the mechanical properties for resin-based composites could be partially responsible for <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidences</b> reported by different clinical studies. The present work contributes evidence from an analytical model to assist the restorative dentist in selection of an appropriate restorative material and guide the manufacturing companies on the preferred physical properties of newer designed materials.
