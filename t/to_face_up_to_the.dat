5|$|During the decade, Themistocles {{continued}} to advocate {{the expansion of}} Athenian naval power. The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended; Darius's son and successor, Xerxes I, had continued the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Themistocles seems to have realised that for the Greeks to survive the coming onslaught required a Greek navy that could hope <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Persian navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet. Aristides, as champion of the zeugites (the upper, 'hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.|$|E

25|$|The growth {{pace that}} the Moroccan economy {{witnessed}} {{since the beginning}} of the 1998–2007 decade has generated significant progress in terms of national income, employment and living standards. However, the results obtained show considerable disparities in terms of the distribution of the fruit of this growth, whether between the production factors, the socio-economic groups or the urban and rural areas. In fact, the national income grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% during the 1998–2007 decade. This improvement in the national income however seems to be insufficient <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discrepancies in terms of living standards and the scale of deficits at the social level.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{uncontrolled}} public {{decisions have}} led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes {{the rule of law}} by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.|$|E
25|$|Mehmet {{proceeds}} {{to make things}} infinitely worse for himself soon after, when he stakes his house and business on a bet, loses and swiftly disappears leaving his wife, Guizin (Ishia Bennison), <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consequences. A then homeless Guzin arrives at Ali and his wife Sue's (Sandy Ratcliff) doorstep {{with the news that}} Mehmet had beaten her, and she isn't ever returning to him. Ali and Sue are forced to take Guizin and her three children, Murat, Rayif and Emine (Pelin Ahmet) into their one bedroom apartment. Mehmet returns to Walford in May 1987 and he manages to persuade his long suffering wife to give their marriage another chance. However, his promises to Guizin prove to be hollow as soon after he decides that the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) is to be the next sexual conquest. Donna refuses his advances, but can't resist informing Guizin about his offer and Guizin and Donna nearly fight on New Year's Eve that year. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. In 1988 Mehmet and Guzin become partners in Ali's café after Sue gives up working to look after her baby. Mehmet often clashes with his wife about the amount of time he takes off to gamble and the way the café is run. Later in the year Mehmet and Ali run up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, and who {{is also a member of}} the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money the two turn to their café employee, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), for a loan. He agrees, but charges his employers 10 percent interest and later, when they cannot meet the repayments, he demands a stake in the café. The brothers refuse, but the debt eventually leads to Ali losing the café to Ian the following year.|$|E

500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, {{prominent}} Latin American dictators {{have included the}} Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, among others. As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized. As García Calderon noted {{as far back as}} 1925: [...] "Does it want peace or is it controlled by certain interests?" [...] As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism {{and the power of the}} tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people. In the case of Trujillo, [...] "Nothing promises to reinvigorate his flagging popularity more than <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Yankee aggressor in the name of la patria." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Quietus, Amy Pettifer {{praised the}} album, {{describing}} it as: [...] "a darker {{return to the}} club culture roots , and it seems– on some level– <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> missteps of her more recent releases". Giving it 3.5 out of 4 stars, USA Today writer Elysa Gardner described the album's sound and lyrics as [...] "piercingly direct". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot and Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times awarded it 3 out of 4 stars. Kot believed that the album {{would have been better}} without the songs referencing sexuality, but still considered it to be [...] "fascinating" [...] while Roberts believed that Rebel Heart stood out [...] "sturdily" [...] because of its production. Writing for The Boston Globe, James Reed opined that the album was a: [...] "welcome detour in the artist's recent discography... her most satisfying effort in a decade and nimbly connects the dots between Madonna's various eras and guises". Critic Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called Rebel Heart: [...] "a complex, consistently strong album".|$|E
500|$|Both the House and Senate passed SOF reform bills, {{and these}} {{went to a}} conference {{committee}} for reconciliation. Senate and House conferees forged a compromise. The bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four-star general for all SOF, an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a coordinating board for low-intensity conflict within the National Security Council, and a new Major Force Program (MFP-11) for SOF (the so-called [...] "SOF checkbook"). The final bill, attached as a rider to the 1987 Defense Authorization Act, amended the Goldwater-Nichols Act and {{was signed into law}} in October 1986. Congress clearly intended to force DOD and the Administration <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realities of past failures and emerging threats. DOD and the Administration were responsible for implementing the law, and Congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation. The legislation promised to improve SOF in several respects. Once implemented, MFP-11 provided SOF with control over its own resources, better enabling it to modernize the force. Additionally, the law fostered interservice cooperation: a single commander for all SOF promoted interoperability among the forces assigned to the same command. The establishment of a four-star Commander in Chief and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict eventually gave SOF a voice in the highest councils of the Defense Department.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{controversy}} Hitler's War generated, it was a best-seller in 1977. In particular, Hitler's War was a best-seller in Germany The American author Gill Seidel summed up the appeal of Hitler's War to Germans as:"It {{is not difficult to}} explain its appeal. The argument of the book may be summed up as: [...] "If only the Führer had known about the murder of the Jews, he would had stopped it'.

2500|$|Tout also {{introduced}} original {{research into the}} undergraduate programme, culminating {{in the production of}} a Final Year thesis based on primary sources. This horrified Oxbridge, where college tutors had little research capacity of their own and saw the undergraduate as an embryonic future gentleman, liberal connoisseur, widely read, and mainstay of country and empire in politics, commerce, army, land or church, not an apprentice to dusty, centuries-old archives, wherein no more than 1 in 100 could find even an innocuous career. In taking this view they had a fair case, given the various likelihoods and opportunities for their charges. Tout's ally C. H. Firth fought a bitter campaign to persuade Oxford to follow Manchester and introduce scientific study of sources into the History programme, but failed; there was failure too, at Cambridge. Other universities, however, followed Tout, and Oxbridge, but very slowly, [...] had <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact, and fundamental changes to the selection of college fellows across all disciplines ensued.|$|E
