500|$|The Common Pleas' {{jurisdiction}} {{was over}} [...] "common pleas," [...] {{cases where the}} king had no interest. This in practice meant cases between subject and subject, including all actions taken under praecipe to recover debts or property, which made up {{the vast majority of}} civil cases. As such, the Common Pleas [...] "was the court which more than any other shaped the medieval common law". It was the court where most students went to learn, and the majority of the early case reports come from the Common Pleas. The court was called [...] "the lock and key of the common law" [...] by Sir Edward Coke, since throughout its history it was the only court where claims involving real property could be brought, giving it a wider remit <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>precedent</b> than the other courts. For almost all of its history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of audience in the Court of Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister, Serjeant or not, and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid. The Serjeants only enjoyed their returned status for another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers to practice in the Court of Common Pleas.|$|E

40|$|Exploring {{human rights}} {{violations}} in areas of conflict is a very challenging endeavor as the consequences of conflict wreak havoc on communities and the built environment. When sacred space, specifically, has been intentionally and maliciously damaged, a group's right to cultural heritage has been potentially violated. As laid out by numerous international covenants, this is a denial of basic human rights. Therefore, using international human rights laws <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>precedents,</b> definitions and guidelines, the preservation of a sacred space after intentional damage can help protect those rights and rectify a wrong committed against a group. Studying the racially motivated bombing of 16 th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama {{as a case study}} and using human rights legislation to frame preservation work in general, the inherent yet complicated connection between historic preservation and human rights can be explored and understood...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{defendant}} presented multiple arguments in his defense, the Court {{was able to}} reverse Georgia's decision using just one of them. A distinction was drawn by the Court between public display and private possession of obscenity. Neither Roth nor any other case at the time set a precedent for private possession of obscenity. The Court thus decided <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>precedent</b> on this issue in this case. Roth dealt with the mailing and advertising of obscenity. A companion case, Alberts v. California, involved the advertising and sale of obscene materials. All earlier cases were decided with the negative externality of obscenity in mind. They reasoned {{that members of the}} public, especially impressionable children, should have a valid expectation to not be inadvertently exposed to obscenity. Public display of obscenity was deemed an [...] "important interest" [...] in Roth. Private possession was not as interesting {{in the eyes of the}} Court.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the work}} began, Ryan {{had to contend}} with {{widespread}} disagreement on many important issues. Some felt the effort to expel World War II war criminals was important both to achieve justice and <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>precedent</b> for the future, while others felt that the time had passed for pursuit of these aims. [...] Some Justice Department officials felt OSI should have a Jewish Director, while others did not want the office to be viewed as a Jewish organization and favored Ryan in part because he was not Jewish. Eastern European nationality groups opposed OSI's use of evidence from the USSR, which had an interest in discrediting Baltic State, Ukrainian, and other emigre groups and might well provide false information and forged documents to achieve their aims. [...] These emigre groups also challenged the use of the lower standard of evidence involved in civil trials compared to criminal trials, even though citizenship revocation and deportation were civil issues and US law at the time did not provide for criminal penalties for crimes committed on foreign soil unless against US citizens. [...] The emigres also feared that OSI might seek to deport anyone who had lied on their entry applications, not just the wartime persecutors that Ryan sought to expel. [...] In contrast, Jewish groups were pressing for more determined action by OSI than INS had demonstrated. It became clear that leading OSI was going to involve a lot of public relations work as well as research and prosecution.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{utilities}} industry, the Prudent Investment Rule {{refers to a}} series of state standards which determine the fiscal soundness of a utility in the course of rate recovery for recoverable capital costs to be determined by that state’s Public Service Commission (PSC). The determination is established through a series of filings from the utility to the PSC and hearings conducted by the PSC. This occurs during a prudency hearing. [...] The PSC follows these standards to determine if the capital costs were a [...] "prudent investment". To determine the prudency of the investment, the PSC applies the prudent investment test or standard, determining if the costs were reasonable at the time they were incurred, and given the circumstances and what was known or knowable at the time, are {{to be included in the}} firm's rates. [...] It is commonly used as an oversight tool by the government to ensure that money invested into a project is being spent as it was intended so the utility may recoup some costs in construction through a recovery in rates, hence the title prudent investment rule. Regulators can consider cases of hidden imprudence, but are required to consider what was known or knowable at the time the decision was made by the PSC. The term Prudent Investment Rule, and the associated standards, have been established through a series of legal precedents. The first case <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>precedent</b> was the United States Supreme Court case of Munn v. Illinois in 1877, which allowed states to have a say in rates. [...] Once the nature of recoverable capital costs was defined, a second question remained as to the rate at which that capital could be recovered. This issue was reasonably addressed in 1935 in Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, when the court said that a public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties.|$|E

The introduction gives a general overview of the problem and some insight as to our (Dan, Eric, and myself) attitude toward this project. I have included explanations of those items I feel are required in health, viable, exciting residential designs. My brief explains the various stratigies or concepts required for a development of this type. Certain amenities are present here, which are not ordinarily present in resident developments in this area such as golf and water recreations. We organized our design to emphasize these amenities and allow for maximum participation. The proposal itself starts with various alternatives and, then, logically-pursues the most reasonable alternative. From this alternative I establish the area where the most major problems occurred. This area became the target for my thesis design. From the brief I drew the major concepts for this area and progressed to preliminary design stage. After the preliminary jury I modified the design in response to the jury statements. My final design is representative of this entire year's work. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B.

40|$|There is {{a global}} trend of {{increase}} in urban population growth rates. Much of the population growth occurs in cities of developing countries, with high percentages of the populations living in informal settlements on the peripheries of cities. The often unplanned expansion of cities is increasingly exposing {{a large number of}} urban residents and economic assets to disaster risk. The City of Cape Town (CCT) is no exception to the rapid expansion of informal settlements. Heavy winter rainfall leads to flooding in Cape Town, with severe flooding impacts mainly manifesting in low income settlements. Flooding occurs due to the natural setting of Cape Town, and due to lack of adequate water-related infrastructure {{in some parts of the}} city. Although infrastructure interventions for flood risk reduction have had some success in reducing flood impacts in some parts of Cape Town, much of the local government response to flooding disasters has been reactive, short term and generally not designed to effectively support informal settlements. The township of Philippi is highly impacted by flooding events, which often compromise the township's safety and public health, and destroy livelihood assets, leaving adverse impacts on local livelihoods. This dissertation uses Philippi as a case study to assess and investigate how an infrastructure-led planning approach to flood risk can provide solutions and contribute to building better adaptive capacity to flooding, for a rapidly growing population exposed to flooding and lacking adequate water infrastructure services. Utilizing policy review, key informant interviews, Census data, geospatial data mapping and observation, this study identifies the major impediments to enhancement of flood resilience through infrastructure planning in Philippi. It explores the opportunities and potential that Philippi has <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>precedent</b> for flood-resilient developments in Cape Town. A Spatial Flood Resilience Framework is presented as a spatial planning tool providing an infrastructure-led planning approach to flood risk and guiding decision-making towards effectively making Philippi more floodresilient. The study highlights the need for risk-informed local plans to reduce disaster risk in Cape Town and identifies collaborative governance as a significant aspect of the planning and implementation processes for flood risk reduction, as it integrates different actors in working towards a common agenda. This study aims to identify and improve the role of urban planning in moving towards flood resilient neighbourhoods in Cape Town. The study highlights the role of planning in ensuring that development avoids or mitigates flood risk, and identifies flood resilience as a valuable aspect of the spatial quality of a city. Enhancing flood resilience is an essential premise for the facilitation of development in areas of disaster risk and a major step toward socio-spatial justice in the city. The research conducted for the study contributes to the Global South research base and provides a possible precedent for future spatial development plans regarding flood risk in cities of the Global South...|$|E

In this context, our laboratory was interested in investigating protein modifications {{in the presence of}} select naphthoquinones, which were 2 -hydroxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (HNQ) and 1, 2 -naphthoquinone (o-NQ). The effects of HNQ and o-NQ on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase) were investigated through a variety of conditions. These modified incubation conditions included pH variation and the addition of metal ions to further mimic physiological conditions. Documentation of results was carried out through sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis (SDS-PAGE). Of the two quinones, o-NQ exhibited a greater level of activity toward RNase. HNQ was found to be stable under the studied conditions, resulting in almost no observed RNase modification.
