Low-aspect-ratio configurations can be found with robust vacuum flux surfaces and rotational transform close to the transform of a reverse-shear tokamak. These configurations have clear advantages in minimizing disruptions and their effect and in reducing tokamak current drive needs. They also allow the study of low-aspect-ratio effects on stellarator confinement in small devices...|$|R

5000|$|For small SMES, {{solenoids}} {{are usually}} used {{because they are}} easy to coil and no pre-compression is needed. In toroidal SMES, the coil is always under compression by the outer hoops and two disks, one of which is on the top and the other is on the bottom to avoid breakage. Currently, there is little need for toroidal geometry for small SMES, but as the size increases, mechanical forces become more important and the <b>toroidal</b> <b>coil</b> is needed.|$|E
50|$|The H-1 {{flexible}} Heliac is a three field-period helical axis stellarator {{located in}} the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering at Canberra, Australia. Optimisation of the H-1 power supplies for low current ripple allows precise control of the ratio of secondary (helical, vertical) coil to primary (poloidal, <b>toroidal)</b> <b>coil</b> currents, resulting in a finely tunable magnetic geometry. Slight variation in the current ratio between shots (plasma discharges) in a sequence corresponds to a high resolution parameter scan through magnetic configurations (i.e.: rotational transform profile, magnetic well). The programmable control system allows for repetition rates of around 30 shots per hour, limited by data acquisition time and magnet cooling time.|$|E
40|$|The PLT <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coil</b> power {{tests were}} {{initiated}} in October, 1974 to gain information in several areas.

40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of superconducting magnets that are {{key elements of}} a fusion reactor must be ensured. At an early design stage relatively simple calculation tools can greatly facilitate design optimization. The main objective {{of this paper is}} the mechanical pre-dimensioning of the tokamak <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coils</b> by simple means prior to the global 3 D numerical modeling. A semi-analytical calculation tool that reasonably estimates the static strength of the <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coil</b> under the electromagnetic forces at the critical location (inner leg equatorial plane) is described. The novelty of the approach is that it treats not only the massive coil casing but also the winding pack conductor jacket under an essentially 3 D stress state. The calculation tool features pre-optimization of the coil winding for graded layered winding layouts. The minimum space (radial built) required for the coil inboard portion that is a key design parameter is defined after possible winding pre-optimization. The procedure has been successfully benchmarked against numerical solutions and has been used for pre-dimensioning the <b>toroidal</b> <b>coils</b> in the frame of the current 2015 DEMO activity...|$|R

50|$|More recently, {{low-cost}} current sensors {{based on}} the principle of a Rogowski coil have been developed. These sensors share the principles of a Rogowski coil, measuring the rate of change of current using a transformer with no magnetic core. The difference from the traditional Rogowski coil is that the sensor can be manufactured using a planar coil rather than a <b>toroidal</b> <b>coil.</b> In order to reject the influence of conductors outside the sensor's measurement region, these planar Rogowski current sensors use a concentric coil geometry instead of a toroidal geometry to limit the response to external fields. The main advantage of the planar Rogowski current sensor is that the coil winding precision that is a requirement for accuracy can be achieved using low-cost printed circuit board manufacturing.|$|E

40|$|The center {{column of}} the PLT machine is a {{secondary}} support member for the <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coils.</b> Its {{purpose is to}} decrease the bending moment at {{the nose of the}} coils. The center column design was to have been a stainless steel casting with the <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coils</b> grouped around the casting at installation, trapping it in place. However, the castings developed cracks during fabrication and were unsuitable for use. Installation of the coils proceeded without the center column. It then became necessary to redesign a center column which would be capable of installation with the <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coils</b> in place. The final design consists of three A- 286 forgings.

40|$|Generally {{speaking}} for a HTS coil, perpendicular magnetic field to conductor's broad surface should be suppressed {{as small as}} possible {{in relation to the}} magnetic anisotropy. This is a reason why <b>toroidal</b> <b>coil</b> with relatively many elementary coils is expected for HTS-SMES. On the other hand, {{from the point of view}} of the homogenization of critical current distribution in the coil, perpendicular field and parallel field should be balanced corresponding to the ratio of the magnetic anisotropy. This means that a certain level of the perpendicular field is effective to reduce local heat generation in the coil. Furthermore, this concept is especially reasonable for a high-field coil with usual winding method (flat-wise winding) because the perpendicular field does not induce hoop stress which decreases the critical current. In this paper, we show these findings through an optimal design of a MOCVD-YBCO <b>toroidal</b> <b>coil</b> for 2 GJ class SMES taking account of magnetically and mechanically influenced J - E characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A <b>toroidal</b> field <b>coil</b> (TFC) is {{composed}} of several individual <b>toroidal</b> <b>coils</b> (ITCs), which are connected in a series and distributed in a toroidal and symmetrical form. Cross section of ITCs is rectangular or negligible. This paper presents analytical equations for mutual inductance of two ITCs applicable to Tokamak reactors using the filament method. These equations are based on those formulated by Neumann. The numerical analysis of the integrations resulting from these equations is solved using the extended three-point Gaussian algorithm. The finite element method (FEM) is employed to verify the mutual inductance equations of ITCs. The results obtained using the FEM, when dimensional parameters of ITCs are changed, confirm the analytical and empirical results showing an error of less than 0. 2043 % in the worst case. This indicates {{the reliability of the}} presented equations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{formulas}} {{are proposed}} for the self- and mutual-inductance calculations of a helical <b>toroidal</b> <b>coil</b> by direct and indirect methods at superconductivity conditions. The direct method {{is based on the}} Neumann’s equation, and the indirect approach is based on the toroidal and the poloidal components of the magnetic flux density. Numerical calculations show that the direct method is more accurate than the indirect approach at the expense of its longer computational time. Implementation of some engineering assumptions in the indirect method is shown to reduce the computational time without loss of accuracy. Comparison between the experimental, empirical, and numerical results for inductance, using the direct and the indirect methods, indicates that the proposed formulas have high reliability. It is also shown that the self-inductance and mutual inductance could be calculated in the same way, provided that the radius of curvature is greater than 0. 4 of the minor radius and that the definition of the geometric mean radius in the superconductivity conditions is used. Plotting contours for the magnetic flux density and the inductance show that the inductance formulas of the helical <b>toroidal</b> <b>coil</b> could be used as the basis for coil optimal design. Optimization target functions such as maximization of the ratio of stored magnetic energy with respect to the volume of the toroid or the conductor’s mass, the elimination or the balance of stress in certain coordinate directions, and the attenuation of leakage flux could be considered.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{is focused on}} research, design, implementation and testing of systems {{for the application of}} magnetic vector potential to biological materials. The main objective was to analyze and design systems which could generate magnetic vector potential without the presence of other unwanted fields or at least amplify its intensity. Moreover, the systems designed had to eliminate other foreign effects on the biological samples, especially the influence of waste heat from the <b>coils.</b> <b>Toroidal</b> <b>coils</b> were employed to generate the vector potential, because they confine the unwanted magnetic induction inside their core thanks to their shape. The thesis employed coils with two different outer diameters, specifically 102 and 600 mm. To excite the coils, four current pulse generators capable of delivering currents of up to 100 A were constructed. The systems’ generated fields were comprehensively analyzed with the help of finite-element simulations in ANSYS. To simplify the design phase, analytical equations for the calculation of vector potential intensity at an arbitrary point around the <b>toroidal</b> <b>coils</b> were also derived. A method employing electromagnetic shielding made of two different materials was developed to suppress the unwanted fields. To eliminate the influence of heat, the 102 mm system employed air cooling and the 600 mm system employed a closed water loop to equalize the temperatures of biological samples. The biological effects of both systems were tested on genetically modified bio-luminescent bacteria Escherichia coli K 12 luxABCDEamp.
