6000|$|... "To {{modify the}} human constitution, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} first, to frame the ideal, and thereafter <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with all the resources of science.|$|E
50|$|The able-bodied poor were <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a House of Industry. Materials {{were to be}} {{provided}} for the poor <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{instantly}} {{slipped in}} {{a sheet of}} foolscap, and began to type-write with alarming speed--click, click, click; while Elsie, rising <b>to</b> the occasion, <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> transcribe imaginary shorthand as if her life depended upon it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay," [...] Abe replied, [...] "rich {{enough for}} anything. There are the {{boundaries}} of our claims, lads, and ye are welcome <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> below them." ...|$|E
60|$|On Captain Crosbie’s arrival {{the admiral}} {{told him that}} Stephen was ready <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at once, in any {{capacity}} in which he could make himself useful.|$|E
6000|$|... "We breakfast about {{a quarter}} to six, but I daresay you won't {{want to get up}} as early as that. You see, we have <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh!' cried Guy, eagerly, 'to be sure I {{delight in}} Homer and the Georgics, and plenty more. What splendid things {{there are in}} these old fellows! But, I never liked the {{drudgery}} part of the affair; and now if I am <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be accurate, and to get up all the grammar and the Greek roots, it will be horrid enough in all conscience.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{immediately}} <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> {{complete it}} {{according to my}} original purpose.|$|R

6000|$|... "And can nothing be done? Would it be any use {{whatever}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on any line you can suggest? I {{would make it}} my own business, and follow up any clue you could give me." ...|$|E
60|$|And the two {{old ladies}} <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> a good dish of scandal.|$|R
60|$|So, {{under the}} circumstances, {{you could not}} blame him much, if he did rip a little, for it would have tried old Job's temper, <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> making {{a fire in the}} water.|$|R
5000|$|... "Stephanie's {{contract}} was terminated following warnings for lateness, attendance {{and after a}} final incident in which she turned up <b>to</b> <b>set</b> unfit <b>to</b> <b>work</b> because of alcohol consumption". Her final scenes aired on 18 September 2015.|$|R

60|$|Once {{only did}} Lancelot break {{out with his}} real sentiments when the banker was {{planning}} how to re-establish his credit; <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> in fact, to blow over again the same bubble which had already burst under him.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{at once to}} {{discover}} my family. I have not been to my lawyer yet, so I don’t know how much he has done, but I certainly mean {{to go into the}} business in earnest.” ...|$|E

60|$|Early in the {{following}} week Miss Carew returned to Wiltstoken.

60|$|At length, Jonas {{urged the}} {{necessity}} for a halt, for rest and food. They chose a spot {{at the foot of}} a great tree, and then <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> collect a store of firewood. John took out the box of tinder which, in those days, everyone carried about with him, and a fire was soon lighted.

60|$|The {{answer was}} not very comforting to a man of Leroy's temperament. He {{stumbled}} on, and they came now upon the Place du Bouffay, where the red guillotine loomed in ghostly outline, and headed towards the Quai Tourville. Thence they were marched by the river the whole length of the Quai La Fosse. Fear spreading amongst them, some clamours were raised, to be instantly silenced by blows and assurances {{that they were to}} be shipped to Belle Isle, where they were <b>to</b> be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> build a fort.|$|R
60|$|Thus an {{hour was}} passed. It was now noon, and Joe and Darry <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> prepare dinner for themselves.|$|R
