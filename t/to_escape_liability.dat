The pre-requirements essential for establishing a liability under the principle of strict liability viz., the non-natural use of land, use of a dangerous thing, and the element of escape provided substantial loopholes to the enterprises <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> under the Rylands v.

2500|$|Article 4 {{implies that}} the High Court may void a piece of {{legislation}} to the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution. At present, it is unclear how the Court will apply this requirement. If, say, an entire piece of criminal legislation or one of its provisions is found to be void, a person alleged to have committed an offence created by the impugned legislation may be able <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability.</b> To circumvent this, a test of severability, also known as the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test, has been established in the UK. If the unconstitutional parts of the legislation are severable from the constitutional parts, the latter are preserved and remain valid and enforceable. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hutchinson (1988), the House of Lords held that two forms of severability must be established for a law to be held partially valid– textual severability and substantial severability. A provision is textually severable if it remains grammatical and correct after severance. It is substantially severable if its substance after severance remains true to its [...] "legislative purpose, operation and effect". However, the court also recognized that a rigid adherence to the test of textual severability may result in unreasonable consequences. It may defeat legislation with a substantial purpose clearly within the lawmaker's power but, by oversight, which was written in a way that exceeded that scope of power. Hence, the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test may still apply to rescue a provision that is not textually severable {{as long as it does}} not alter the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision.|$|E

50|$|On the one hand, the {{law does}} not want {{individuals}} <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> for the natural and probable consequences of their conduct.

5000|$|Another {{consequence}} of this case was that the employer's rebuttal as to the question whether a discriminatory judgment was the [...] "but-for" [...] reason for the decision could be made with only a [...] "preponderance of the evidence", {{as opposed to the}} prior standard of [...] "clear and convincing evidence," [...] a reduction in the burden of proof for employers who wish <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability.</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{is clear}} that the office of {{trusteeship}} is an onerous one. The traditional image of trusteeship would suggest a number of important duties, both positive and negative, are imposed upon trustees. A trustee is obliged to discharge these duties with utmost diligence in order <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> personal <b>liability</b> for breach of trust. Standing in a fiduciary relationship to his beneficiary, a trustee is expected to observe the highest standards of integrity and an objective standard of care when managing the trust. An increasingly important question in trust law is whether {{and the extent to which}} it is possible to exempt a trustee from liability from liability for breach of trust. In the light of modern trusteeship where the professional trustee performs his duties as part of a commercial undertaking this question becomes particularly important for the business lawyer...|$|R
50|$|On June 4, 1921, {{the legal}} {{doctrine}} of superior orders was {{used during the}} German Military Trials that took place after World War I: One {{of the most famous}} of these trials was the matter of Lieutenant Karl Neumann, who was a U-boat captain responsible for the sinking of the hospital ship the Dover Castle. Even though he frankly admitted to having sunk the ship, he stated that he had done so on the basis of orders supplied to him by the German Admiralty and so he could not be held liable for his actions. The Reichsgericht, then Germany's supreme court, acquitted him, accepting the defense of superior orders as a grounds <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> criminal <b>liability.</b> Further, that very court had this to say in the matter of superior orders:... that all civilized nations recognize the principle that a subordinate is covered by the orders of his superiors.|$|R

50|$|As fiduciaries, the {{directors}} may not {{put themselves in}} a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company.

Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.|$|E
50|$|Morris insists:A {{patentee}} of {{a combination}} or process should retain the rights of his patent monopoly, without relinquishing any of the control inherent in the right, even though part of his complex invention is notpatentable. The Court has seen that in today's industrial world, a nonstaple item (as defined by section 271(c)) should not dictate any narrowing of the patent privilege, for by definition it is used solely with the patented invention. More importantly, infringers of the patent should {{not be permitted to}} rely on thequirks of patentability <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> for their acts.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the first article-length {{treatment of the}} legal rules that enable uninsured and underinsured individuals <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> tort <b>liability</b> by sheltering their income and assets from collection. These legal barriers to collecting tort judgments include limits on wage garnishment, homestead exemptions, retirement-plan exemptions, discharge in bankruptcy, spendthrift trusts, offshore asset protection trusts, and more. Of course, indigent persons would be judgment-proof even without these rules, because they have so few assets and so little income. Contrary to the myth of personal tort liability that is standard in torts scholarship and teaching, however, these legal rules enable huge numbers of working-class, middle-class, and affluent people to be (or become) judgment-proof {{despite the fact that}} they have decent incomes and significant assets that could be used to satisfy a tort judgment. The article describes the most important of these judgment-proofing rules in depth, demonstrates that they seriously undermine the deterrence and corrective justice goals of tort law, argues that they lack any persuasive justification, proposes specific reforms to reduce the judgment-proof problem, and evaluates the political feasibility of this agenda. It also discusses the important role of liability insurance in dealing with the residual threat of personal tort liability, and suggests ways in which increased use of mandatory liability insurance could contribute to solving the judgment-proof problem...|$|R

50|$|In 1872, alcohol {{regulation}} reached {{new heights}} {{in the state}} {{with the passage of}} the Graham Law. This legislation prohibited drunkenness and the sale of alcohol to minors, and required all liquor sellers to post a $2,000 bond (more than $30,000 in 2007 U.S. dollars). German-Americans fought the new law in the courts and at the ballot box. Although they lost challenges in the courts, they were able to elect a legislature friendlier to alcohol consumption. In 1874, the new lawmakers passed less restrictive laws that lowered the bond to $500, allowed Sunday liquor sales, and created certain safe havens for liquor sellers <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> for alcoholics.|$|E
50|$|What remains {{uncertain}} {{is how the}} Fourth Circuit {{applies the}} law decided by the Court to {{the facts of the}} case. Should the Fourth Circuit broadly accept evidence fulfilling the plaintiff’s showing on the significant burden/sufficiently strong prong, more claims will be successful. However, should the Fourth Circuit maintain a narrow approach to the significant burden/sufficiently strong elements, less claims will be successful {{as a result of the}} Court’s liberal interpretation of acceptable employer behavior. Allowing employers <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> would widen the gap between pregnancy-related accommodation seekers and non-pregnancy related accommodation seekers, and subsequently diminish the formal equality assumption that underscores the case.|$|E
40|$|Currently many American {{corporations}} must pursue {{and develop}} international business relationships. For these American firms, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) {{is the most}} important U. S. law governing international commerce. The FCPA prohibits firms from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business in a foreign country. Despite its infrequent use during {{the last quarter of the}} twentieth century, Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions under the statute have exploded in the last few years. Due to this increase in enforcement and the difficulties in complying with the FCPA, the anti-bribery statute has caused American firms to avoid foreign markets and prospective growth areas, creating a competitive imbalance for U. S. companies. This Article proposes an adequate procedures defense as the best way to fix this imbalance and allow American corporations to operate efficiently overseas without the cloud of FCPA liability hanging over them. The defense would allow American firms <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> FCPA <b>liability</b> upon showing that they had adequate procedures in place designed to detect and prevent international bribery. To be sure, Congress has recently considered amending the FCPA to add a similar defense, and others have suggested that Congress take such action. However, this piece goes further in so much as it proposes specific statutory language that Congress could use in adopting such a defense and it establishes precise factors to be promulgated by the DOJ and SEC for determining whether a firm’s procedure would be deemed “adequate. ” Lastly, the Article details projected outcomes associated with American firms being able to use the adequate procedures defense...|$|R
25|$|As theorists such as Ronald Coase {{have pointed}} out, all {{business}} organizations represent {{an attempt to}} avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide limited liability to both {{members of the organization}} and external investors. Business organizations originated with agency law, which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> the full <b>liability</b> imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behavior.|$|R

Instead, just as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company 1893, the court applies the [...] "objective test" [...] and asks whether the reasonable bystander, after taking into account all the circumstances of the case, thinks that the parties intended to be bound.

One day, he suffered a fit while driving and collided with a pedestrian and another car. Someone was badly hurt. He was charged with and convicted of reckless or negligent driving—not because he was epileptic, but because he had chosen to drive when a reasonable person would have foreseen the likelihood of a fit and its consequences. He should not in the circumstances have driven at all.

50|$|The federal right {{given an}} {{individual}} under the Federal Employers Liability Act and {{the parameters of}} such must be determined by federal law because under federal law, a release is not valid if it has been procured by false or misleading statements. Applying Ohio law, which would thus make the release valid if Plaintiff was negligent in not reading it, would defeat the purpose of FELA of giving employees a right to recover damages against their employers. In addition, there is a federal policy of not allowing individuals <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> through fraudulently obtained releases. Plaintiff has a right under FELA and the Seventh Amendment to a trial by jury. This cannot be taken away by Ohio’s law giving the judge permission to decide the issue of fraud {{in the context of}} a release.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Given the {{substantial}} enforcement costs of public {{authorities and the}} possible failure of liability, the joint use of regulation and liability is advanced. In case of a regulation violation, the imposition of punitive damages under a strict liability regime will give potential violators a strong incentive {{to comply with the}} law and save the enforcement costs as well by creating a discontinuous costs-function for potential violators. Under a negligence rule, the effect of imposing such punitive damages might not be as strong as under a strict liability rule, and it may exert stronger impact in one situation where the probability of <b>escaping</b> <b>liability</b> is high enough. For the amount of damages, in principle, it should be based upon the reciprocal to the probability of <b>escaping</b> <b>liability...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{contract}} defenses are duress, unconscionability, incapacity, fraud, {{and the basic}} assumption. defenses 4 of mutual mistake, unilateral mistake, impossibility, frustration of purpose and commercial impracticability. In this Article, I limit my discussion to basic assumption defenses. Several prevailing rationales explain why a party should be allowed <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> contractual <b>liability</b> despite the sufficiency of consideration {{where there has been}} a failure of a basic assumption material to the transaction. No single rationale or principle, however, unifies all basic assumption defenses. Several commentators have noted that similar fact patterns applying a given doctrine often yield inconsistent results. Parties’ employment of these defenses, and courts’ analyses of them, is often confusing and inaccurate. This Article proposes that basic assumption defenses can best be explained and analyzed through the prism of contractual intent. Although typically discussed in terms of a singular concept, contractual intent in fact comprises various facets, which I refer to as volitional intent, cognitive intent, and contextual purposive intent. Part II provides an introduction to, and description of, my proposed expanded intent analysis. Part III applies expanded intent analysis to cases involving basic assumption defenses. Part IV addresses possible concerns with using a dynamic approach/expanded intent analysis. This Article concludes that adopting my proposed intent-based analysis has several advantages over the current application of contract defenses. First and foremost, it directly addresses and incorporates contract law’s two primary objectives: furthering autonomy and facilitating transactions. Second, because it removes artificial doctrinal distinctions, it eliminates or minimizes confusion and simplifies analysis. Consequently, it provides for greater consistency in judicial decisions. Finally, the approach is flexible, and therefore better accommodates technological advancements, such as the Internet, in the modern marketplace...|$|R

5000|$|The {{importance}} of the force majeure clause in a contract, particularly one of any length in time, cannot be overstated as it relieves a party from an obligation under the contract (or suspends that obligation). What is permitted to be a force majeure event or circumstance can {{be the source of}} much controversy in the negotiation of a contract and a party should generally resist any attempt by the other party to include something that should, fundamentally, be at the risk of that other party. For example, in a coal-supply agreement, the mining company may seek to have [...] "geological risk" [...] included as a force majeure event; however, the mining company should be doing extensive exploration and analysis of its geological reserves and should not even be negotiating a coal-supply agreement if it cannot take the risk {{that there may be a}} geological limit to its coal supply from time to time. The outcome of that negotiation, of course, depends on the relative bargaining power of the parties and there will be cases where force majeure clauses can be used by a party effectively <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> <b>liability</b> for bad performance.|$|E
