5|$|In 1847, the Whitman {{massacre}} and the Cayuse War in {{what became}} southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers {{throughout the region}} {{and led to the}} formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight Indians. Along <b>the</b> <b>Rogue,</b> tensions intensified in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when hundreds of men from the Oregon Territory passed through <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Valley on their way to the Sacramento River basin. After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Valley for white miners and settlers.|$|E
5|$|Against his will, Gygax {{was back}} in charge again; he {{immediately}} looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had retained the rights to Gord <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> {{as part of his}} severance agreement with TSR, so he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new novels beginning with Sea of Death (1987); sales were brisk, and Gygax's Gord <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> novels ended up keeping New Infinities in business.|$|E
5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
50|$|During {{the events}} of Final Crisis, <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> {{rejected}} membership into the Secret Society offered by Libra. With Libra desperate to induct all of the Flash's villains, he recruits <b>the</b> New <b>Rogues,</b> who had first appeared as the Penguin's goons, to force <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> to join. <b>The</b> members consisted of: Chill, Burn, Weather Witch, Mirror-Man, and Mr. Magic. <b>The</b> New <b>Rogues</b> had captured Captain Cold's father and were threatening to kill him if <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> did not report to Libra. <b>The</b> <b>Rogues</b> then attacked <b>the</b> New <b>Rogues,</b> killing each one.|$|R
50|$|In Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge, <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> {{withdraw}} from Libra's society and plot to {{take revenge on}} a movement-restored Inertia before they retire. However, Libra uses his New <b>Rogues</b> to target <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> and forces them to join up with Libra by doing various things to those close to them. Even with <b>the</b> New <b>Rogues</b> slain by <b>the</b> <b>Rogues,</b> Libra doesn't give up that easily. They still turn down Libra even after Zoom is depowered by Inertia who is then killed by <b>the</b> <b>Rogues.</b>|$|R

5|$|The DEQ has {{collected}} water-quality data in <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> basin {{since the mid-1980s}} and has used it to generate scores on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The index is meant to provide an assessment of water quality for general recreational uses; OWQI scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Of the eight Rogue basin sites tested during the water years 1997–2006, five were ranked good, one was excellent, and two—Little Butte Creek and Bear Creek, in the most populated part of <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> basin—were poor. On <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River itself, scores varied from 92 at RM138.4 (RK222.7) declining to 85 at RM117.2 (RK188.6) but improving to 97 at RM11.0 (RK17.7). By comparison, the average OWQI score for the Willamette River in downtown Portland, the state's largest city, was 74 between 1986 and 1995.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Memphis <b>Rogues</b> {{won their}} first round {{series against the}} Atlanta Quicksilver. Having {{the best record in}} <b>the</b> league, <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> {{expected}} to play New Mexico Chiles in Memphis, but league commissioner Francisco Marcos moved the series to Albuquerque, New Mexico based on the higher number of spectators at Chiles games. When <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> withdrew from <b>the</b> playoffs in protest, Marcos shuffled the teams in the semifinal round. He replaced <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> with <b>the</b> El Paso Patriots which had the best record among the teams eliminated in the first round.|$|R

5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists {{found evidence that}} OR-7 and his mate had produced a second litter of pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine.|$|E
5|$|The first European Americans {{to visit}} the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden who {{traveled}} north through <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Valley on February 14, 1827. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived a few decades later. The sudden increase in population created conflicts with the Latgawa, which ultimately led to <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River Wars of 1855 and 1856. After the wars, the remaining Latgawa were forced hundreds of miles north to the Siletz Reservation on the central Oregon Coast.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} density of <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> watershed {{is only about}} 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E

50|$|Bart {{revealed}} {{himself as}} the Flash in order to fight <b>the</b> <b>Rogues.</b> During <b>the</b> battle, {{it was revealed that}} the machine built by Inertia actually drains the Speed Force from an individual instead of freezing time. When <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> used it on the Flash, Bart's powers were stripped away from him, leaving him surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> and leading to the appearance of the Black Flash. Inertia's machine proved unstable, however, and would destroy the West Coast if the Speed Force was not safely released from it. Bart fought <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> before chasing after Inertia, distracting them while Valerie Perez released the Speed Force. In a panic, Captain Cold, Heatwave, and Weather Wizard kill Bart.|$|R
5|$|Gygax {{brought in}} Don Turnbull from Games Workshop {{to manage the}} company, then worked with Mohan and Mentzer on a science fiction-themed RPG, Cyborg Commando, which was {{published}} in 1987. However, sales of the new game were not brisk; NIPI was still dependent on Gord <b>the</b> <b>Rogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} water are {{diverted}} from Little Butte Creek for irrigation, water storage, and power generation. Canal systems deliver the water to nearby Howard Prairie Lake and the Klamath River watershed, Agate Lake, and <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Valley.|$|E
5|$|Much more ancient {{than the}} {{upstream}} mountains are the exotic terranes of the Klamath Mountains to the west. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa {{and pushed it}} westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon. The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs and bits of subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches of time before colliding with North America as a single block about 150 to 130million years ago. Much of <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River watershed, including <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of exotic terranes.|$|E
5000|$|Snart and <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> {{first made}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the DC Rebirth's storylines; they are fleetingly watching a news report about the many newly created speedsters appearing throughout the city in The Flash #3. Snart quips {{that it is time}} for <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> to leave Central City for a while. Visually <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> still seem to be based upon their New 52 appearances in this cameo, though when Snart later appears in one of Flash's memory flashbacks he has resorted to an even older look. He and <b>the</b> other <b>Rogues</b> retain these costumes in their later appearances.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2009 The Flash: Rebirth miniseries, Captain Cold is {{seen with}} <b>the</b> other <b>Rogues,</b> reading about Barry Allen's return and {{claiming}} that they would need more of <b>the</b> <b>Rogues.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rogues</b> are still debating Allen's return, with Cold saying it's time to pull out their contingency plan that Scudder came up with, stating [...] "In case The Flash returns, break glass." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{comic book}} universes {{such as the}} DCU and the Marvel Universe, a rogues gallery is a {{collection}} of recurring enemies of a particular hero. Notable examples include <b>the</b> Batman <b>rogues</b> gallery, <b>the</b> Spider-Man <b>rogues</b> gallery, <b>the</b> Superman <b>rogues</b> gallery, and <b>the</b> Flash <b>rogues</b> gallery.|$|R
5|$|Nearby {{watersheds}} include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to {{the east}}, the South Fork Rogue River {{to the east}} and north, and minor tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} along <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River {{and its tributaries}} for at least 8,500years. European explorers made first contact with Native Americans (Indians) {{toward the end of}} the 18thcentury and began beaver {{trapping}} and other activities in the region. Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the Post Office Department added mail-boat service along the lower Rogue. As of 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.|$|E

50|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, Axel Walker, known (in this reality) as the Trixter, was imprisoned in Iron Heights; the prisoners forced to shut Trixter {{up for his}} jokes. He and <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> escape from Iron Heights and he then follows Mirror Master's Rogues; however, <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> did not invite him. The Trixter claims to them {{that he plans to}} kidnap Citizen Cold's sister, Lisa Snart. The Trixter pursues revenge on Citizen Cold for murdering the original Trickster. <b>The</b> <b>Rogues,</b> however find out that the Trixter has been working for Citizen Cold all along. <b>The</b> <b>Rogues</b> member, Mirror Master kills him by making him enter his mirrorverse, causing him to die. Axel mentions that Cold has killed the previous Trickster.|$|R
5000|$|The Renegade Flight was {{eventually}} destroyed before the Battle of Hoth on an escort mission with a convoy carrying {{supplies for the}} Rebel Base. <b>The</b> <b>Rogues</b> on Hoth had now the burden to defend Echo Base although new pilots were already added to their roster, like Derek Klivian and Tycho Celchu. During the Battle of Hoth, <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> had to add many [...] "guest" [...] members into their squadron. The twelve snowspeeders of <b>the</b> <b>Rogues</b> gave <b>the</b> Rebels enough time to evacuate Echo Base and were destroyed later in the battle.|$|R

5|$|The peace did not last. Miners began {{prospecting}} {{for gold}} in the watershed, including a Bear Creek tributary called Jackson Creek, where they established a mining camp in 1851 {{at the site of}} what later became Jacksonville. Indian attacks on miners that year led to U.S. Army intervention and fighting near Table Rock between Indians and the combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias. John P. Gaines, the new territorial governor, negotiated a new treaty with some but not all of the Indian bands, removing them from Bear Creek and other tributaries {{on the south side of}} the main stem. At about the same time, more white emigrants, including women and children, were settling in the region. By 1852, about 28donation land claims had been filed in <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> Valley. Further clashes in 1853 led to the Treaty with <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River (1853) that established the Table Rock Indian Reservation across the river from the federal Fort Lane. As the white population increased and Indian losses of land, food sources, and personal safety mounted, bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854–55, culminating in <b>the</b> <b>Rogue</b> River War of 1855–56.|$|E
