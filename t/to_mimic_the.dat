5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death.|$|E
5|$|Assante and Banderas {{did their}} own singing, and studied {{to master the}} {{instruments}} their characters use in the film.

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This {{ensures that the}} inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> feeling of being hit.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} {{priority}} purchase contracts {{as a means to}} coordinate utility purchases from non-utility generators. It is shown that differentiated contracts should have the potential for attracting more diverse, NUG proposals (in terms of technical and economic characteristics). It is also argued that differentiated contracts should permit better integration and coordination of NUG capacity since they come closer <b>to</b> <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> utility's resource allocation problem. Several areas for future research are suggested. ...|$|R
5|$|While the Myrmica ant colony can {{identify}} {{each other through}} chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once the P. rebeli begin <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> sound of the queen ant, the worker ants begin to treat the P. rebeli {{as if it were}} the queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that recognizes that the P. rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color. Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E

5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled {{wobbegong}} can generally be found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance of a}} small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The tasselled wobbegong {{has been reported to}} bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, {{but has no}} sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E

Tumpeng dated back to ancient Indonesian tradition that revered mountains as the abode of hyangs, the spirit of ancestors and gods. The cone-shaped rice meant <b>to</b> <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> holy mountain. The feast served as somekind of thanks giving for the abundance of harvest or any other blessings.|$|R
5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E
5|$|The Congo serpent eagle is superficially {{similar in}} plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, {{which has an}} {{overlapping}} range with the serpent eagle. It {{has been suggested that}} the Congo serpent eagle evolved <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> Cassin's hawk-eagle, which could give the serpent eagle several advantages, possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing, lowering its own predation, and/or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds. D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi resembles the adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the shaking. Their hit times proved <b>to</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> seismic wave propagation generated by the earthquake. On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start shaking. The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|E
