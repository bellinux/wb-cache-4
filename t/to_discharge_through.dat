50|$|Another {{method of}} {{achieving}} pulsed laser operation is to pump the laser material with a source that is itself pulsed, either through electronic charging {{in the case}} of flash lamps, or another laser which is already pulsed. Pulsed pumping was historically used with dye lasers where the inverted population lifetime of a dye molecule was so short that a high energy, fast pump was needed. The way to overcome this problem was to charge up large capacitors which are then switched <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> flashlamps, producing an intense flash. Pulsed pumping is also required for three-level lasers in which the lower energy level rapidly becomes highly populated preventing further lasing until those atoms relax to the ground state. These lasers, such as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW mode.|$|E
5000|$|With {{an area of}} 6,7 {{hectares}} {{and average}} depth of 1,5 metres (maximum 2,5 metres), Kyrkosjön contains 80,000 cubic metres of water and is supplied by a drainage area of 48 hectares. The lake is thus small and shallow, with no feeder or storm water conduit connected to it. The lake is surrounded {{by one of the}} biggest broadleaf forest in Stockholm rich in various species of birds, batrachians, and bats. Levels of phosphorus and nitrogen have decreased since the 1980s. Metal levels are low and the waters are moderately clear. Two bathe are located at Kyrkosjön, which is considered to be of significant recreational and natural value. Sewers from a nearby allotment-garden and a traffic route produces some input flow, but normally not enough to even produce an outflow. [...] Historically considerably larger, Kyrksjön used to extend well into the Spånga parish and its outflow used <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> a nine metres tall white water.

5000|$|In {{a simple}} charged {{transmission}} line pulse generator (animation, right) {{a length of}} transmission line such as a coaxial cable is connected through a switch to a matched load RL at one end, and {{at the other end}} to a DC voltage source V through a resistor RS which is large compared to the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line. [...] When the power supply is connected it slowly charges up the capacitance of the line through RS. When the switch is closed, a voltage equal to V/2 is applied to the load, the charge stored in the line begins <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> the load a current of V/2Z0 [...] and a voltage step travels up the line toward the source. [...] The source end of the line is approximately an open circuit due to the high RS, so the step is reflected uninverted and travels back down the line toward the load. The result is that a pulse of voltage is applied to the load with a duration equal to 2D/c where D is the length of the line and c is the propagation velocity of the pulse in the line. [...] The propagation velocity in typical transmission lines is within 50% of the speed of light. For example, in most types of coaxial cable the propagation velocity is approximately 2/3 the speed of light, or 20 cm per nanosecond.|$|E

The accelerator is a means for accelerating the aerosols toward {{the face of the}} capacitor sensor with such force that they partially penetrate the capacitor sensor, momentarily discharging it. The readout device is a means for counting the number of discharges of the capacitor sensor and measuring the amplitudes of these different discharges. The aerosols are accelerated by the accelerator {{in the direction of the}} metal layer with such force that they penetrate the metal and damage the oxide layers, thereby allowing the electrical charge on the capacitor <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> the damaged region. Each incident aerosol initiates a discharge path through the capacitor in such a fashion as to vaporize the conducting path. Once the discharge action is complete, the low resistance path no longer exists between the two capacitor plates and the capacitor is again able to accept a charge.

40|$|A short {{document}} proposes liquid-metal-fed pulsed plasma thrusters {{for small}} spacecraft. The propellant liquid {{for such a}} thruster would be a low-melting-temperature metal that would be stored molten in an unpressurized, heated reservoir and would be pumped to the thruster by a magnetohydrodynamic coupler. The liquid would enter the thruster via a metal tube inside an electrically insulating ceramic tube. A capacitor would be connected between the outlet of the metal tube and the outer electrode of the thruster. The pumping would cause a drop of liquid to form at the outlet, eventually growing large enough {{to make contact with}} the outer electrode. Contact would close the circuit through the capacitor, causing the capacitor <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> the drop. The capacitor would have been charged with enough energy that the discharge would vaporize, ionize, and electromagnetically accelerate the contents of the metal drop. The resulting plasma would be ejected at a speed of about 50 km/s. The vaporization of the drop would reopen the circuit through the capacitor, enabling recharging of the capacitor. As pumping continued, a new drop would grow and the process would repeat...|$|E
40|$|In Part I, {{some of the}} {{important}} physical ideas {{that have been used}} in an analysis of chemical changes in rocket nozzles are reviewed with particular reference to the three-body recombination reaction. Modified forma of the simple near-equilibrium flow criterion developed about 15 years ago are shown to lead to results that are substantially equivalent to estimates derived from a criterion of Bray. The influence of surface-catalyzed processes on atomic recombination rates in rocket nozzles is considered and found likely to be important in present solid-propellant rocket engines. In Part II, studies of the effective desorption rates of gases (Ar, He, and CO_ 2) from sand and from silica gel are described. These rates have been determined experimentally by measuring, as a function of time, the pressure drop in a vessel containing the solids when the gases are allowed <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> a small de Laval nozzle. The dependence of the desorption rate on temperature has been investigated. A theoretical expression for the rate of desorption from porous solids has been developed assuming that the overall process is diffusion controlled.

40|$|Understanding of the {{mechanisms}} that affect flow and {{pressure drop in}} porous ceramic diesel particulate filters {{is important in the}} design optimization of this class of diesel exhaust after-treatment systems. Furthermore, determination of the parameters involved in the calculation of pressure drop as a function of collected soot mass is important for successful filter loading and regeneration modelling. This paper presents the results of an experimental analysis of pressure drop {{as a function of the}} geometric and operating parameters of cordierite and SiC diesel filters. Single-cell filters from cordierite and silicon carbide were prepared to single out any effects from the complex flow processes that take place in a full-sized filter. The product of soot layer permeability and density was experimentally determined by employing a specially designed experimental apparatus. The calculation was supported by a simple computer calculation that is also presented in this paper. The distribution of soot loading inside the channels of a full-sized filter, in various loaded and partially regenerated conditions, was assessed by connecting the apparatus <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> selected channels of the filter.

40|$|A {{non-linear}} observer {{model of}} a semi-autogenous grinding mill is developed. The observer model distinguishes between the volumetric hold-up of water, solids, and the grinding media in the mill. Solids refer to all ore small enough <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> the end-discharge grate, and grinding media refers to the rocks and steel balls. The rocks are all ore too large to discharge from the mill. The observer model uses the accumulation rate of solids and the mill’s discharge rate as parameters. It is shown that with mill discharge flow-rate, discharge density, and volumetric hold-up measurements, the model states and parameters are linearly observable. Although instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet included in industrial circuits because of space restrictions, this study motivates the benefits {{to be gained from}} including such instrumentation. An extended Kalman filter is applied in simulation to estimate the model states and parameters from data generated by a semi-autogenous mill simulation model from literature. Results indicate that if sufficiently accurate measurements are available, especially at the discharge of the mill, it is possible to reliably estimate grinding media, solids and water hold-ups within the mill. Such an observer can be used as part of an advanced process control strategy.

40|$|I ce {{mass loss}} from the Greenland Ice Sheet {{is a primary}} {{contributor}} to global sea level rise. The rate of ice loss has accelerated {{over the last couple}} of decades and Greenland currently contributes about 0. 7 - 1. 1 mm/yr to sea-level rise (260 - 380 Gt/ice per year; Enderlin et al. 2014; Shepherd et al. 2012). Predicting the potential rate and limits of future mass loss requires a clear understanding of ice sheet dynamics and how the ice sheet is coupled to the climate system. Roughly a third to a half of Greenland ice loss is due <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>through</b> iceberg calving at the ice-ocean interface, as opposed to in situ surface melt (Enderlin et al. 2014; Shepherd et al. 2012). Glacier velocity, as well as ice thickness, terminus advance and retreat, and the mechanisms controlling their variability, must be understood to calculate and predict ice sheet discharge. Characterization and understanding of ice sheet velocity contributes both to exploring the processes controlling ice dynamics and to constraining ice sheet models used to predict future mass loss and associated sea-level rise. Modern satellite technology and analysis techniques now allow for a more comprehensive understanding of ice flow variability across the entire Greenland Ice Sheet, including year-to-year velocity changes. To take advantage of the lengthening satellite data record, an ice-sheet-wide survey of interannual velocity changes on Greenland outlet glaciers (glacier terminus width> 1. 5 km) was completed for 2000 through 2010 (Moon et al. 2012). The study examined winter velocities for 2000 / 01 and every year from 2005 / 06 through 2010 / 11 (subsequently referred to by the earlier year, so 2010 / 11 = 2010). Prior to this study, outlet glacier velocities had only been examined for smaller groups of glaciers or by comparing broad velocity snapshots with ~ 5 -year sampling. The study revealed notable regional and local variability underlying mean speedup across much of the ice sheet. IN THIS ISSUE Greenland outlet glacier ice-flow variabilit...|$|E
