25|$|Tamas Wells {{began playing}} the piano when he was aged about eight years, but disliked sitting for the examinations. He grew up {{listening}} to the music of the Beatles – for most of his teenage years the only album he owned was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) – <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> his music is not consciously influenced by them. After finishing school and moving to Melbourne, Australia, for his university education, he had a group of friends who played the guitar and wrote their own music. He also listened to Australian indie bands such as Art of Fighting and The Lucksmiths.|$|E

500|$|Radcliffe first {{expressed}} a desire to act at the age of five, and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it was people just trying to [...] "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" [...] rather than jealousy.|$|E
500|$|While {{some conservatives}} have {{condemned}} {{the show for}} its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold center-right political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock liberal viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons. Political commentator Andrew Sullivan dubbed the group South Park Republicans, or South Park conservatives. Sullivan averred {{that members of the}} group are [...] "extremely skeptical of political correctness but also are socially liberal on many issues", <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> the phrase applied to them is meant {{to be more of a}} casual indication of beliefs than a strong partisan label. Brian C. Anderson describes the group as [...] "generally characterized by holding strong libertarian beliefs and rejecting more conservative social policy", and notes that although the show makes [...] "wicked fun of conservatives", it is [...] "at the forefront of a conservative revolt against liberal media." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams {{prefers to}} work from a plot rather than from a full script, a result of Ann Nocenti's dense Longshot scripts, though he has worked from a full script, as with his work on Three Dimensional Alien Worlds for Pacific Comics and The Authority. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he prefers group books because they more easily allow him to hide his [...] "bad layout skills", he is {{nonetheless}} comfortable with solo character books. He begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the story he is given, either {{at home or in}} a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2inches x 3inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto illustration board with a non-photo blue pencil, sometimes using a Prismacolor light blue pencil, because it is not too waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his living room couch. After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light blue pencil, and finalize the details with a Number 2 pencil. He drew the first three chapters of [...] "Jonni Future" [...] at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, [...] "The Garden of the Sklin", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. He will use photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 October 2010, {{the company}} Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited {{announced}} that Chris Hutcheson {{had left his}} position as CEO of Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd.

His father-in-law's [...] "away days," [...] wrote Ramsay, [...] "were rarely what I thought they were." [...] Company accounts show Hutcheson borrowed up to £1.5million from Gordon Ramsay Holdings, of which he was chief executive, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he reported the borrowings to the company and paid the money back. Hutcheson said he had been [...] "vaporised" [...] and subjected to a [...] "public hanging" [...] by Ramsay, whom he described as a friendless egotist. In April 2017 Hutcheson pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to hack into the computers of Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited.|$|E
2500|$|Many observant Jews follow {{opinions}} {{by religious}} authorities {{who do not}} see beards as an absolute religious requirement, {{and at least one}} Orthodox rabbi, Shmuel Felzenberg, from the community known as Chabad—a group for whom beards are normally considered required—made the decision to shave (a very difficult decision for him, he admits) in order to serve as a military chaplain after discussing the matter with the rabbi he considers his teacher and mentor. Even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that shaving—even with the approval of his teacher—"was ultimately a strong, bitter pill to swallow", he does it in order to be [...] "afforded the opportunity to serve." [...] However, he says he uses an electric razor, the approach to shaving that is least objectionable in terms of Jewish law (rather than a razor, which all rabbinic authorities agree is prohibited based on traditional Jewish law), and [...] "from the moment" [...] he goes on leave to [...] "the moment" [...] he must return to duty, he does not shave.|$|E
