25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, <b>tappets</b> and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a throttle body injector system with a tuned intake manifold and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} throttle body injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller <b>tappets.</b>|$|E
25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded <b>tappets,</b> a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth drive chain. It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|E

50|$|A much-improved system {{placed the}} shims above the <b>tappet.</b> This allowed each shim {{to be changed}} without {{removing}} either the <b>tappet</b> or camshaft, usually by pressing the <b>tappet</b> and valve down against the valve spring with a lever tool and removing the shim with tweezers. A difficulty with this system is that the rubbing surface of the <b>tappet</b> becomes {{the surface of the}} shim, which is a difficult problem of mass-production metallurgy. The first mass production engine to use this system was the Fiat twin-cam engine of the early 1960s, followed by engines from Volvo and the water-cooled Volkswagens.|$|R

40|$|Thi present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for reducing the gap width between two or more workpieces {{in order to facilitate}} the welding of workpieces.

The invention also relates to a device with which the process can be performed. The device comprises facilities for positioning and holding the workpieces to be joined and is characterized by the fact that a <b>tappet</b> is provided for transmitting the impulses, said <b>tappet</b> having a preferably rotational-symmetrical shape, and said <b>tappet</b> is moved by a drive unit in the axial direction towards the workpiece facing the <b>tappet...</b>|$|R

60|$|The Swanzy {{establishment}} {{has set up}} {{an exceptionally}} light battery of twelve stamps, made in sections for easier transport. Neither here nor {{in any of the}} mines have stone-breakers or automatic feeders yet been introduced: the stuff is all hand-spalled. One small 'Belleville' drives the stamps, another works the Tangye pump, and a third turns the saw-mills. I will notice a few differences between the Swanzy system and that of Effuenta. The wooden framework of the stamp-mill is better than iron. The cam-shaft here carries only single, not double cams, a decided disadvantage: in order to strike the same number of blows per minute it has to make double the number of revolutions. Moreover, by some unhappy mistake, it is too far from its work, and the result is a succession of sharp blows on the <b>tappets,</b> with injury to all the gear. On the other hand proper fingers are fitted to the stamps: this is far better than supporting them by a rough chock of wood. At Crockerville, as at Effuenta, only six of the twelve stamps were working: there the pump was at fault; here the blanket-tables had not been made wide enough. I could hardly estimate the total amount of ore brought to grass, or its average yield: specimens of white quartz, with threads, strings, and lobs of gold, have been sent to England from Crocker's Reef. The best tailings are reserved either for treatment on the spot or for reduction in England. The mine, as regards present condition, is in the stage of prospecting upon a large and liberal scale. The stamps are chiefly used to run through samples of from 50 to 100 tons taken from the various parts of the property: in this way the most exact results can be obtained. During my visit they were preparing to work a hundred tons from Aji Bipa, the fourth and furthest butte to the north-west.|$|E
50|$|They have a DOHC {{valvetrain}} configuration with hydraulic <b>tappets,</b> driving four valves per cylinder. Exceptions are the 1.4 12V unit, {{also with}} hydraulic <b>tappets</b> but a SOHC valvetrain, driving three valves per cylinder, and the 1.9 8V and 2.4 10V turbodiesels, with a SOHC valvetrain with mechanical <b>tappets,</b> driving two valves per cylinder. Some versions have {{variable valve timing}} (VVT). The camshafts are toothed belt-driven.

50|$|Some mass-market {{car engines}} from the 1960s {{replaced}} the rocker-end adjustment screw with a non-adjustable rocker pivoted on a central stud with a hemispherical nut. <b>Tappet</b> adjustment {{was made by}} moving the pivot nut up and down. Some of these designs also required the <b>tappet</b> clearance to be set with the engine running. As this rapidly wore out feeler gauges, long rolls of disposable feeler strip were needed instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{stroke of}} each piston {{is caused by}} an {{eccentric}} drive shaft or an external eccentric <b>tappet</b> (e.g., stroke ring).|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic <b>tappets</b> are <b>tappets</b> {{that contain}} a small {{hydraulic}} piston, pressurised by the engine's lubricating oil supply. Although the piston {{does not move}} appreciably or frequently, it acts as a hydraulic spring that automatically adjusts the tappet clearance according to the oil pressure. This makes the valve actuation self-adjusting {{and there is no}} need to adjust the rockers. Hydraulic <b>tappets</b> depend on a supply of clean oil at the appropriate pressure. When starting a cold engine, with low oil pressure, hydraulic <b>tappets</b> are often noisy for a few seconds, until they position themselves correctly.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic <b>tappets</b> {{require more}} complex and more {{expensive}} cylinder head design. A number of subcompact car manufacturers prefer solid valve lifters due to lower design and production cost rather than hydraulic <b>tappets.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early <b>tappets</b> had rollers {{to reduce}} wear from the {{rotating}} camshaft, {{but it was}} found that the roller pivots wore even faster and also that the small radius of the rollers also tended to accelerate wear on the expensive camshaft. <b>Tappets</b> then developed plain flat ends, although these were slightly radiused as 'mushroom' <b>tappets</b> as a perfectly flat end led to 'slamming' against a steep camshaft face.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Toyota and Volkswagen Group also used a {{directly}} actuated, SOHC parallel valve configuration with two valves for each cylinder. The Toyota system used hydraulic <b>tappets.</b> The Volkswagen system used bucket <b>tappets</b> with shims for valve clearance adjustment.|$|E
50|$|Sidevalve engines also {{required}} their <b>tappets</b> adjusting, {{and in this}} case it was the <b>tappets</b> themselves that were adjusted directly. Small access plates were provided {{on the sides of the}} cylinder block, giving access to the gap between the valves and <b>tappets.</b> Some <b>tappets</b> had a threaded adjuster, but simpler engines could be adjusted by grinding down the ends of the valve stem directly. As the adjustment gap need only be expanded over the engine's working life (re-grinding valves into their valve seats during de-coking makes them sit lower, thus closing up the tappet gap), adjustment by removing metal was acceptable. Care was obviously needed, to not remove too much. Eventually the valves would be replaced entirely, a relatively common operation for engines of this era.|$|E
5000|$|Hattersley Domestic LoomThe Hattersley Domestic Loom {{was part}} of the Hattersley Domestic System that include other {{machines}} such as pirn winder and warping mill.

50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has <b>tappet</b> noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} valve setup (when setting valve clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large <b>tappet</b> clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, the <b>tappet,</b> also {{termed a}} cam follower, or lifter, {{is that part}} that runs on the {{camshaft}} and is made to move vertically {{by the action of}} the rotating cam. In an overhead valve engine, this <b>tappet</b> is fitted low down in the engine block. From there it drives a long thin pushrod, {{up to the top of}} the engine, above the cylinder head. Here the rockers, arranged on a rocker shaft beneath the rocker cover, reverse the direction of the valve movement to press the valves downwards to open them.|$|R
