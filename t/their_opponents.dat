5|$|As {{they had}} in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used {{strategic}} methods against <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, but did not deprive <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> of water since Ali did not want to follow the footsteps of the Meccan army; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug a trench to render the enemy cavalry ineffective.|$|E
5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} dealing with <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> {{that made them}} very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> in the final, Somerset {{joined the}} tournament {{in the second}} round, facing Derbyshire. Bowling first, Somerset limited <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> to 224; Joel Garner was their most {{economical}} bowler. In reply, Somerset captain and opening batsman Brian Rose remained not out on 88 when his side reached their winning target with 3.5 overs remaining, having lost two wickets. Kent travelled to Taunton for the quarter-final, in which Somerset chose to bat first after winning the toss. Only Graham Burgess reached a half-century for Somerset against a bowling attack which included five Test players. In Kent's reply, Garner claimed five wickets and Ian Botham three as Somerset bowled <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> out for 60 runs. Against Middlesex in the semi-final, Somerset's bowlers were once again led by Garner, who picked up four wickets as the London-based club were dismissed for 185. Somerset won with 9.4 overs remaining {{for the loss of}} three wickets and Peter Denning remained unbeaten on 90.|$|E
25|$|In a two-player game of cribbage, {{a player}} scores one match point for winning a game. <b>Their</b> <b>opponent</b> will start as dealer {{in the next}} game. If a player skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> scores 91 points), that player wins two match points for that game. If a player double skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 61), they score three or four match points for the game, {{depending}} on local convention. If a player triple skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 31 points), they automatically win the match. Double and triple skunks {{are not included in}} the official rules of cribbage play and are optional. There are several different formats for scoring match points.|$|R
50|$|The {{player that}} captures all of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces wins. Alternatively, the player that fully {{occupies}} <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> triangular board wins. Another way to win, is {{if a player}} can trap <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces and thus preventing them from performing a legal move.|$|R
50|$|In a two player game of cribbage {{a player}} scores one match point for each game won. <b>Their</b> <b>opponent</b> will begin {{the next game}} as first dealer. If a player skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> scores 91 points) then that player scores one extra match point for that game (two match points in total). If a player double skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 61), then they score two extra match points for the game (four match points in total). If a player triple skunks <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> (reaches 121 points before <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> reaches 31 points), they {{automatically}} win the match regardless of how many match points are needed to win. Double and triple skunks {{are not included in}} the official rules of cribbage play and are optional. There are several different formats for scoring match points.|$|R
5|$|The Ottomans {{were able}} to build on their {{military}} success due to the numerous divisions amongst <b>their</b> <b>opponents.</b> Many of the peasant classes in Anatolia saw the Ottomans as the better master.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ælle {{and three}} of his sons {{are said to have}} landed at a place called Cymensora and fought against the local Britons.

A player wins the board by {{selecting}} the eighth and final correct answer. If one player finds the fourth wrong answer, <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> automatically wins the board.|$|R
5000|$|A player wins {{if he or}} she captures all of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces, or stalemates <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{pieces by}} not {{allowing}} them to move on their turn.|$|R

5|$|Halifax rallied in Game 2, {{winning a}} road {{game at the}} WFCU Centre in Windsor. The Rainmen {{committed}} 37 personal fouls in the entire game, but <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> allowed them to attempt 44 free throws despite committing only 31.|$|E
5|$|I am {{not quite}} {{certain that the}} present {{regulations}} governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> hail from.|$|E
50|$|Pole Me Over: Players have {{to grab a}} pole, {{and push}} <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> {{backwards}} toward <b>their</b> own barrels. The first player to knock over <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> barrels twice wins.|$|R

5|$|In a {{match for}} the WWF Tag Team Championship, The Smoking Gunns defended their title. <b>Their</b> <b>opponents</b> were Owen Hart and a mystery partner. Hart refused to tell anyone {{the name of his}} partner, which left the Gunns {{uncertain}} who they would be facing and led to much speculation about the identity of the mystery partner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy. James I and Charles I both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and Magna Carta was cited extensively by <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> to challenge the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{brothers}} competed as teenagers in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as jobbers – wrestlers who consistently lose to make <b>their</b> <b>opponents</b> look stronger – both in singles and tag team competition.

The wrestler lifts <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> up and turns them upside down {{so that they are}} held up by the wrestler's arm cradling their back. The wrestler then throws the opponent to the ground so that they land on <b>their</b> back. The <b>opponent</b> will often assist the slammer by placing their arm on the slammer's thigh.|$|R

Atherton LR won the replayed tie and finished third ahead of Nelson.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the {{new breed}} of ships was not their only crucial advantage. Dreadnought used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her a top speed of 21 knots, against the 18 knots typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver <b>their</b> <b>opponents,</b> the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.|$|E

5000|$|A player wins {{if he or}} she reduces <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{pieces to}} one, or stalemates <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces by not {{allowing}} them to move on <b>their</b> turn. An <b>opponent</b> with only one piece left is not a threat as it can no longer perform a custodian capture or initiate a stalemate.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} for a player to either get one of their cubes to the far corner square in the grid (where <b>their</b> <b>opponent</b> started) or to remove all of <b>their</b> <b>opponent's</b> cubes from the board.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team.
