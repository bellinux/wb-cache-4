40|$|Oxadiazole as a {{class of}} five-membered heterocycles has been {{reported}} to be biologically versatile compounds due to their metabolic profile. Amongst these heterocycles, 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole has become an important construction motif for the development of new drugs, furamizole 1 as antibiotics, <b>tiodazosin</b> 2 as antihypertensive agent and raltegravir 3 as anti-retroviral agent have been on market. In addition, 2, 5 -disub-stituted- 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole derivatives have also been used as electron conducting and hole blocking (ECHB) materials for electron deficient and good electron transport properties of oxadiazole rings. 4 The most common synthetic approach to 1, 3, 4 -oxadia-zoles involves cyclodehydration of 1, 2 -diacylhydrazines 3 (Scheme 1). Typically, this reaction is carried out by using SOCl 2...|$|E
