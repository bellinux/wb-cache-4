5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. <b>Turning</b> <b>off</b> his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was able to fly to it and land safely.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> the heat source.|$|E

5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso {{interrupted}} the promo, with RVD stating {{it had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE deserved no credit, that the interview was a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights <b>turning</b> <b>off,</b> and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for BÃ©la IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> toward Split.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a game to include stealth gameplay, the {{knowledge}} of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world. The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies' reactions to the effects of the player's actions, such as <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> the lights, as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI's movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries. Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player. Examples of hybrid stealth/horror games include , Outlast, and the Penumbra video game series.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Bernard uses Dr. Fred's family {{fortune of}} {{royalties}} from the Maniac Mansion TV series {{to purchase a}} real diamond, both Laverne and Hoagie manage to power their Chron-o-Johns, and the three are reunited in the present. Purple Tentacle arrives, hijacks a Chron-o-John and takes it to the previous day {{to prevent them from}} <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> the sludge machine; he is pursued by Green Tentacle in another pod.Laverne: Uh-oh!Green Tentacle: Don't worry guys! This time I know I can stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E
50|$|During <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{the forward}} voltage {{of the device}} must be limited until the current tails off. The limit is usually around 20% of the forward {{blocking}} voltage rating. If the voltage rises too fast at <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{not all of the}} device will <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> and the GTO will fail, often explosively, due to the high voltage and current focused on {{a small portion of the}} device. Substantial snubber circuits are added around the device to limit the rise of voltage at <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b> Reseting the snubber circuit usually places a minimum on time requirement on GTO based circuits.|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} study compared {{the prevalence of}} multiple types of condom-associated âturn offsâ in men and women. Nearly 2000 people completed a web-based questionnaire. Data were analysed from 464 {{men and women who}} reported that condoms had <b>turned</b> them <b>off</b> the last time they were used. Gender differences were not observed for the majority (9) of 15 <b>turn</b> <b>offs.</b> The most common <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> related to loss of pleasure. For example, more than three-quarters of the men and nearly 40 % of the women reported decreased sexual sensation (P = 0. 0001). Putting on condoms was reported by 43. 2 % of the men versus 30. 2 % of the women (P = 0. 02). Smell was a relatively frequent <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> with about one-third indicating this issue and no significant gender difference (P = 0. 32). <b>Turn</b> <b>offs</b> pertaining to arousal and orgasm were also common. Findings suggest that numerous physical and psychological condom <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> may be experienced by men and women while using male condoms. Although some <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> differed as a function of gender, there was remarkable similarity between men and wome...|$|R

5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
