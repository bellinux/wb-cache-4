5|$|He {{was born}} in Sandymount, Ireland and educated there and in London. He spent {{childhood}} holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry {{from an early age}} when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. <b>These</b> <b>topics</b> feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display Yeats's debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed <b>these</b> <b>topics</b> from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about <b>these</b> <b>topics.</b>|$|E

We formalise the semantics of this system, and give an axiomatisation which we show is sound and complete. We then show that we can easily compute the closure of a set of all topics in this model, which is the set of topics which are required by that set. This closure is computed in an identical manner to that for other formalisations of topic dependencies, showing that for this purpose no distinction need be drawn. We then consider a different kind of closure, where given a set of desired topics, we must find a subset such that the total running time of all topics in its closure is less than [...] ...|$|R
