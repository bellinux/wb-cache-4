5|$|The {{traditional}} Cornish pasty, which since 2011 has Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) {{status in}} Europe, {{is filled with}} beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow <b>turnip</b> or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as <b>turnip)</b> and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and is baked. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It {{is regarded as the}} national dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made and some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the name is not clear. One {{interpretation}} is from the story How Rübezahl Got his Name, by Johann Karl August Musäus, which recounts how Rübezahl abducted a princess who liked <b>turnips</b> (Rübe). The princess gets very lonely there in the mountains. To keep her company, Rübezahl turns the <b>turnips</b> into her friends and acquaintances. As the <b>turnips</b> wilt after a little while, so do the persons that were created by Rübezahl's magic. The princess asks him to count (zählen) the <b>turnips</b> in the field. While he counted, she escaped.|$|R
50|$|Planting {{cover crops}} such as <b>turnips</b> and clover was not {{permitted}} under the common field system because they interfered {{with access to the}} fields. Besides, other people's livestock could graze the <b>turnips.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the <b>Turnip</b> Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E

50|$|In most of England, {{the smaller}} white {{vegetables}} are called <b>turnips,</b> while the larger yellow ones {{are referred to}} as swedes. In the USA, <b>turnips</b> are the same, but swedes are usually called rutabagas. In Scotland, Ireland, parts of northern England, and parts of Canada, the usage varies and is sometimes confusingly reversed, with the yellow vegetables being called <b>turnips</b> or neeps, and the white ones swedes. Neeps are mashed and eaten with haggis, traditionally on Burns Night.|$|R
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant <b>turnip</b> sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
5|$|Cracker Barrel {{was founded}} in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales {{representative}} for Shell Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen {{to give it a}} Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country ham, and <b>turnip</b> greens.|$|E
5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The <b>turnip</b> is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|However, in some dialects of British English the two {{vegetables}} have overlapping or reversed names. In {{the north}} of England and Scotland, the larger, yellow rutabagas are called neeps or swede from folk etymology, while the smaller white <b>turnips</b> are called <b>turnips.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Gunn {{family home}} in Thurso was a farm, and the young Bryan would often pester the farmhands to play {{football}} with him. They would use a <b>turnip</b> if no ball was available. By the age of four he was keen on goalkeeping; he was fearless of injury and enjoyed diving on the ball. When Bryan was four-and-a-half, {{the family moved to}} Invergordon, 20 miles from Inverness. He attended Park Primary School in the town and joined the school football team. Future professional Bobby Geddes was favoured over him as first-choice goalkeeper for the team; Gunn played as an outfield player until Geddes moved on to secondary school.|$|E
5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, <b>turnip</b> and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of <b>turnip,</b> white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and <b>turnip</b> are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} series, S.Baldrick has lost almost all {{intelligence}} and apparently has {{no desire to}} rise in social standing and claims in the first episode that his goal in life is the acquisition of turnips.

He also haggles for a priceless <b>turnip</b> (£400,000). Baldrick's <b>turnip</b> is crushed by Blackadder later and presumably his titles were erased as in the following episodes, he is once more lower class.|$|E
5000|$|People {{living in}} the British Isles have long carved <b>turnips</b> and often used them as {{lanterns}} to ward off harmful spirits. In the Middle Ages, rowdy bands of children roamed the streets in hideous masks carrying carved <b>turnips</b> known in Scotland as [...] "tumshie heads". In modern times, <b>turnips</b> are often carved to look as sinister and threatening as possible, and are put in the window or on the doorstep of a house at Halloween to ward off evil spirits. Since pumpkins became readily available in Europe in the 1980s, they have taken over this role for the most part.|$|R
