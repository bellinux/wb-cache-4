5|$|Because of {{the club}} colours, sky blue and white, the club is often known by the nicknames Di blåe (Scanian: The Blues) and Himmelsblått (The Sky Blues). The home kit is sky-blue shirts, white shorts, and sky-blue socks. The away strip is black. Various {{alternative}} kits {{have been used for}} European play such as an all-white kit introduced in the 1950s, and re-used for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, and all-black kits with sky-blue and golden <b>trimmings</b> were used for the European campaigns in 2005 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Pflueger renovated the Nasser brother's New Mission Theater, {{bringing}} Art Deco stylings to {{the lobby}} {{in contrast to the}} Spanish Mission <b>trimmings</b> in the main auditorium. In 1993, the theater closed. The theater, now designated San Francisco Landmark No. 245, was purchased by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas and completely renovated to its original splendor, opening its doors once again to patrons in December 2015. Pflueger simultaneously worked on the remodeling of the Nasser's New Fillmore Theater, a sister design similar in many respects. The New Fillmore closed in 1957 and was demolished to make way for an urban redevelopment project.|$|E
5|$|SS V-Series Special Edition: {{following}} the 2009 cancellation of Pontiac brand in North America, the Pontiac G8 front-end fascia and other <b>trimmings</b> were fitted to approximately 1,500 Commodore SS Vs. Unveiled at the 2009 Deniliquin ute muster on 2 October, sales began in November. Unlike the G8 {{which was only}} offered as a sedan, Holden issued utility, sedan and Sportwagon body variants of the Special Edition. Due to {{the popularity of the}} Pontiac-inspired SS V, Holden announced on 14 January 2010 that production would be extended until March 2010.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making <b>trimmings,</b> such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|The Jags {{flirted with}} a number of colour schemes in their early years. From their {{inception}} until 1900 the kits were predominantly blue with red and white <b>trimmings.</b> There was then a brief period in which the players wore an orange and black striped top with white shorts and black socks. This was replaced in 1905 by a colour scheme close to that used by Aston Villa, before the club reverted to the predominantly blue kits in 1909. In season 1936–37 they changed to, and settled upon, the red-yellow-and-black attire for which they are best known, this change having been triggered initially by the club borrowing kits from the local rugby union team, West of Scotland Football Club.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for <b>trimmings,</b> scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the <b>trimmings</b> of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white <b>trimmings,</b> and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Examples include wood, sawdust, grass <b>trimmings,</b> {{domestic}} refuse, charcoal, agricultural waste, nonfood energy crops, {{and dried}} manure.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Bündchen and Brady dished out {{turkey and}} all the <b>trimmings</b> unannounced to over 400 job {{trainees}} in Roxbury Massachusetts for Goodwill Industries International.|$|E
25|$|Lubricating {{the frame}} {{components}} (axle bearings, horn blocks and bogie pivots) depends on capillary action: <b>trimmings</b> of worsted yarn are trailed from oil reservoirs into pipes {{leading to the}} respective component. The rate of oil supplied {{is controlled by the}} size of the bundle of yarn and not the speed of the locomotive, so it is necessary to remove the <b>trimmings</b> (which are mounted on wire) when stationary. However, at regular stops (such as a terminating station platform), oil finding its way onto the track can still be a problem.|$|E
25|$|The team wears navy-blue shorts in home games, {{and white}} shorts in away games. Since 2013, Carlton's clash {{guernsey}} has been predominantly white, with navy blue monogram, numbers and some <b>trimmings.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War the figure, easily {{recognizable}} {{from the}} air, was covered over with turf and hedge <b>trimmings</b> so that Luftwaffe pilots could {{not use it}} for navigation during bombing raids.|$|E
25|$|Background <b>trimmings</b> {{have been}} denied by the US Army Institute of Heraldry to other units with a parenthetical {{designation}} of “Air Assault” such as the California Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
25|$|The Model D {{touring car}} and the little six touring car were painted in {{regulation}} color, a Franklin blue with black body <b>trimmings.</b> The little six, Model M Victoria phaeton, which was a two-passenger runabout, had a Brewster green body with black running gear.|$|E
25|$|The basic stone {{used for}} the Cathedral is a sandy yellow with <b>trimmings,</b> while around the apse window a red stone is used. The green stone used in the drum of the cupola is from the 17th century. The curved blind arcading {{throughout}} is unaltered from the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Inside, a new flat {{instrument}} panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100mph compared to 120mph {{in previous years}} and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior <b>trimmings</b> received only minor revisions.|$|E
25|$|The commissioners {{and other}} senior-ranked {{officers}} of the Metropolitan Police Service and the City of London Police wear a full dress ceremonial uniform on State and special occasions (see External links below); this includes a high-necked tunic with silver or gold <b>trimmings</b> and is worn with a sword and a plumed hat.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a three-level red-brick structure with limestone footings and Donnybrook stone <b>trimmings.</b> There is a square tower, originally intended to be central, with castellated parapets. The interiors exhibit fine craftsmanship in joinery, with jarrah timber panelling and art nouveau leadlighting and glass. A grand staircase of jarrah connects the three levels of the building.|$|E
25|$|Charles Frederick Worth’s dresses {{were known}} for their lavish fabrics and <b>trimmings</b> and for {{incorporating}} elements from period dress. He created unique pieces for his most important clients, but also prepared a variety of designs, showcased by live models, that could then be tailored to the client's requirements in his workshop. Among his key innovations in women's fashion were {{to the line of}} garments and their length.|$|E
25|$|The tribute {{of the sea}} coast – {{from the}} {{inhabitants}} of Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, Mahallata, Kaiza, Amurru and Arvad which is an Island in the sea, consisting of gold, silver, tin, copper, copper-containers, linen garments with multi-coloured <b>trimmings,</b> large and small monkeys, ebony, boxwood, ivory from walrus tusk, {{a product of the}} sea – this their tribute I received and they embraced my feet.|$|E
25|$|Brussels trams {{have known}} several liveries. In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, those operated by the Tramways Bruxellois were dark green, and those by the Chemins de Fer Economiques were chocolate. The two companies merged in the 1920s, whereupon a standard livery of primrose yellow was adopted which lasted (with some minor changes in the <b>trimmings)</b> until the mid-1990s when a brighter shade of yellow was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Green fodders {{are used}} widely for {{intensive}} milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or <b>trimmings</b> of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% {{of the standard}} feed mixture.|$|E
25|$|If at eighty you’re not {{a cripple}} or an invalid, {{if you have}} your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the <b>trimmings),</b> if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, {{mountains}} and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.|$|E
25|$|Fashion Bonnets {{for outdoor}} wear had small brims that {{revealed}} the face. Earlier bonnets {{of the decade}} had lower brims. However, by mid-century Spoon Bonnets, which featured increasingly high brims and more elaborate <b>trimmings,</b> became the vogue. Bonnets were made specifically to accessorize a dress. Other less common variants, such as the Marie Stuart Bonnet, with its heart-shaped brim, and the fanchon bonnet, with its very short brim and back curtain, made appearances {{in the realm of}} fashionable headwear.|$|E
25|$|By 1874, skirts {{began to}} taper {{in the front}} and were adorned with <b>trimmings,</b> while sleeves {{tightened}} around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a sharp point in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing the fullness of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath {{in order to keep the}} dress clean.|$|E
25|$|Cavalier was not {{understood}} {{at the time}} as primarily a term describing a style of dress, but a whole political and social attitude. However, in modern times the word has become more particularly associated with the court fashions of the period, which included long flowing hair in ringlets, brightly coloured clothing with elaborate <b>trimmings</b> and lace collars and cuffs, and plumed hats. This contrasted with the dress of at least the most extreme Roundhead supporters of Parliament, with their preference for shorter hair and plainer dress, although neither side conformed to the stereotypical images entirely.|$|E
25|$|White {{shorts and}} black socks are usually worn {{as part of}} the home strip. Milan's away strip has always been {{completely}} white. It is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, {{due to the fact that}} Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red <b>trimmings</b> in recent seasons.|$|E
25|$|The open {{sandwiches}} on rye bread, {{known as}} smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, {{can be considered}} a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals traditionally consist of ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls of veal and pork) and hakkebøf (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) and kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and <b>trimmings.</b> Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters.|$|E
25|$|Both {{base and}} Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the {{standard}} 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior <b>trimmings</b> with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.|$|E
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other <b>trimmings,</b> which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very {{much a matter of}} the region and the cook's taste.|$|E
25|$|The more settled {{land-based}} West Coast Bajau are expert equestrians – {{which makes}} them remarkable in Malaysia, where horse riding has never been widespread anywhere else. The traditional costume of Sama-Bajau horsemen consists of a black or white long-sleeved shirt (badu sampit) with gold buttons (betawi) {{on the front and}} decorated with silver floral designs (intiras), black or white trousers (seluar sampit) with gold lace <b>trimmings,</b> and a headpiece (podong). They carry a spear (bujak), a riding crop (pasut), and a silver-hilted keris dagger. The horse is also caparisoned with a colourful outfit called kain kuda that also have brass bells (seriau) attached. The saddle (sila sila) is made from water buffalo hide, and padded with cloth (lapik) underneath.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Hearts football strip was {{all white}} shirts and trousers with maroon <b>trimmings,</b> and a heart sewn onto the chest. For one season they played in red, {{white and blue}} stripes. These were the colours of a club called St. Andrew, who had taken their name and colours from the University of St Andrews, that Hearts had absorbed. Since then the predominant club colours have been maroon and white. The strip typically has a maroon top and a white collar, although the strip was predominantly white in the 2010–11 season. The shorts are normally white, although maroon {{was used in the}} 2008–09 season. The socks are normally maroon with some white detail.|$|E
25|$|The Holyoke Building (or Holyoke Block) is a {{historic}} building located in downtown Seattle, Washington. It is a substantial five story brick structure with stone <b>trimmings.</b> Construction began {{at the corner of}} First Avenue and Spring Streets just before the Great Seattle fire of 1889. Completed in early 1890, it was the first permanent building completed and ready for occupancy in downtown Seattle following the fire. Today the Holyoke Building is {{one of the very few}} such buildings still standing in Seattle outside of the Pioneer Square district and is {{a historic}} remnant of the northward expansion of Seattle's business district between the time of the great fire and the Yukon Gold Rush in 1897.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} steel highway of the 125th Street viaduct, {{called the}} Riverside Drive Viaduct, between Tiemann Place and 135th Street and rising over Twelfth Avenue, is shouldered by masonry approaches. The viaduct proper {{was made of}} open hearth medium steel, comprising twenty-six spans, or bays, whose hypnotic repetition is much appreciated from underneath at street level. The south and north approaches are of rock-faced Mohawk Valley limestone with Maine granite <b>trimmings,</b> the face work being of coursed ashlar. The girders over Manhattan Street (now 125th Street) were the largest ever built at the time. The broad plaza effect of the south approach was designed to impart deliberate grandeur to the natural terminus of much of Riverside Drive's traffic {{as well as to}} give full advantage to the vista overlooking the Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades to the west.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the <b>trimmings,</b> but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E
