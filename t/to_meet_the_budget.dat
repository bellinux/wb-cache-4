50|$|In some situations, {{the private}} sector would have better means of {{efficiently}} delivering a service to the public than the public sector. As the second wave of P3 projects started in the early 2000s, the rationale evolved {{as well as a}} response to criticism from the first wave. The rationale in the second wave evolved along with the political and economic environment as well. P3s were marketed as alternative to traditional service delivery because they would have enhanced upfront project planning, contracts that provide incentives <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and timely delivery, and innovative design that add value to the public’s experience. To respond to critics of the over political and lack of expertise in negation of the public sector between P3 agreements, six of the ten provinces created of PPP agencies. These agencies would enhance The P3 process by having staff that highly trained and specialized in areas such as business management, law, and finance. The creation of PPP Canada by the federal government furthers this rationale. PPP Canada explicitly outlines when P3s are the right alternative for certain projects. This crown corporation’s rationale for choosing P3s would be when the benefits are greater than the costs through calculation of risk, expectation, and value for money analysis. Value-for-money analysis is important because it compares the project cost by using the traditional public sector delivery to the P3 model to see if using P3 of an alternative is beneficial. It also states that when there is a major project that has a necessity for enhanced risk management and a chance to leverage private sector expertise P3s are a potential option. There is scholarly evidence supporting both sides of the P3 argument.|$|E

5000|$|In essence, Riverkeeper is an {{environmental}} [...] "neighborhood watch" [...] group maintained by concerned citizens. Its constituents are not public officials {{and are not}} swayed by politics, but include members who defend the public use and restrict the private alienation of the river's benefits. Thus, Riverkeeper has engaged environmental justice issues, such as community park access. For example, around 1990, the City of New York Parks Commissioner restricted greenspace access by banning bus and subway transit, frequented modes of transport for African Americans, from reaching certain parks. Riverkeeper sued Westchester County and forced it to reopen six county parks that were closed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> but due to their proximity to a railway, were mainly used by minority communities. The County had not closed any golf courses used by affluent residents, {{even though they were}} greater strains on County funds than parks that offered some minorities their only access to the river. This was not the only occasion where land use policies threatened the health of the Hudson River watershed as a public resource. In 1990, a team of Riverkeeper attorneys took on developers and lackluster enforcement agencies to protect the reservoirs and streams that constitute the water supply for nine million New York City and Westchester County residents. Riverkeeper also united with a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP), in Ossining. During the 1960s, this oldest stable African American residential community in the Hudson Valley was rezoned industrial and has suffered social decline ever since. In 1991, Riverkeeper and the Ossining NAACP effectively sued the Ossining Planning Board to repeal an expansion of a construction debris processing plant that would have worsened diesel fumes and house vibrations at adjacent households.|$|E

This doubly curved exhibition platform, resembling an abstract crosscut through Swiss topography, measures 40 by 3 meters.

40|$|In today's {{medicine}} many {{decisions are}} {{based on data from}} the clinical chemistry laboratory. Basically laboratory results for a specific constituent serve a dual purpose (35, 65) : a. to recognize the diseased individual by relating the value found to either the range of values observed in a healthy population or to a range of values known to be compatible with a specific condition. b. to monitor changes in an individual patient. Consequently measurements in clinical chemistry have to be reliable in two ways. Firstly, they have to be accurate, which is defined (I, 34 a) as close to the true value or an accepted reference value and secondly, they have to be precise, which means, that replicate test results have to agree closely (1, 34 a). The question that has often been discussed but hitherto not been answered satisfactory is: how accurate and how precise do measurements in clinical chemistry have to be? In general in technical disciplines, requirements for accuracy and precision of measurements are set by the consumer needs. For example in steel construction the consequences of measurement errors are carefully considered. If the length of beams is incorrect or shows variations, all or some will not fit. If the actual shapes are smaller than designed shapes or if the strength of the material is insufficient the construction may collapse. If the strength/weight ratio is low the beams will be too expensive <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> Technical and economical consequences of each deviation from the ideal or required dimensions can be calculated, and, not unimportant, instruments used for measurements are adequate to register these deviations. In clinical chemistry consumer needs are more difficult to define. Firstly, ideal or required values are difficult to establish. Secondly, clinical chemistry measurements are seldom carried out with impeccable accuracy and precision...|$|E
