5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} Cylon models, <b>the</b> <b>Eights</b> {{typically}} show {{a great deal}} of concern and affection towards others. <b>The</b> <b>Eights</b> tend to be the most naive of the models and are often emotionally immature. While capable of convincing manipulation and deception, they are also vulnerable to forming emotional attachments. <b>The</b> <b>Eights</b> also have a propensity for fickleness, often changing loyalties to better suit their own needs and desires, with the notable exception of Sharon [...] "Athena" [...] Agathon, whose loyalty to Commander Adama, Helo, and her daughter are unwavering and uncompromising. Moore has also commented that <b>the</b> <b>Eights</b> are more likely to [...] "shoot things they don't like". Early in <b>the</b> series, <b>the</b> <b>Eights</b> were implied to be the most militaristic of the models and the most likely to have combat training; overall, an Eight is at least as good at combat as a Six.|$|R
