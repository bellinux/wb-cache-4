5|$|As Ewiniar started <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> {{coast of}} China, the {{government}} in Beijing ordered emergency evacuations for all villagers in low-lying areas. A reported 7,634people were evacuated from Ningbo, and over 8,000 ships were asked to return to dock in harbours in Ningbo and Zhoushan. The municipal flood control headquarters in Shanghai also asked officials {{to prepare for the}} approaching typhoon, which was forecast to begin affecting the city on July 9.|$|E

5|$|These {{military}} actions left Habré {{in control of}} Chad and in a position <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> expulsion of Libya from the Aouzou Strip, affected the international perception of Libya as a significant regional military power, and cast renewed doubt on the competence and determination of Libyan soldiers, especially in engagements beyond the country's borders to which they evidently felt no personal commitment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the battle}} was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time the morale of the 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, hunting was {{restricted}} to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The take is not believed <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years {{it would take to}} reach a formal agreement.|$|E
25|$|Monaghan writes that, around 1982, {{there was}} a {{noticeable}} shift in the non-violent position, and not one approved by everyone in the movement. Some activists began to make personal threats against individuals, followed by letter bombs and threats to contaminate food, the latter representing yet another shift <b>to</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>the</b> general public, rather than specific targets.|$|R

30|$|A {{dispatching}} {{model of}} economic accommodation for wind power curtailment through EWHs is established. Economic accommodation of curtailed wind power aims to minimize total coal consumption. If {{the integration of}} wind power does not lead <b>to</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>the</b> secure operation of thermal power plants, wind power curtailment will be reasonably executed, where EWHs are connected to maximize the cost saving.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> canal from March through the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and Ottoman Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, Shiva {{abandons}} {{the plan}} of invading Meluha and leave for Pariha with Gopal; they wanted to procure the deadly Brahmastra weapon, <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> Meluhans for peace with them. There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali {{that he was going to}} attack Panchavati. Alarmed, Kali takes the bait and leaves with the finest Naga soldiers in their pursuit. However, she realizes her folly and returns.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E

5|$|Ibrahim {{tried to}} enter Mani from the {{north-east}} near Almiro on June 21, 1826, {{but he was}} forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece. Despite Egyptian and Ottoman artillery, the outnumbered Maniots managed to hold off the Ottomans. Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses. When the Egyptians at Vergas heard that Theodoros Kolokotronis was advancing on their rear they retreated.|$|E
5|$|In 1226, Konrad I of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights {{to defend his}} borders and subdue the Prussians, {{offering}} the Knights the use of Chełmno (Kulm) {{as a base for}} their campaign. In 1230, they settled in Chełmno, built a castle, and began attacking Prussian lands. After 44 years, and despite two Prussian uprisings against them, they had conquered most of the Prussian tribes. Afterwards, the Knights spent nine years conquering the Nadruvians, Skalvians, and Yotvingians, and from 1283, they were better positioned <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> young Lithuanian state from the west.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by the Japanese <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E

5|$|Initially the {{depression}} was forecast to move ashore as a minimal tropical storm, {{and the threat}} of {{the depression}} prompted state of emergency declarations in Mississippi and Louisiana. It was the first tropical cyclone <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina and the destructive 2005 hurricane season. Overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall. However, the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where 20houses were destroyed and 30more were damaged.|$|E
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Beirut was a naval battle off {{the coast}} of Beirut during the Italo-Turkish War. Italian fears that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> {{approach}} to the Suez canal led the Italian military to order the destruction of the Ottoman naval presence in the area. On 24 February 1912 two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters, retired, then returned and sank an Ottoman torpedo boat.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kaiapit was {{an action}} fought in 1943 between Australian and Japanese forces in New Guinea during the Markham and Ramu Valley – Finisterre Range {{campaign}} of World War II. Following the landings at Nadzab and at Lae, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance {{into the upper}} Markham Valley, starting with Kaiapit. The Japanese intended to use Kaiapit <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> Allied position at Nadzab, {{and to create a}} diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{is still}} in the process of {{rebuilding}} from the events of 2006. It remains under-strength and is yet to reform its training and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue <b>to</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>the</b> stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
