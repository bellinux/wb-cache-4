25|$|My daddy <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the {{day that}} Charlie hung.|$|E
60|$|TREHERNE. Man alive, you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it {{soon after}} we were wrecked.|$|E
60|$|Cecily. Yes, he has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible {{state of}} health.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, I {{thought as}} you had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the beauty places in Thrums, and you ain't never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about the Den." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The governor,--that's my father,--he {{had heard}} of Mr. Seely. I wrote first as he <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> They knew <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it at Pollington {{as well as you}} do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind who <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> We've heard <b>all</b> <b>about</b> how you rescued {{a man and}} his {{son from}} the Rick Rack River. Oh, Jack! it was a grand thing to do." ...|$|R
60|$|After a {{while she}} dried her eyes, and when I came home she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
60|$|RUTH. Yes, sir. I {{called at}} his office afterwards, and [pointing to COKESON] that gentleman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
60|$|NICHOLLS (impatiently). That's silly, Mr. Carmody. Gaynor {{knows his}} business. (After a moment's hesitation.) He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Eileen's sickness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{suppose it}} will; but I've studied the matter. I've watched the men putting up new wires at Hetertown, and Mr. Lyons <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> he knew <b>about</b> it. It's easy enough. Very {{different}} from building a railroad." ...|$|R
6000|$|Christina {{pulled her}} poodle towards her {{and began to}} smooth his silky fleece. [...] "I like him very much," [...] she repeated; [...] "much more than I used to. Since you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> that <b>about</b> him at Saint Cecilia's, I have felt a great {{friendship}} for him. There 's something very fine about him; he 's not afraid of anything. He is not afraid of failure; he is not afraid of ruin or death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have seen Jenny very much," [...] said I, [...] "for I am sure she would have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> she could <b>about</b> this lady, whom I am very anxious indeed--you cannot think how anxious--to overtake. Will Jenny be here soon? Where is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little {{affair of}} Miss Bultiwell," [...] Felixstowe replied, gazing admiringly at Jacob's well-suspended silk socks. [...] "Mary <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] were Clarissa's {{first words}} {{as soon as}} they were out of the gate on the road to Mrs. Brownlow's.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has made}} me most miserable," [...] she said. [...] "I thought I {{could not have been}} more miserable than I was before he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|Lucy and I sat awhile, {{and it was}} all so {{beautiful}} before us that we took hands as we sat, and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> over again <b>about</b> Arthur and their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{says the}} old man, [...] "I reckon there ain't {{going to be}} any; and you couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger <b>told</b> Burton and <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We went acrost to the 'Albion' to talk it over. There's several bars there, and {{the landlady}} always keeps {{cotton-wool}} in 'er ears, not 'aving {{been brought up}} to the public line. The skipper <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> 'e knew <b>about</b> Mrs. Muffit, and we arranged that Artful 'Arry should come down at seven o'clock next night, if so be as I could find 'im in time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} entered on it," [...] said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her hands. [...] "Celia <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the will at the beginning, without any asking of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Rover, {{allow me}} to congratulate you," [...] came from {{somebody}} near by, and Ada Waltham came tripping up. [...] "Grace <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> your wonderful showing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I think I know. It {{is because}} I am Leslie Gray's daughter, isn't it? I know that father loved you--his brother, Uncle Willis, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the good}} opinion, I can tell you, Pathfinder, is mutual. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> last night <b>all</b> <b>about</b> your coolness, and spirit, and {{kindness}},--particularly the last, for kindness counts {{for more than}} half with females, my friend,--and the first inspection seems to give satisfaction on both sides. Brush up the uniform, and pay a little more attention to the outside, Pathfinder, and you will have the girl heart and hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, Beatrice Hill {{was saying to}} Sidney, [...] "Oh, Sid, that Miss Seeley you had at the prom is a lovely girl. I don't know when I've met anyone I liked so much. She was so jolly and {{friendly}} and she didn't put on learned airs at all, as {{so many of those}} Payzant girls do. I asked her <b>all</b> <b>about</b> herself and she <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>all</b> <b>about</b> her mother and sisters and home and the lovely times they had together, and how hard they worked to send her to college too, and how she taught school in vacations and 'roomed' herself to help along. Isn't it so brave and plucky of her! I know {{we are going to be}} great friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was from}} the four boys who were the fags of the four {{who had been in}} Frank's secret that I hoped to learn something, and I was not mistaken. From the three in the house I learned nothing; but when I came to Pearson, who was Barkley's junior and fag, I met with even more success than I had expected. At first, of course, the boy did not like to say anything; but I told him that unless he {{answered}} my questions freely I should have him up before Doctor Litter, and he then <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> he knew <b>about</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Carley, I'm shore {{happy to}} meet you!" [...] said the girl, {{in a voice}} of slow drawling richness. [...] "I know you. Glenn has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faraday <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> {{what you}} had done to this paper," [...] he said. [...] "I came {{to see if you}} would let me in on it. I want work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to {{make your}} acquaintance, Mr Berrington," [...] said the captain, holding out his hand. [...] "The native {{policeman}} has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> your friends--I understand them to be such?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, dear. I am {{engaged to}} him,--as his wife. He asked me this very afternoon, {{and nobody knows}} it but my aunt. When I had {{accepted}} him, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the story <b>about</b> you. He had very often spoken of you before, and I had guessed how it must have been. He wears his heart so open for those whom he loves, {{that there is nothing}} concealed. He had seen you just before he came to me. But perhaps I am wrong to tell you that now. He ought to have been thinking of you again at such a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Father John, I've {{only one}} more thing to say, and you'll answer me that as a priest and a Christian. God knows, I wouldn't believe any ill-natured story against any poor girl {{situated}} as Feemy is; but you know, such things will get about:--people say Ussher speaks of her as his mistress, instead of as his wife. Now, Father John, if this unfortunate girl, whom I'm ready and willing to help, has done anything really wrong, you would not be the means of bringing her into the house with my own dear girls! Have you, Father John, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> you know <b>about</b> her attachment to this man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl resumed her seat, {{and taking}} {{up a small}} garment {{intended}} for the youngest Wheeler but two, or the youngest but one, whichever it happened to fit best, or whichever wanted it first, stitched on in silence. [...] "I {{want to speak to}} you about Bob," [...] said Mrs. Wheeler, impressively. [...] "Of course you know he never keeps anything from his mother. He ’as <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the gells he has walked out with, and though, of course, he ’as been much run after, he is three-and-twenty and not married yet. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that none of ’em seemed to be worthy of him." ...|$|R
60|$|He wouldn't tell me at fust, {{but at last}} he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> {{the letter}} from Dorothy, and 'is wife reading it unbeknown to 'im and going to meet 'er.|$|E
6000|$|... "The ghost o' Sam Bullet told me," [...] ses Joe. [...] "Arter it 'ad chased you up {{the wharf}} {{screaming}} for 'elp, it came round and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Anna. [...] "Mysie <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it; and how Mr. David Merrifield {{married the}} nicest of them all, {{and how much}} they liked this Captain Armytage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no good getting mad at a {{compliment}} like that. The English all do it. They're a crazy breed. When they don't know you they freeze up tighter'n the St. Lawrence. When they do, {{they go out}} like an ice-jam in April. Up till we prisoners left--four days--my Captain Mankeltow <b>told</b> <b>me</b> pretty much <b>all</b> <b>about</b> himself there was; his mother and sisters, and his bad brother that was a trooper in some Colonial corps, and how his father didn't get on with him, and--well, everything, as I've said. They're undomesticated, the British, compared with us. They talk about their own family affairs as if they belonged to someone else. 'Taint as if they hadn't any shame, {{but it sounds like}} it. I guess they talk out loud what we think, and we talk out loud what they think.|$|R
60|$|So, we {{were left}} there alone, all that {{stifling}} day, in the Canal Rest House, testing and re-testing our story of The Boy's death {{to see if it}} was weak at any point. A native turned up in the afternoon, but we said that a Sahib was dead of cholera, and he ran away. As the dusk gathered, the Major <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> his fears <b>about</b> The Boy, and awful stories of suicide or nearly-carried-out suicide--tales that made one's hair crisp. He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the Shadow as the Boy, when he was young and new to the country; so he understood how things fought together in The Boy's poor jumbled head. He also said that youngsters, in their repentant moments, consider their sins much more serious and ineffaceable than they really are. We talked together all through the evening, and rehearsed the story of the death of The Boy. As soon as the moon was up, and The Boy, theoretically, just buried, we struck across country for the Station. We walked from eight till six o'clock in the morning; but though we were dead-tired, we did not forget to go to The Boy's room and put away his revolver with the proper amount of cartridges in the pouch. Also to set his writing-case on the table. We found the Colonel and reported the death, feeling more like murderers than ever. Then we went to bed and slept the clock round; for there was no more in us.|$|R
60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> three balls {{had been}} duly entered: and commented upon.|$|R
