5000|$|... "Hi, I'm Robert Osborne. <b>Thanks</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> us. This week {{we begin}} our star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E

5000|$|It's a {{bit out of}} {{character}} for me to pursue a holiday EP as I'm not a particularly religious person but these are songs that I fall in love with again this time every year... I like to call it a [...] "holiday collection for the rest of us" [...] as I'm always personally looking for moody music {{as an alternative to the}} same old [...] "Jingle Bells"... I made sure to approach things in true Gregory Douglass fashion - as haunting and depressing as can be. I thought [...] "Merry" [...] would be a suitable title since it's essentially as merry as I get musically. Four of the five songs are covers but there is one original song called [...] "What A Long Year It Was", which is the happiest of them all - go figure. I hope you enjoy it and <b>thanks</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> supporting independent music! Gregory Douglass ...|$|R
40|$|Enumerating all {{the ways}} in which I am {{grateful}} to Konstantin would essentially double the length of this document, so I’ll save all that stuff for my autobiography. But I will note here that he was simultaneously patient, engaged, proactive, and – best of all – ruthlessly determined to refine and sculpt all our vague big-picture ideas into digestible and implementable concrete pieces. He also provided remarkable opportunities to see and do things that are rarely offered to graduate students. What I’m trying to say is, that conference in Hawaii was amazing. The odds of me making it through grad school without an advisor of Konstantin’s caliber were precisely zero, and it is exremely fortunate that my talent for screwing things up is exceeded only by his ability to fix them. The tales of my mind-bogglingly embarassing failures {{over the last few years}} would also double the length of this document, and I think I’ll leave them out of that autobiography as well. But back to the point: Konstantin, <b>thanks</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> everything, and here’s to many more years of working together. Thanks is also due to various Professors at Rutgers, Georgia Tech and elsewhere who have been patient, helpful and (in a few cases) even willing to collaborate on various projects: Doctors Andrew...|$|R
40|$|I {{dedicate}} {{this work}} to my beloved parents, Ezera and Norah Kagambirwe, for their love, care and inspiration. i ACKNOWLEDGEMENT To God be the for the glory great {{things he has}} done in my life. Ni, ahabwembabazi Ze. My greatest thanks go to Associate Professor, Dr. Ishtiaq Jamil, for the stimulating lectures in organization theory and public policy, and more so for meticulous intellectual supervision of this thesis. I am indebted to the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) for financial support to undertake this program. I register heartfelt gratitude to my brother in the Lord, Dr. Tweheyo Mnason for opening the way to Bergen. I greatly value the intellectual debates and comradeship with A. N Freidrich Etiang which inspired this study. To Hope Bizimana (National Social Security Fund) and The Rt. Rev. Dr. Nichodemus Okille (Bukedi Diocese), receive my heartfelt gratitude for supporting my application. Particular appreciation is owed to the Social Security Sector and Pensions Stakeholder Transition Group (STG) leadership and members for the cooperation accorded to me while conducting interviews, and the NSSF for providing office space and an enabling environment during data collection.

5000|$|There. That is {{the main}} thing I wanted to say. Comics.com, however, will, as they have announced, {{no longer be the}} source. Nothing {{dramatic}} happened, really. I simply came to feel that the editorial needs of comics.com and those of “Pibgorn” were becoming more and more divergent and incompatible. For this reason I asked to be released from my contract with United Media in order to secure a new online home for “Pibgorn.” United Media most graciously, and reluctantly, agreed. In short order I hope to get Pib back up and flying.Meanwhile, you have seen the most current installments of '"Pibgorn." [...] Hold that thought. We’ll be back.All best wishes, and <b>thanks</b> <b>so</b> very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> writing.|$|R
5000|$|Joanne {{thought that}} Johnny had {{forgotten}} her birthday {{and goes to}} the Allegro and offers to work. Brock refuses to let her spend her birthday that way and gives her a present. It is a gold pendant with an inscription reading [...] "I am beautiful." [...] he tells her to let it be a reminder to help her stay on her diet. Johnny had indeed forgotten her birthday but is reminded when he glances at the calendar in his office, as he's holding Peg. Johnny races home with a bouquet of carnations and a bracelet for Joanne. She is very happy, and doubly so when he agrees {{to take her to the}} movies. He had also agreed to have lunch with Peg and her father, but is a bit disturbed that the Allegro is the chosen restaurant. Peg and Stuart have already been seated when he arrives, and after a few words with Joanne at the bar, he joins them. Stuart <b>thanks</b> Jack <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> helping Peg.At home that night Joanne says she can understand why Johnny didn't introduce her to his friends at lunch. She's so fat. When he presses her about her eating problem, she confesses to having had an abortion rather than mess up his life with her child she knows he doesn't want. This happened late in their first year of marriage, and since then she's eaten to fill up the awful emptiness inside. Oh hearing this Johnny takes her in his arms and kisses her. It's the first affection he's shown her in ages. He's been showing more affection to Peg however and has not only met her father, but has offered to give Peg a key to his office.|$|R
