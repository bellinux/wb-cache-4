5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can be caused by <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> mice between inland and coastal populations, or <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E

5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but {{this might not be}} true in all cases.|$|E
5|$|New {{terrain is}} {{available}} in the game: Wasteland, which impedes <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> ground vehicles; Ruins, which provide a minor defense bonus for ground units and hiding places in Fog of War; Fire, which is impassable and illuminates the surrounding area during Fog of War; Rough Sea, which impedes <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> naval units; Mist, which provides a defense bonus and hiding places for naval units; and Meteors and Plasma. Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E

There is no camera movement, other than <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> the car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} agency, {{the feeling of}} being causally involved in an action. This is the feeling that leads us to attribute an action to ourselves rather than to another person. We were interested in the effects of experimentally modulating this experience on brain areas known to be involved in action recognition and self-recognition. We used a device that allowed us to modify the subject's degree <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> a virtual hand presented on a screen. Four main conditions were used: (1) a condition where the subject had a full control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual hand, (2) a condition where <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual hand appeared rotated by 25 degrees with respect to <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> made by <b>the</b> subject, (3) a condition where <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual hand appeared rotated by 50 degrees, and (4) a condition where <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual hand were produced by another person and did not correspond to <b>the</b> subject's <b>movements.</b> <b>The</b> activity <b>of</b> two main brain areas appeared to be modulated by the degree <b>of</b> discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> executed and <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> seen on <b>the</b> screen. In the inferior part of the parietal lobe, specifically on the right side, the less the subject felt in control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual hand, the higher the level of activation. A reverse covariation was observed in the insula. These results demonstrate that the level of activity of specific brain areas maps onto the experience of causing or controlling an action. The implication of these results for understanding pathological conditions is discussed...|$|R
