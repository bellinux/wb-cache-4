5|$|A {{series of}} special episodes titled The Bill Uncovered were {{produced}} {{to reflect the}} stories of select characters and events. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Bill Uncovered : Des and Reg (2004) – The story of the unusual friendship between PC Des Taviner and PC Reg Hollis, traversing their history from Des's first day at Sun Hill to his death in a Sun Hill cell.|$|E
5|$|Bedell-Sivright {{was later}} chosen to tour with two {{different}} British Isles teams. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 1903 tour of South Africa under the captaincy of fellow Scottish international Mark Morrison. Although at {{the centre of}} the British Isles pack, Beddel-Sivright did not play in any of the test matches. He played in the first 12 tour matches, where the team won six and lost six, but was injured thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Between 1922 and 1932 {{the clinic}} offered free or reduced-cost {{psychoanalysis}} to 1,445 men and 800 women, many suffering from shell shock after World War I. It {{was the second}} such clinic to open under Freud's direction; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Poliklinik in Berlin, set up in 1920 by Max Eitingon and Ernst Simmel.|$|E

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{joining the}} NHL in 1991, Bure competed for the Soviet Union in several junior, {{international}} tournaments. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 1988 Quebec Esso Cup, an under-17 tournament (now {{known as the}} World U-17 Hockey Challenge) held in Quebec City, where he earned a gold medal. That same year, he competed in his first of two consecutive European Junior Championships, winning a bronze medal.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{supporters}} {{have been involved}} in two major tragedies. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the Heysel Stadium, with 39 people—mostly Italians and Juventus fans—dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition. The second was the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{has hosted}} five rugby league matches. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 1989 Charity Shield played between Widnes Vikings and Wigan Warriors. The 1991 World Club Challenge between the Wigan, {{the winners of}} the RFL Championship, and Penrith Panthers, winners of the Australian NSWRL Premiership, was held at the ground with an {{attendance}} of 20,152 people. In 1997, St. Helens used the ground for their Super League II home game against Castleford Tigers; the attendance was 12,329. The stadium hosted the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations Final, in front of 40,042 people.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} two classifications for teams. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, {{the times of}} the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added, and {{the team with the}} lowest time is leading team. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} levels of {{advanced}} schooling. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, which concentrated on teaching officers both command and staff duties related to corps and divisions. Although viewed as competitive, nearly all officers eventually attended. A 1937 survey showed that 97 percent of the Army's colonels and 95 percent of its lieutenant colonels were graduates. There were two senior schools, the Army War College and the Army Industrial College. The Army War College taught the handling of higher formations. The Army Industrial College taught industrial mobilization.|$|E
5|$|This tranquility {{disappeared}} {{when the}} British consul in Rio de Janeiro, William Dougal Christie, nearly sparked {{a war between}} his nation and Brazil. Christie sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents {{at the end of}} 1861 and beginning of 1862. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sinking of a commercial barque on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul after which its goods were pillaged by local inhabitants. The second was the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio.|$|E

5|$|Three {{fundamental}} documents had governed {{the territory}} {{now known as}} New Jersey. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Concession and Agreement, which was written in 1665 by the colony's proprietors Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, and included a provision granting religious freedom. After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers, the colony was split into West and East Jersey. Each had its own constitution: the West Jersey Constitution (1681) and the East Jersey Constitution (1683). The two were reunited in 1702 by Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on paleontology. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale. The second was the theory of plate tectonics, which helped {{make sense of the}} geographical distribution of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E

30|$|In {{this section}} we state the {{following}} lemmas which <b>are</b> essential in <b>the</b> proofs of Theorem  1.1. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> global existence of classical solutions to (1.1).|$|R
5|$|At {{the northeastern}} terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend {{southeast}} along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south {{to cross the}} river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned {{to be part of}} it. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Windlass Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Sanh's {{activities}} in the 1910s, there were {{two members of the}} Nguyễn Dynasty who commanded respect among Vietnamese monarchists. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> boy emperor Duy Tân, who was himself deported in 1916 after staging an uprising. Duy Tan's grandfather, Emperor Dục Đức, was the adopted son of the childless Emperor Tự Đức, the last independent emperor of Vietnam. The second figure who was seen by Vietnamese as a possible leader of an independent monarchy was Prince Cường Để. Cường Để was a direct descendant of Emperor Gia Long, who had established the Nguyễn Dynasty and unified Vietnam in its modern state. Cường Để was a prominent anti-colonial activist who lived in exile in Japan.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
