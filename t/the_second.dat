50|$|For {{the first}} time, Association Seconds matches {{were for the}} first time played as curtain-raisers to Firsts matches. When <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> {{competition}} was established in the 1920s, scheduling was such that <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> played at <b>the</b> same time as the Firsts, with <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> playing at home when the Firsts played away and vice versa. In the 1960s, as the Firsts gradually migrated from a Saturday competition to a Sunday competition, <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> had remained a Saturday competition, still playing at home on alternate weekends to the Firsts but on different days. Now, {{for the first time}}, <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> were played as curtain-raisers; and, also for the first time, <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> became a Sunday competition.|$|R

5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from <b>the</b> <b>second</b> floor.|$|E

Essendon again objected, and refused to play the match. Consequently, the match was scratched and <b>the</b> <b>Seconds</b> premiership was awarded to Geelong.|$|R
5|$|After {{taking a}} single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> of which is {{considered}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net.

The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries, and were keen to see Hamence do the same. The {{rest of the team}} left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone, only to see him stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. On the Monday, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> day, on a pitch that was taking spin, Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total.

50|$|Initially center seconds {{hands were}} driven off the third wheel, {{sometimes}} via an intermediate wheel, with the gearing {{on the outside}} of the top plate. This method of driving <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> hand is called indirect center <b>seconds.</b> Because <b>the</b> gearing was outside the plates, it added to the thickness of the movement, and because the rotation of the third wheel had to be geared up to turn <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> hand once a minute, <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> hand had a fluttering motion.|$|R

25|$|Although {{not defined}} by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10−7 of the pole-to-equator {{meridian}} arc, {{was very close to}} the length of <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> pendulum.|$|R
