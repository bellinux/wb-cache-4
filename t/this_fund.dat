5|$|Post-storm {{analysis}} showed that, while less deadly, Dean's first {{and more powerful}} landfall caused significantly more infrastructural damage than its second. Where the landfall occurred at the town of Majahual specifically, {{and the state of}} Quintana Roo generally, communities took longer to recover than {{in the rest of the}} country. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities and secured Mex$755million (US$74.8million) of aid. Combined with the state's contribution of $270million (US$26.7million), a housing-repair fund of over $1,025million (US$101.5million) was established. In the three months immediately following the storm, over 37,000houses were rebuilt or repaired using monies from <b>this</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E
5|$|The city {{government}} {{is involved in}} the economic development process, helping firms grow and attracting new firms. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund. Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from <b>this</b> <b>fund</b> provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.|$|E
