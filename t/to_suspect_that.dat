5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa begin <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Sideshow Bob somehow rigged the {{election}}. Lisa {{goes through}} the voting records but is unable to find any proof that the election was rigged. Lisa receives a message from Smithers telling her to find a voter named Edgar Neubauer, who will lead them to evidence of electoral fraud.|$|E
5|$|Others, {{such as the}} Traditionalist Youth Network, have praised The Daily Stormer for {{its reach}} and influence. Anglin's extreme tone has led some white nationalists <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> he is an {{undercover}} Jew, an accusation he finds analogous to believing that Jewish LGBT activist Allen Ginsberg was an undercover Nazi.|$|E

5|$|Prevailing on Elagabalus, she {{arranged}} that he appoint his cousin Alexander as his heir {{and that the}} boy be given the title of Caesar. Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year. However, Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin to himself.|$|E
5|$|Raju begins <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Mary is {{the missing}} Mahalakshmi. When Ammi {{tells him that}} Mahalakshmi had a mole on her right foot, he plans to sneak into her room at night but the plan backfires when they awaken her. After dreaming that Rao rescues her from David, she begins {{to fall in love}} with him.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is about}} a young {{merchant}} marine officer who begins <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> his ship's captain is mentally unbalanced and endangering {{the lives of the}} ship's crew. The ship's crew, however, believes the vessel to be haunted and cursed and several mysterious deaths occur.|$|E
60|$|The {{strangeness of}} his conduct {{and of his}} looks occasioned much {{speculation}} and remark. For a long time he was suspected of being crazy, and then every body pitied him; at length it began <b>to</b> be <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> he was poor, and then every body avoided him.|$|R
50|$|The 'ivy wreath' Callimachus {{mentions}} is {{the prize}} for dramatic competitions, from which {{it is possible to}} deduce that Theaetetus composed dramatic works. There is no reason <b>to</b> <b>suspect,</b> however, <b>that</b> he is not also the Theaetetus to whom six epigrams in the Palatine Anthology are ascribed.|$|R

5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E
5|$|Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) notices {{some things}} that lead her <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Dwight and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are dating. However, she discreetly {{abandons}} her suspicions when she asks Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith) if she noticed any office romances and Phyllis guesses that Pam meant her and Jim. Jim and Pam bond when she sees Jim's room {{for the first time}} and looks through his high school year book.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, {{knowing full well}} that they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent because they are ignorant {{of the fact that they}} have the right to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required <b>to</b> disclose <b>to</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>that</b> they have the right to decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony <b>that</b> the <b>suspect</b> consented <b>to</b> the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh all questions of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.|$|R

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Stakeknife case, where a highly placed member of the IRA was {{revealed}} to be a British double-agent, it began <b>to</b> be <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Freddie Scappaticci - who ran the same IRA's Internal Security Unit that tortured and killed Mr. Oliver - killed Thomas Oliver to conceal his identity.|$|R
5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), {{was old enough to}} assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Fantasy Records {{had failed}} to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5000|$|This caused {{controversy}} {{for several}} reasons. Primarily, critics {{believed that the}} government's use of the material witness statute <b>to</b> detain <b>suspects</b> was an evasion of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which provides some protections <b>to</b> criminal <b>suspects</b> <b>that</b> were apparently ignored in the arrests of the material witness detainees post-September 11. Secondarily, legal critics took issue with {{the application of the}} material witness statute to grand jury proceedings.|$|R
50|$|For {{evidence}} from a lineup to be admissible in court, the lineup itself must be conducted fairly. The police may not {{say or do}} anything that persuades the witness <b>to</b> identify the <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> they prefer. This includes loading the lineup with people who look very dissimilar <b>to</b> the <b>suspect.</b>|$|R

5|$|Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King of Dublin in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is reason <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and the Irish Sea region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced there was no reason <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{professor}} has {{the telephone}} recording of someone {{claiming to be}} one of the missing boys calling up his parents' home. However, the mother does not appear to be shocked to receive a call from her son. This leads the professor <b>to</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>that</b> the father and mother of this boy may know more than they have been letting on. While visiting the boys' home, everyone, from the boy's parents to his grandmother act strangely. The professor convinces the authorities to dig up the boy's home, but they find nothing. Nevertheless, the accusation destroys the family's reputation and the father dies without having cleared his name. Kang Ji-seung is soon transferred back to the city while the professor losses his job at the university.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of the plot, however, lay an Italian, the pulp plays and novels of Camillo Federici (1749–1802) [...] a former actor whose {{prolific}} vulgarizations of Schiller and Kotzebue set Italian librettists scribbling for four decades. Indeed, without him it is <b>to</b> be <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Sir Walter Scott would never have captured the imagination of so many poets, nor for so long.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 90's, Amuso's {{relationship}} with DeFede began <b>to</b> sour. <b>Suspecting</b> <b>that</b> DeFede was hiding {{money from the}} family, Amuso replaced him as acting boss with Steven Crea, head of the family's powerful Bronx faction. Once Crea took over, family profits rose enormously. That was enough to convince Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits; Amuso reportedly decided to have him murdered.|$|R
5|$|In this episode, flashbacks {{depict the}} story behind Claire's pregnancy. Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides {{to go to an}} {{adoption}} agency out of a belief that she will struggle to raise it alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> somebody is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) – Patrick and {{his wife}} Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in {{seemingly}} preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcasesnot realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.|$|E
