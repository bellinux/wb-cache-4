5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{left with}} the first 61 evacuees, {{including}} all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of two Chinooks designated the Rotary Wing Group operated in Afghanistan during 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The initial detachment arrived at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006, and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country. The upgrades <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> had received proved successful, and {{allowed them to}} operate in combat alongside other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn in September 2006 <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> remained {{in the country and}} were used to support Coalition forces, with a particular emphasis on the Australian units located in Urozgan Province. The detachment was withdrawn to Australia in February 2007, and did not deploy again until February 2008. During this period all six helicopters received upgrades, which included new engines and blue force tracker equipment. During subsequent years the detachment was withdrawn to Australia during the Afghan winters, and redeployed each spring. By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013 <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> had flown more than 6,000 hours in combat and transported almost 40,000 personnel. Preparing for and sustaining the Rotary Wing Group rotations absorbed most of C Squadron's resources throughout this period, and Chinooks were rarely available for other Army training or operational tasks.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E
5000|$|Two accomplices hired a trip on a sight-seeing {{helicopter}} from Agios Kosmas, {{a coastal}} suburb of Athens.

5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon heavily {{to support the}} British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start of}} the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack <b>the</b> <b>helicopters.</b>|$|E
5|$|During 2005 the Australian Government {{decided to}} deploy Chinooks to Afghanistan {{as part of}} the Australian forces in the country. The need to prepare for this task contributed to a {{decision}} in October that year to dispatch Black Hawks rather than Chinooks to Pakistan as part of Australia's contribution to the international relief efforts which followed the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, despite the Chinooks being better suited for operations at the high altitudes affected by the disaster. In November 2005 the Government authorised a program of urgent upgrades to the CH-47Ds to improve their combat readiness ahead of being deployed to Afghanistan. The upgrades included fitting <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> with extra armour as well as new electronic warfare and communications systems. The helicopters' machine guns were also replaced with miniguns. A longer-term plan to upgrade <b>the</b> <b>helicopters,</b> designated Phase 5 of project AIR 9000, was also in place at this time. This was to involve two sub-phases: under Phase 5A new engines were purchased in December 2004, and were scheduled to be fitted in late 2006. It was also planned to put <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> through a mid-life update as part of Phase 5B, enabling them to remain in service until around 2025.|$|E
5|$|Helikopter Service flew between Bodø Airport to Værøy and Røst—the island {{community}} {{further out}} from Værøy—with three weekly services from 1973. <b>The</b> <b>helicopters</b> doubled as serving for {{search and rescue}} duty; in case they were needed for the latter flights to Værøy and Røst were cancelled. The regional airports in Lofoten and Vesterålen opened in 1972, with the Værøy and Røst service being taken over by Widerøe on 1 September 1973. As {{they did not want}} to operate helicopters, they subcontracted the operations to Helilift. The service operated twice per day on weekdays and once per day in the weekends, using two sixteen-seat Sikorsky S-58Ts. Subsidies of 1.9 million Norwegian krone (NOK) was granted for the route in 1973, and the service transported 5,359 passengers (from both Røst and Værøy). At Værøy <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> landed at Hanna Bakken-jordet in Sørland.|$|E

Authorities in Belgrade claim <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots were warned they {{were not allowed to}} fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted. The EC dismissed those claims, saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers. The approval was forwarded to the Yugoslav Air Force operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of dusk, at 17:50 four Sa'iqa battalions were airdropped {{deep into the}} Sinai by helicopters flying at low altitude.

Once the system has detected that <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> has landed on the deck, the securing device automatically approaches <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> and secures it. The securing device and traversing system are then used to align <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> with <b>the</b> deck tracks and manoeuvre it into a hangar, all {{without the need for}} manned intervention. All ASIST electrical and mechanical systems are modular and are housed in the hangar or below deck level to minimize space and weight requirements.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E {{helicopter}} {{was being used}} for the installation of a rotating beacon atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon was attached to <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> for lifting by a chain sling. After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the chain sling from it. As <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> was departing, <b>The</b> hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by the pull of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>the</b> hook freed itself [...] towards <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b> <b>The</b> cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled {{in one of the}} main rotor blades. The other main rotor blade severed the tail boom which fell free of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> striking <b>the</b> side of the tower {{on its way to the}} ground. The major section of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> pilot. <b>The</b> subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot's licence was not endorsed for sling loading operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type... to undertake such a job.|$|R
