2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there.

60|$|Two years after, when a {{detachment}} of Wayne's army camped upon {{the scene of}} the carnage, they had <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> the heaps of bones and carry them out of their tents before they could make their beds, and they buried six hundred skulls on the field. Such is war, and we cannot look too closely on its hideous face, which is often so alluringly painted that we forget it is the face of a pitiless demon.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of {{a quarter of an hour}} there was a deep yawning hole in the sand, into which Dick peered with intense anxiety. The bottom {{appeared}} slightly damp. Hope now reanimated Dick Varley, and by various devices he succeeded in getting the dog <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> a sort of tunnel from the hole, into which he might roll himself and put down his lips to drink when the water should rise high enough. Impatiently and anxiously he lay watching the moisture slowly accumulate in the bottom of the hole, drop by drop, and while he gazed he fell into a troubled, restless slumber, and dreamed that Crusoe's return was a dream, and that he was alone again perishing for want of water.|$|E
50|$|Carving is the act {{of using}} tools to shape {{something}} from a material by <b>scraping</b> <b>away</b> portions of that material. The technique {{can be applied to}} any material that is solid enough to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it, and yet soft enough for portions <b>to</b> be <b>scraped</b> <b>away</b> with available tools. Carving, as a means for making sculpture, is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like clay, fruit, and melted glass, which may be shaped into the desired forms while soft and then harden into that form. Carving tends to require much more work than methods using malleable materials.|$|R

The Don was since dead, but King James's coronation sword and King Henry VIII.'s coat of mail still hung on the walls.|$|R
60|$|The master hesitated. He was {{conscious}} of being on delicate ground. He {{was surrounded by a}} dozen pairs of little keen eyes from whom Nature had never yet succeeded in hiding her secrets--eyes that had waited for and knew the coming up of the earliest flowers; little fingers that had never turned the pages of a text-book, but knew where <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> the dead leaves above the first anemone, or had groped painfully among the lifeless branches in forgotten hollows for the shy dog-rose; unguided little feet that had instinctively made their way to remote southern slopes for the first mariposas, or had unerringly threaded the tule-hidden banks of the river for flower-de-luce. Convinced that he could not hold his own on their level, he shamelessly struck at once above it.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} Jack began {{carefully}} <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> the moss and fungus from the stump, and soon laid bare three distinct traces of marks, {{as if some}} inscription or initials had been cut thereon. But although the traces were distinct, beyond all doubt, the exact form of the letters could not be made out. Jack thought they looked like JS, but we could not be certain. They had apparently been carelessly cut, and long exposure to the weather had so broken them up {{that we could not}} make out what they were. We were exceedingly perplexed at this discovery, and stayed a long time at the place conjecturing what these marks could have been, but without avail; so, as the day was advancing, we left it, and quickly {{reached the top of the}} mountain.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Maximus awoke, {{and sought}} to raise himself from his lair {{at the foot of}} the rock. But his first effort failed. The drift above him was too heavy. Abandoning, therefore, the idea of freeing himself by main force, he turned round on his side and began <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> the snow that was {{directly}} above his head. The masses that accumulated in the course of this process he forced down past his chest; and, as his motions tended to compress and crush the drift around him in all directions, he soon made room enough to work with ease. In ten minutes he approached so near to the surface as to be able, with a powerful effort, to burst it upwards, and step out of his strange dormitory into the sunshine.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} Thanksgiving Night drew near. At {{irregular}} intervals Bettles sent word down from Stuart River regarding {{the welfare of}} Young Cal. The time of their return was approaching. More than once a casual caller, hearing dance-music and the rhythmic pulse of feet, entered, only <b>to</b> find Harrington <b>scraping</b> <b>away</b> {{and the other two}} beating time or arguing noisily over a mooted step. Madeline was never in evidence, having precipitately fled to the inner room.|$|R
6000|$|Log Canoes {{are made}} by {{hollowing}} out a long tree by axe and by fire, and fastening an outrigger {{to one side of}} it, to give steadiness in the water. Recollect Robinson Crusoe's difficulty in launching his canoe after he had made it. (See [...] "Rafts of Wood.") It is not a difficult, though a tedious operation, to burn out hollows in wood; the fire is confined by wet earth, that it may not extend too far to either side, and the charred matter is from time <b>to</b> time <b>scraped</b> <b>away,</b> and fresh fire raked back on the newly-exposed surface. A lazy savage sill be months in making a single canoe in this way.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{investigation}} for pad conditioning was studied on CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). In particular, pad surface roughness {{was focused on}} various pad surface conditions. Pad conditioning under wet condition makes pad surface roughness finer than pad conditioning under dry condition. The pad surface with fine roughness contributes to rapid pad break-in and removal rate　stabilization. In this study, various factors of pad conditioning were verified to clarify the difference of pad conditioning between under wet condition and dry condition. One of major differences of pad conditioning under dry condition against wet condition was the magnitude of friction force between pad and conditioner, which generates stick-slip motion of pad conditioner on a pad. The other was removal efficiency of pad fragment <b>to</b> be <b>scraped</b> <b>away</b> on conditioning pad. Pad fragments disturbs a stable contact between pad and conditioner. Consequently, {{it will be possible}} to realize pad pre-conditioning without pasting pad on a platen by taking appropriate measures against the two...|$|R

A moment later he began <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> at the sides. I lit the bundle of flax. It flared up fiercely, and I thrust it out full into the beast's face. He gave a roar, and off he went as fast as his feet would carry him. They tried it a dozen times if they did it once; but the torch was too much for them, and the seal bone in its middle must have given them some nasty wounds, for I generally saw blood on the snow in the morning. Whenever I went to get a fresh store of meat and blubber I could see how they had trampled on the snow at the foot of the rock, and how they had scratched its face in trying to get up at it, but it was all no manner of good. I was chased two or three times by them when I went out to gather my cabbages, but I always managed to get into my hole before they overtook me, and they had learned to give that a wide berth.|$|E

Sluices 1, 2 and 4 ('shallow') are used to control the water level, while sluice 3 [...] ('deep') removes the silt. When the deep sluice is opened at low tide, a powerful undertow is created which sucks the silt out of the harbour and into the river. In March 1988, the sluice control was computerised and automated.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1968, upon being {{awarded the}} Chaloner Prize through the Rome Prize competition, Rappaport begins {{what would be}} an almost three-year sojourn in France; first living in Vincennes and the {{following}} year, through the auspices of Darthea Speyer, the American-in-Paris gallerist, is awarded a residency at the Cite Internationale des Arts.Although Picasso's Weeping Woman is suggested in these works in Paris, as is Tutankhamun's gilded face mask and Rouault's The King, in Biafran Madonna 1st ver. (1968) and Rabbi (1968), along with the formal structure in the Romanesque altarpieces of Cimabue in Father, Vulture, Holy Butterfly (1968), and the paint-encrusted shield-like shapes of Oceanic effigies in Death Has No Master (1970); it is his own etchings, and above all, the etching process itself: from rolling a coating of wax onto the plate's surface - to drawing into that wax ground - <b>to</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>away</b> unwanted lines after the plate is bit in the acid bath that leads Rappaport {{to the way he}} will soon execute in paint in a two-stage process the works of 1969 and 1970 that are shaped by <b>scraping</b> <b>away</b> the multiple layers of paint applied in the initial stage of the image both when malleable and once dry to form reductively the final image - a process to which the artist gives the general term [...] "in grattage". As such, the tactile, almost violent manner, in the acknowledgment of process and material in forming these primitive/modernist figurative icons which are as much carved and sculpted as painted and the resulting symbolism that explores the devastation of time upon man's endeavors or portrays malevolence against the innocent anticipates Neo-Expressionism and relates to the work of Anselm Kiefer.Two years later in the autumn of 1970, while his solo exhibition of the more recent of these [...] "iconic abstractions" [...] is hanging at the Cite des Arts, Rappaport, upon reading Thomas Mann's [...] "Joseph and His Brothers", begins Joseph Accused (1970-1971) followed by Joseph in the Pit (1971) and Jacob in Mourning (1971) which are made in a scratchboard-like technique in which the drawn image is scratched through the dry surface layer of cadmium red into the base layers of turquoise and yellow-white on the canvas - a method to which the artist also gives the term [...] "grattage", and which its effect in Joseph Accused suggests ancient Egyptian temple wall reliefs precisely cut into red granite in which the figures are styled as a consequence in shallow space, deliberately flattened and silhouetted by overstated contours.|$|R

Among his rust paintings is a series titled Blue Moon. In a magazine interview, Little said the red rust is reminiscent of North Carolina's red clay soil and rusty tin roofs, and the cerulean blue that appears among abstract forms, its sky. A life-threatening illness in 2013, propelled Little's work in oxidation painting.

Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than [...] with the longest recorded only [...] Only males have horns. Female Javan rhinos are the only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of {{an inch or two}} in height. The Javan rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting, but instead uses it <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> mud <b>away</b> in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (Black, Sumatran, and Indian), the Javan rhino has a long, pointed, upper lip which helps in grabbing food. Its lower incisors are long and sharp; when the Javan rhino fights, it uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned molars are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan rhino smells and hears well, but has very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the complex {{relationships}} between, {{and some of the}} everyday practices that go into, remem- bering and forgetting within a conflicted political field. The object of this analysis is a set of murals in an eco- nomically and socially marginal housing estate on the out- skirts of Dublin, and some of the social activities that they either commemorate or pass over. This analysis requires an ‘archaeology’ of a sort, in the sense that both virtual and material layers have <b>to</b> be <b>scraped</b> <b>away,</b> not <b>to</b> reveal some deeper truth, but to outline the field of forces that create truth-effects within this context (Foucault 1973 a, Rabinow 1996). If this process is conducted carefully with due regard for local knowledge, however, the rewards are high. An obscure wall in an unfashionable Dublin suburb that most people in the capital have never been to (and that many people would never want to visit), displays multiple and conflicting configurations of violence, resistance, community, ownership, even hope. To understand this wall, though, an entire local world needs to be outlined, and the connections between this local world and national and transnational forces need to be appreciated. Perhaps appropriately, the analysis begins and ends with a defaced tabula rasa...|$|R

The two windows were small and closely barred with the first iron that Tarzan had seen in Pal-ul-don. The bars were let into holes in the casing, and the whole so strongly and neatly contrived that escape seemed impossible. Yet within a few minutes of his incarceration Tarzan had commenced to undertake his escape.

50|$|In northeastern Minnesota, {{the glaciers}} were {{thousands}} of feet thick. As the glaciers moved through the area they eroded large quantities of rock away. Ice itself is not very abrasive, but by picking up and moving pieces of rock it was able <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> softer underlying materials. Volcanic rocks underlie the area. Along the Rove region of the Arrowhead Region, there are multiple tilted layers of volcanic rocks interspersed with layers of shale; the shalelayers are softer than the volcanic basalt. As the glaciers eroded the materials, the shales were removed. The topography in the Rove region alternates hills (composed of diabase) and valleys (former shale layers); these hills and valley orient in a west to east direction. Many of these valleys are now lakes. Because the lakes are oriented west-east, visitors to the Rove region think that the ice moved in an east-west direction. Glacial striations (scratches) show that the ice moved from north-to-south, perpendicular to {{the orientation of the}} lakebeds themselves.|$|E
50|$|Electrodesiccation and {{curettage}} (EDC, {{also known}} as curettage and cautery, simply curettage) is accomplished by using a round knife, or curette, <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> the soft cancer. The skin is then burned with an electric current. This further softens the skin, allowing for the knife to cut more deeply with the next layer of curettage. The cycle is repeated, with a safety margin of curettage of normal skin around the visible tumor. This cycle is repeated 3 to 5 times, and the free skin margin treated is usually 4 to 6 mm. Cure rate is very much user-dependent and depends also on the size and type of tumor. Infiltrative or morpheaform BCCs {{can be difficult to}} eradicate with EDC. Generally, this method is used on cosmetically unimportant areas like the trunk (torso). Some physicians believe that it is acceptable to utilize EDC on the face of elderly patients over the age of 70. However, with increasing life expectancy, such an objective criterion cannot be supported. The cure rate can vary, depending on the aggressiveness of the EDC and the free margin treated. Some advocate curettage alone without electrodesiccation, and with the same cure rate.|$|E

5000|$|Now {{what we have}} {{received}} as being the way to surgically remove all fatty tissue as follows: After undressing the animal, they tear away the outer ruminant stomach from the hind legs unto the chest-wall cavity, and they take out the inner stomach, and remove, in its entirety, the blanket-like covering suet which is spread out over it. And they take special precautions over the thin of suet which {{is connected to the}} large intestines, which {{is at the end of}} place called, the [...] "coils of the ileum" [...] (Heb. Hadar Hakanoh), near the place where he excretes excrement, and which, on the one side, the [...] "suet of the innards" [...] is attached, while on the other side, the fat of the kanoh (ileum). That suet which lies next to it is the suet of the small intestines, which is prohibited according to the Geonim, of blessed memory. They take precaution, likewise, over that side which clings somewhat unto the ileum (Heb. Senei Dhebei = [...] "hatred of wolves"), surgically removing all of it thoroughly. They also take precaution to remove all of the suet that is found upon the abomasum (Heb. Kevah) externally, which is known as the ḥūmṣā, until nothing remains of it. Moreover, they take away the suet which is inside the abomasum, from within, which distinctively adheres itself to the abomasum. Yet, that which is not spread out like a blanket is that which is permitted, it being that which is ritually clean, and it is called bar ḥūmṣā. Now that which is spread over the omasum (Heb. Messos) the reticulum like a blanket is forbidden, which is an even layer of fat covered with a membrane and easily peeled, and which happens to be included among the [...] "suet which lies upon the innards." [...] Now they scrape away suet from the intestine which comes out of the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach) for the space of about a cubit (ca. 54 cm.), it also being the suet of the small intestines which is prohibited according to Maimonides, (Nachmanides) and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, seeing that it is a close neighbour to the suet which lies upon the innards. Afterwards, they take out all of the entrails (intestines), and the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), as well as the liver, aside from the mesentery (Heb. Ḥalūḥelet), for he still needs to clean it from the suet which is upon it. Afterwards, they peel away all of that lining membrane which is upon the flanks, which is forbidden on account of suet. They are scrupulous about its removal that nothing remains of it. The beginning of its place is from where there is the white tissue which is in the centre of the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs, extending downwards unto the thighs the hind legs and running width-wise along all the flanks, unto the spinal column (vertebrae). They remove it (i.e. the lining membrane) with the suet that lies upon it which is situate at the end of the thighs and which lies upon that flesh which is beneath the loins, which is called [...] "lonbel" [...] in the foreign, French language and mutemaziqah in Arabic. Now this suet is categorically included among the suet which lies upon the flanks. Afterwards, they pull out the five [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are upon the flanks, these being three on the right side and two on the left. The three on the right side, each one branches off into two separate veins, while the two [...] "threads" [...] on the left side, each one of them branches off into three separate veins, while one of its heads is attached to the spinal column, and they are called the [...] "threads (nerves) that are in the hip," [...] the [...] "threads of the walls the chest," [...] and the [...] "threads that are upon the flanks," [...] their prohibition being on account of suet. Now if they are pulled off while they are still warm, they can be pulled off altogether. However, if they have become cold, they can no longer be pulled off, and one must then poke around after them. Afterwards, they rend with a knife the thin membrane that is conspicuously located upon the two sides of the spinal column, beneath the loins and extending as far as the ribs. It is the place that appears to the eyesight as a whitish colour by the light of the sun or by the light of a candle from the hind side of the animal, and which can be seen on its inside, and where there is no flesh that lies upon it. After the membrane has been rent, they remove the forbidden fat (suet) that is beneath it, extending down as far as the edible fat that lies beneath that same suet, it being that which divides between the hide of the animal and the said suet, and it is permitted. Now he removes this suet from two sides of the spinal column, its length extending from beneath the loins all the way up to the ribs; while its breadth extending outwards until it becomes covered over in flesh, and once it has been covered over in flesh, is permitted. They scrape away the suet that is upon the spinal column from within, where lies the flesh of the loins which is called Arabic mutemaziqah, and they excise fatty tissue from the mutemaziqah, removing all of the forbidden fat (suet) that lies upon it externally. Then they dislodge the fat of the kidneys from the place of its attachment on the spine, above the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs, towards the side of the animal's loins, surgically removing all suet beneath it, or else they remove the central bone of the spinal column entirely. Afterwards, he opens up the pelvic bone that joins together the two thighs, the two thighs, taking out all fat that is within it which lies over the fat of the kidneys, it being the forbidden [...] "fat that is upon the flanks," [...] or what is also called Aramaic Tarba de-Aqlivusta. They surgically remove it up to the place where the tail begins in large domesticated animals, but in sheep they continue <b>to</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>away</b> the outer part of the fatty tail (rump) towards its inner side which knocks upon the thighs, with the fat of the kidneys and the flanks, all that which is high up at the top of the fatty tail (rump), at the place where it excretes excrement, extending as far as the bones of the fatty tail (rump). Now beneath it there is a marked difference in the thin membrane between the said suet and the suet in the fatty tail, as well as between the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which draw nourishment from the fat of the kidneys and the flanks. Now they scrape away all the fat (suet) which is between the sinews (Heb. Peqoqeloth) the loins, which in Arabic is as al-falakh (Coccyx), along with the [...] "threads (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that enter inside the perforations in the bones which join together the loins of the animal above, wherein ends the spinal cord. He then dismembers the thighs, each one individually, and opens up each one from its flesh on that side where the hide is attached, until the displaced tendon (Heb. Gid Hanasheh) can be seen which is on the hollow of the thigh, removing it and digging up after it in all the flesh of the thighs. Now on part of the of the thigh which is called Arabic mukheh, requires removing the tendon from without and from within, and on the calf leg which is called Arabic sā‘ed, requires removing the tendon from without and from within, and on the flesh which is upon it, which grows from the bunch of converging sinews the calf (Heb. Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm), called Arabic suqleh, with all of the fat of the tendon, in every place where it is to be found. Now there are found on the two sides of the of the thigh which is called Arabic mukheh and in its socket are known as stems (Heb. Qenuqenoth), as well as the fat (Heb. Shoman) of the displaced tendon, both being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away. Now there are in the calf, underneath its flesh, three small tendons, they being of the displaced tendon. Therefore, let him open up the flesh and remove them. And as for the spleen, let him peel away the membrane which is upon it, and pull away the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are inside of it which are three, their prohibition being on account of suet, and one is required to dig-up after them. The inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), the omasum (Heb. Messos) and the reticulum (Heb. Beith Hakossoth), (as well as the rump of sheep), require being cleaned of all suet that clings to them. The membrane which is upon the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs, alongside the liver, is forbidden on account of suet, and that which is alongside the lung is customarily removed lest he who sees it becomes skeptical, although it is permitted. They also remove the lower membrane which is upon the kidneys, it being forbidden on account of suet, also the tunic membrane. As for the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. veins and arteries) that are forbidden on account of blood, they do not have it as a practice in these countries to remove them, seeing that they cut up the animal in several pieces. Now may God deliver us from errors, and instruct his servants in the way of truth. Amen, may it even be His will. Original: ...|$|E
