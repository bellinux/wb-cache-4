A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E

This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
