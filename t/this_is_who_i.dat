But there was no movement, no organization, no club at Harvard, and so when we came back and lived together, it only lasted a couple of years and she left. I was so broken-hearted but I had no one to talk to. I hadn’t told anyone I was even in a relationship. So I decided to come out to my sister and then my friends and very shortly thereafter my parents. And that was probably ’79, so I was 38.

In 2010, Lady Gaga was touring for her second world tour, The Monster Ball. At that time she started developing ideas for her second studio album, Born This Way. The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester, England, described by Gaga as a [...] "magical message" [...] song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception. White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for coming up with the idea and the theme behind the song. [...] "We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but not like you think until you hear it," [...] he added. Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song, and explained with Billboard her inspiration behind the song:"I want to write my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors. I want it to be an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, especially in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone."On the 43rd episode of her web video series, Transmission Gagavision, Gaga told the interviewer that the greatest challenge she faced while writing [...] "Born <b>This</b> Way" [...] <b>was</b> how she could leave her insecurities behind her, and become confident.
