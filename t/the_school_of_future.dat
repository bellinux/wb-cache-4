40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{interest}} towards the ‘project method has been resumed in Russia.

For this reason it is necessary to regard prospects for the Project Method application in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>future</b> having evaluated its merits and demerits in the context of modern psychological and pedagogical knowledge. As the means of psychological grounding of the project method use we review a process of forming the idea about complex intellectual operations, partly or completely un-observable, such as generalization, analysis, synthesis, etc. Theoretical research was enhanced by the experimental work of a general kind which included organizing and conducting the contest of projects on mathematics during four years on the basis of Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Bunin Elets State University.

40|$|The {{world around}} us has changed. The {{pedagogy}} of the classroom has stayed {{more or less the}} same for decades, offering a stark contrast to the rate of change in other fields. Inspiration for change can be found in the veritable passion for new technologies, such as mobile devices and game technology, displayed by younger generations. The real challenge is to import these technological advancements into the classroom and, furthermore, educating teachers about the possibilities they hold. We have researched the core pedagogy of classroom learning and mobile learning for the last years. In this paper, we describe the School of the Future program and its goals and also what is the role of mobile and game-based environments. We will argue that classroom pedagogy must change in order to respond to modern requirements and those of the future. 1 The Background.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.)

As a result, changes have occurred in many areas including administration, financial management, staffing structure and teacher support {{in areas such as}} curriculum. This study investigates three schools that are members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Pilot Program and seeks to find the effect that the changes from the Program, have had on Curriculum Development and Implementation. The study reviews the literature available on the topic, in particular <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> self-managing <b>schools</b> in Victoria. Therefore it reviews information on <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Program. It also seeks to understand the effect of changes in curriculum policy and the provision of professional development. The study also seeks to explore the effect of leadership style on the implementation of curriculum within a school.

40|$|Master of EducationThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain an understanding of how principals perceived their roles to have changed since <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> program, and how they were prepared for their new leadership roles. Devolution and self-management are the major concepts underpinning <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> initiative. As such, <b>the</b> Directorate <b>of</b> <b>School</b> Education has been downsized and many of their previous responsibilities have been delegated to schools. A case study methodology was chosen as the most appropriate for the study in that generalisation of the findings was not intended, due to the small number of participants involved in the study. The experiences and understandings <b>of</b> five primary <b>school</b> principals were sought by means of interviews. The findings of the study indicate that the participants have perceived a considerable change in their roles. There was unanimous agreement that the management dimension of their role had become more prominent in their job. They also reported that they have had to accept increased financial responsibility and accountability compared to the previous system. On the whole, the participants expressed satisfaction with the program. Their main concern was the apparent job overload associated with the implementation phase. In relation to the preparation process, the findings of this study indicate that emphasis was placed on preparing principals to handle self-management in their schools rather than on generic management skills. The focus was therefore, on topics such as self-development, use <b>of</b> technology in <b>schools,</b> change management, financial management, and so on. Various preparation programs initiated by the DSE and professional associations were made available to principals. The participants' feelings about the preparation process was that it was adequate and appropriate. Their main worry was that the process was rushed. As such, they have not had enough time to work out strategies of implementing what they had gathered from the training. The study raised the issue of whether the introduction of the self management concept in Victorian schools will lead to improved student outcomes, which is the major objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> initiative.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 1999 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> in Victoria, for children with problems arising from disturbing behaviour in regular schools. It is these students who have difficulty learning, and cause problems for peers and teachers. This problem has attracted more attention in recent decades than ever before as educators and parents seek solutions for these students. The impact of changes in government policies in Victoria, especially <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Program, on students with disturbing behaviour is examined, together with effective means of supporting these students, their teachers and parents. The investigator defines disturbing behaviour and how it has been addressed in schools, particularly in Victoria. She examines <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Program, particularly Global Budgeting and its impact on school policies and programs, focussing on the effect of these provisions in schooling for students with disturbing behaviour. The investigator has conducted a study <b>of</b> <b>school</b> principals in <b>the</b> area centred on Ballarat in order to examine their reactions to recent government education policy changes, and their effects on <b>the</b> <b>schooling</b> for such students. She discusses the implications of these changes for students with disturbing behaviour, including the most recent societal changes involving the youth of today, for example, the State Government initiatives addressing Drugs and Youth Suicide which have impacted on support and resourcing to <b>schools,</b> across <b>the</b> state.
