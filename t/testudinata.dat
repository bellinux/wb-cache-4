It can attack other barnacles, but only damaged ones: Pollicipes polymerus and Balanus glandula. It can also eat barnacles on the genus Alepas (see also Beeman & Williams 1980) and cnidarians Velella velella and Porpita porpita. The colour of the digestive gland in the cerata changes to bright blue when the animal feeds on Velella.

40|$|Turtles (<b>Testudinata)</b> are the clade of amniotes {{characterized}} by a complete turtle shell. New insights into the phylogeny of the group have revealed that a diverse assemblage of fossil turtles populate the stem lineage {{that lead to the}} turtle crown (Testudines). To aid communication, the terms Mesochelydia and Perichelydia are herein defined for two internested clades more inclusive than Testudines but less inclusive than <b>Testudinata.</b> The earliest representatives of <b>Testudinata</b> are found globally in Late Triassic (Norian) to Middle Jurassic deposits. In concert with the vicariant split of crown Testudines into three primary clades (i. e., Paracryptodira, Pan- Pleurodira, and Pan-Cryptodira), basal perichelydians diversify into three additional clades with overlapping geographic distributions: Helochelydridae in Euramerica, Sichuanchelyidae in Asia, and Meiolaniformes in southern Gondwana. Sedimentological, anatomical, and histological data universally hint at terrestrial habitat preference among the earliest stem turtles, but a more mixed, though unambiguously continental signal is apparent further towards the crown. A taxonomic review of Mesozoic stem turtles, excluding representatives of the Gondwanan Meiolaniformes, concludes that of 48 named taxa, 26 are nomina valida, 18 are nomina invalida, 4 are nomina dubia, 1 is a nomen nudum, and that 9 do not represent turtles...|$|E

The synonymy is recognized here, and this extends the geographical range of this turtle and provides examples of individuals at different stages of ontogenetic development. The peculiar structure of its shell, and its ontogenetic development, are unique to this taxon.

40|$|Most amniotes {{vertebrates}} have an intromittent organ {{to deliver}} semen. The reptile Sphenodon and most birds lost the ancestral penis {{and developed a}} cloaca-cloaca mating. Known as hemipenises, the copulatory organ of Squamata shows unique features between the amniotes intromittent organ. They are the only paired intromittent organs across amniotes and are fully inverted and encapsulated in the tail when not in use. The histology and ultrastructure of the hemipenes of Crotalus durissus rattlesnake is described as the evolutionary implications of the main features discussed. The organization of hemipenis of Crotalus durissus terrificus in two concentric corpora cavernosa is similar to other Squamata but differ markedly from {{the organization of the}} penis found in crocodilians, <b>testudinata,</b> birds and mammals. Based on the available data, the penis of the ancestral amniotes was made of connective tissue and the incorporation of smooth muscle in the framework of the sinusoids occurred independently in mammals and Crotalus durissus.

Diet was based on 77 individuals collected with speargun. Mean population density and biomass were estimated at 29 individuals/ 100 m² and 13 kg/ 100 m², respectively. This species is regularly distributed along the costal environments of the Trindade Island, with {{no significant differences in}} densities and biomass detected among the different collection habitats (reef crest, reef slope, and reef plateau).

40|$|Presented herein is {{the first}} {{morphological}} analysis of turtle relationships to examine the monophyly of many turtle groups by using only single species as terminals and by integrating {{a large number of}} primitive fossil taxa. The data matrix consists of 136 osteological parsimony informative characters with 169 derived character states for 45 fossil and 22 living species of the clade <b>TESTUDINATA.</b> The results corroborate the monophyly {{of a large number of}} previously hypothesized clades, but refute the accepted hypothesis regarding the basal split of living turtles. In particular, the primitive turdes Proterochersis robusta, Kayentachelys aprix, Mongolochelys efremovi, Meiolania platyceps, and Kallokibotion bajazidi are removed from their current position as crown turtles and placed along the phylogenetic stem of this clade. The age of the turtle crown is thereby adjusted from the Late Triassic to the Late Jurassic, which is relevant to testing molecular clock hypotheses. This revised topology has important implications for the evolution of several character complexes, because it implies that the common ancestor of all living turtles must have had a partially braced brain case and a primitive trochlear mechanism. Other noteworthy conclusions include the tentative exclusion of protostegids from CHELONIOIDEA, the placement of Platysternon megacephalum outside of CHELYDRIDAE, and the tentative interpretation of Sandownia harrisi as a basal eucryptodire...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} correspondence, Bour & Ohler (2008) readdress the {{question}} of whether or not Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789 is the type species of the genus-group names Chersine Merrem, 1820 and Medaestia Wussow, 1916 (Reptilia: Testudines: Testudinidae). The senior author, Roger Bour, co-authored the earlier description of a new genus-group name for T. hermanni (Eurotestudo Lapparent de Broin, Bour, Parham & Perälä, 2006), a name considered as an objective junior synonym of both Chersine and Medaestia by Fritz & Bininda-Emonds (2007) and Fritz & Havaš (2007), who argued that all three names are based on the same type species, T. hermanni. Bour & Ohler (2008) disputed this conclusion. In the present paper, we wish to clarify nomenclatural issues raised by Bour & Ohler (2008). Which is the type species of Chersine Merrem, 1820 ? Bour & Ohler (2008) claim that Chersine is a replacement name (nomen novum) for Testudo Linnaeus, 1758 (type species: Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758), and consequently has the same type species, because Merrem (1820 : p. 29) ‘only included Testudo as synonym of Chersine. ’ However, Merrem (1820 : p. 17) listed Testudo as synonym of his order ‘Schild-Pholidoten (<b>Testudinata)</b> ’ as well, indicating a different concept of Testudo compared to its current use. When the name Testudo was introduced, Linnaeus (1758) applied it to all eleven chelonian species known to him (Table 1), including sea turtles (Cheloniidae), New World pond turtles (Emydidae), tortoises (Testudinidae), and snapping turtles (Chelydridae).

40|$|During the Mesozoic, {{various groups}} of {{reptiles}} underwent a spectacular {{return to an}} aquatic life, colonizing most marine environments. They were highly diversified both systematically and ecologically, and most were the largest top-predators of the marine ecosystems of their time. The main groups were Ichthyosauria, Sauropterygia, Thalattosauria, and several lineages of <b>Testudinata,</b> Crocodyliformes, Rhynchocephalia and Squamata. Here we show that the palaeobiogeographical distribution of these marine reptiles closely followed the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea and that they globally used the main marine corridors created by this break-up to disperse. Most Mesozoic marine reptile clades exhibit a cosmopolitan, or at least pandemic, distribution very early in their evolutionary history. The acquisition of morphological adaptations to a fully aquatic life, combined to special thermophysiological characteristics, are probably responsible for these animals to become efficient long-distance open-marine cruisers. Generally, Early Triassic taxa were near-shore animals mainly linked to the Tethys or Panthalassa coastlines. By {{the end of the}} Triassic and during the Jurassic, the break-up of Pangaea resulted in the formation of large marine corridors connecting the Tethys to the North Atlantic and Pacific realms, a trend increasing on during the Cretaceous with the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean and the break-up of the southern Gondwana, allowing open-sea marine reptiles to spread out over large distances. However, if large faunal interchanges were possible at a global scale following a dispersal model, some provinces, such as the Mediterranean Tethys, were characterized by a peculiar faunal identity, illustrating an absence of migration with time despite the apparent lack of barriers. So, if Continental Drift enabled global circulations and faunal interchanges via dispersals among Mesozoic marine reptiles, others parameters, such as ecological and biological constraints, probably also {{played a role in the}} local endemic distribution of some of these marine groups, as they do today.

40|$|Turtles (<b>Testudinata)</b> are a {{successful}} lineage of vertebrates with about 350 extant species that inhabit all major oceans and landmasses with tropical to temperate climates. The rich fossil record of turtles documents {{the adaptation of}} various sub- lineages to {{a broad range of}} habitat preferences, but a synthetic biogeographic model is still lacking for the group. Results: We herein describe a new species of fossil turtle from the Late Jurassic of Xinjiang, China, Sichuanchelys palatodentata sp. nov., that is highly unusual by plesiomorphically exhibiting palatal teeth. Phylogenetic analysis places the Late Jurassic Sichuanchelys palatodentata in a clade with the Late Cretaceous Mongolochelys efremovi outside crown group Testudines thereby establishing the prolonged presence of a previously unrecognized clade of turtles in Asia, herein named Sichuanchelyidae. In contrast to previous hypotheses, M. efremovi and Kallokibotion bajazidi are not found within Meiolaniformes, a clade that is here reinterpreted as being restricted to Gondwana. Conclusions: A revision of the global distribution of fossil and recent turtle reveals that the three primary lineages of derived, aquatic turtles, including the crown, Paracryptodira, Pan-Pleurodira, and Pan- Cryptodira {{can be traced back to}} the Middle Jurassic of Euramerica, Gondwana, and Asia, respectively, which resulted from the primary break up of Pangaea at that time. The two primary lineages of Pleurodira, Pan-Pelomedusoides and Pan-Chelidae, can similarly be traced back to the Cretaceous of northern and southern Gondwana, respectively, which were separated from one another by a large desert zone during that time. The primary divergence of crown turtles was therefore driven by vicariance to the primary freshwater aquatic habitat of these lineages. The temporally persistent lineages of basal turtles, Helochelydridae, Meiolaniformes, Sichuanchelyidae, can similarly be traced back to the Late Mesozoic of Euramerica, southern Gondwana, and Asia. Given the ambiguous phylogenetic relationships of these three lineages, it is unclear if their diversification was driven by vicariance as well, or if they display a vicariance-like pattern. The clean, primary signal apparent among early turtles is secondarily obliterated throughout the Late Cretaceous to Recent by extensive dispersal of continental turtles and by multiple invasions of marine habitats...|$|E
