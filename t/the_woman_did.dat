The players were suspended from the team during the investigation. However, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not press charges, and the district attorney opted to not pursue the matter {{due to a lack of}} evidence.|$|E

Authorities believe the gunman started the shooting spree after finding his mother, the aforementioned elderly woman, dead on a couch from an illness for which she had been under a doctor's care, though this was unconfirmed. The disease was clarified in an autopsy to be metastatic lung cancer, although according to the woman's brother, it was breast cancer. A relative feared <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not die from the disease, and had instead been smothered to death by Aldridge. The woman was identified as 74-year-old Alice L. Aldridge.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{a flaw in}} the {{marriage}} ceremony {{is considered to be}} a last resort in releasing an agunah. It is rarely used as it is typically difficult in finding actual cause in most marriages to retroactively invalidate it. In Jewish law, a marriage must be performed in front of two witnesses. In order to release the agunah, efforts are made to identify reasons why one of the witnesses was ineligible. This is typically unachievable as strong efforts are made at the time of marriage to ensure the validity of the witnesses and {{the marriage}} ceremony. Another possibility is to prove that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not consent to the marriage clearly and of her own free will, so that the marriage ceremony is declared invalid. This too is not generally accepted amongst the halakhic authorities as there is generally no method to disprove intent. It is felt that the purpose of this endeavor is solely or primarily to retroactively delegitimize a marriage that was performed and accepted often many years previously. Annulling the marriage has no impact on the status of the woman's children. However, since it is not a generally accepted mechanism, it may leave the wife susceptible to a halakhic ruling that she was still married, and any subsequent relations with another man to be adultery. And it may lead to other halakhic problems, so it is only used as a last resort by the authorities that do accept its use.|$|E

500|$|Douglas {{was given}} an {{assignment}} in 1916 {{to write a story}} on the first woman to join the US Naval Reserve from Miami. When <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not show up for the interview, Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, where she was stationed in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed, and she cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, [...] "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".|$|E

The singer began {{to work on his}} self-titled debut studio album, which was released on 26 November 2010. The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, reggae-pop track [...] "Please Don't Let Me Go". Lyrically, [...] "Please Don't Let Me Go" [...] is based on a previous relationship of Murs', in which <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not love him back, he asks her to not to let go of him so soon. Some of the tracks present Murs as being critical of his ex-girlfriends' new boyfriend, including [...] "A Million More Years" [...] and the second single, [...] "Thinking of Me". Written by Adam Argyle and Martin Brammer, [...] "I Blame Hollywood" [...] draws influence from pop rock. Murs co-wrote the song [...] "Love Shines Down" [...] with Ed Sheeran, and it features guest vocalist Jessie J, while [...] "Heart on My Sleeve" [...] is a cover song written by James Morrison and originally performed by Michael Johns.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Abraham thus {{established}} his {{title to the}} land through purchase, and he buried Sarah in the cave. Abraham was old, and instructed his senior servant to put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swear by God {{that he would not}} take a wife for Isaac from the Canaanites, but would go to the land of Abraham's birth to get Isaac a wife. The servant asked if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not consent to follow him to Canaan, should he take Isaac back to the land from which Abraham came? Abraham told him on no account to take Isaac back there, for God — who took Abraham from there and promised Abraham the land of Canaan for his offspring — would send an angel before the servant and allow him successfully to get a wife for Isaac from there, and if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>did</b> not consent to follow him, he would then be clear of his oath. So the servant put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swore to him as Abraham had asked. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

Just three months after his release, Norris approached a 27-year-old woman walking home from a restaurant in Redondo Beach and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. When she declined, Norris parked his motorcycle and grabbed the woman's scarf, twisting it around her neck, before informing her he intended to rape her and dragging her into nearby bushes.
