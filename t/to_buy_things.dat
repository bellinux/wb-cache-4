5|$|On the {{day after}} Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers that she has <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> for dinner, but Yuichi is {{reluctant}} {{to go into the}} store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.|$|E
25|$|Status has {{far more}} {{relevance}} {{than in previous}} games. Now, many kinds of weapon, ship, and factory are not purchasable until the player has earned sufficient reputation with the vendor race. With some races, reputation can be earned through trade; with others, the player must earn respect by killing unwanted visitors in the race's space - such as pirates, Khaak, or Xenon. Some races appreciate both. By choosing to be an upstanding citizen, the player can earn {{the right to buy}} powerful new weapons, ships and technologies. By engaging in piracy, destruction, smuggling or other crime the player may lose reputation, and so may lose the privilege <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things.</b> The persistent wrongdoer may lose the right to land at stations, or even to enter sectors, being attacked on sight. Eventually, the player may find it impossible to buy many of the game's most powerful ships, weapons and technologies (although such things may still be possible to acquire through less orthodox means).|$|E

6000|$|Just as we {{was going}} up to bed Miss Pondar {{came to me and}} said that the gentleman had called down to her and asked if he could have a new-laid egg for his breakfast, and she asked if she should send Hannah early in the morning to see if she could get a {{perfectly}} fresh egg from one of the cottages. [...] "I thought, ma'am, that perhaps you might object <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> <b>things</b> on Sunday." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I wish {{to begin}} now, if I can, because I think I {{ought to make}} some money <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> for the family. I am ten, and other boys no bigger than I earn pennies sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she would}} have played. Oh! then you like the {{presents}} because they are our own making? I never thought of that. Was that the reason you did not give us any of your sovereigns <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> with?" ...|$|E
60|$|When he went <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> his <b>things,</b> {{they came}} to twenty-six dollars, and he passed over the new twenty-dollar bill, and also an old one {{received}} some weeks before.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{mind you}} keep quiet about it," [...] says the second mate, who didn’t want the skipper to know wot ’e’d been doing, [...] "because I don’t {{want to be}} bothered by other men wanting <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> as keepsakes." ...|$|E
60|$|Something of {{this sort}} Basil said, though of course not in apostrophic phrase, nor with Isabel's entire concurrence, when he {{explained}} to {{her that it was}} to the colonial dependence of Canada she owed the ability <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> so cheaply there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down cellar, an' you needn't take on no airs, ol' woman. I've {{known you}} <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> you didn't need time an' time an' agin-tins an' things, an' I guess {{you wish you}} had back that ten dollars you paid for that {{illustrated}} Bible," ...|$|E

60|$|He {{carried them}} to his room, rubbed his thumb in the {{lampblack}} on the gas-fixture, and smeared the magazine covers, then cut the leaves and ruffled the margins to make the magazines look dog-eared with much reading; not {{because he wanted to}} appear to have read them, but because he felt that Istra would not permit him <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> just for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{it would}} have been very dreadful, not having a regular trousseau," [...] said Gertrude. [...] "Mamma will, of course, do now just as she did about Augusta. He allowed her £300! Only think;--if we had been married at Ostend you would have had <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> for me before the first month was out. I hadn't more than half-a-dozen pair of {{stockings}} with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't stint matters," [...] Harry said, {{raising his}} voice. [...] "We may {{be here for}} {{the next two or three}} months, and the less {{frequently}} you have to go down <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> the better. It would be easy to account for your first purchases by saying that you were going on an expedition to the mountains, but you could not go to the place with the same story again." ...|$|E
60|$|Are these watchers and {{trackers}} sometimes driven <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> <b>things</b> in shops? If so, strange items must {{figure in}} accounts of expenses. If he bought those socks, would {{they appear in}} Sir Isaac's bill? She felt a sudden craving for the sight of Sir Isaac's Private Detective Account. And as for the articles themselves, what became of them? She knew her husband well enough to feel sure that if he paid for anything he would insist upon having it. But where--where did he keep them?...|$|R

"If we used money <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> with, {{instead of}} love and {{kindness}} {{and the desire to}} please one another, then we should be no better {{than the rest of the}} world," [...] declared the Tin Woodman. [...] "Fortunately money is not known in the Land of Oz at all. We have no rich, and no poor; for what one wishes the others all try to give him, in order to make him happy, and no one in all Oz cares to have more than he can use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will need}} <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> in the mountains, lad; and I would {{not that you}} should be driven, like the robber bands, to take food by force. It is true that they who go not to the war should support those who risk their lives for their country; but there are many aged men who, like myself, cannot fight, there are many women whose husbands are away in Gamala or Jerusalem, and these {{may not be able to}} afford to assist others. Therefore, it is well that you should have means of paying for what you require; {{otherwise}} the curse of the widow and fatherless may fall upon you.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} in a certain December, and through the village there was a {{pleasant}} little flutter of Christmas preparations. Captain Eli had been up to the store, and he had stayed there a good while, warming himself by the stove, and watching the women coming in <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> for Christmas. It was strange how many things they bought for presents or for holiday use--fancy soap and candy, handkerchiefs and little woollen shawls for old people, {{and a lot of}} pretty little things which he knew the use of, but which Captain Cephas would never have understood at all had he been there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, as {{the general}} advised you himself <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the <b>things,</b> he cannot blame you for wearing them; and I have not the least doubt {{that he is going}} to offer you a staff {{appointment}} of some sort." ...|$|R
50|$|The player {{starts with}} five tools, and must earn money by {{clearing}} the large {{field on the}} farm and planting crops, mining, or foraging. This money may be used <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> other <b>things,</b> such as livestock, and to expand the farm.|$|R
60|$|As {{might be}} expected, the unworthy cadets lost {{no time in}} {{entering}} one of the taverns located in Oakville, and here Flapp treated. Then, after cigars or cigarettes had been lit, they proceeded <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the <b>things</b> desired for the den.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had another}} [...] "discrepancy" [...] about him. He was always wanting us <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things.</b> On the shallowest pretenses he would inveigle us into shirt stores, boot stores, tailor shops, glove shops--anywhere under the broad {{sweep of the}} heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything. Anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a {{percentage}} on the sales, but in our blessed innocence we didn't until this feature of his conduct grew unbearably prominent. One day Dan happened to mention that he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents. Ferguson's hungry eye was upon him in an instant. In the course of twenty minutes the carriage stopped.|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} set down {{half of the}} virtues that are vested in a good courier, but I think I have set down a {{sufficiency}} of them to show that an irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a wise economist. My courier was the worst one in Europe, yet {{he was a good}} deal better than none at all. It could not pay him to be a better one than he was, because I could not afford <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> through him. He was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his service. Yes, to travel with a courier is bliss, to travel without one is the reverse.|$|E
60|$|A demand, however, can be inculcated. This is {{thoroughly}} understood by fashionable tradesmen, who find no difficulty in persuading their customers to renew articles {{that are not}} worn out and <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> they do not want. By making doctors tradesmen, we compel them to learn the tricks of trade; consequently {{we find that the}} fashions of the year include treatments, operations, and particular drugs, as well as hats, sleeves, ballads, and games. Tonsils, vermiform appendices, uvulas, even ovaries are sacrificed because it is the fashion to get them cut out, and because the operations are highly profitable. The psychology of fashion becomes a pathology; for the cases have every air of being genuine: fashions, after all, are only induced epidemics, proving that epidemics can be induced by tradesmen, and therefore by doctors.|$|E
3000|$|If {{we lived}} in an urban area we would have <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> all the <b>things</b> like food supplies, but here we can grow and supply {{ourselves}}.

5000|$|The song is {{a country}} pop ballad that chronicles the life of two characters. The first is a loner, named Billy, who is {{reluctant}} to leave southern Arizona, until he meets the song's other character, a female named Bonnie. Throughout the first verse, he befriends Bonnie and eventually marries her. According to the chorus, his love for her drives him to work overtime in order <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> her <b>things</b> that he knew she wanted because [...] "she is his only need". The second verse follows their marriage as they have two children who grow up and move away from home. Even as the couple become elderly, the love continues to drive him {{to go out of}} his way <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> her <b>things</b> that he has heard her mention she wanted.|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{looked in}} the mirror and smiled and tossed her curly head. She studied the oval face framed in its mass of curls, the steady gray-blue eyes, the soft, wistful, tenderly curved lips.
