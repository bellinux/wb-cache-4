25|$|LaSalle sales had {{consistently}} exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, so {{the question}} arises, why did GM decide to drop LaSalle? Evidently <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packard One-Twenty had been weighing {{on the minds of}} the executives at GM. Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. Since LaSalle had been a Cadillac in all but name for most of its lifespan, it was {{decided it was time to}} bestow upon it the prestigious title of Cadillac.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} their new-found attitude, the town holds a [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival. However, the festival soon goes awry because {{those responsible for}} building the stages and maintaining the rides [...] "didn't feel like" [...] doing a thorough job, resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel and more. Arguments begin, as everybody has been encouraged to always say exactly what is on their mind, and soon a riot starts. Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole [...] "Do As You Feel" [...] trend. The town chases after Bart, but Homer drives by in a float and saves him. The town gives up the chase despite the float's slow speed and decides {{to go to the}} old mill to get some cider. The Simpson family returns home where they {{try to figure out what}} <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode was, before finally concluding that everyone is fine the way they are and start to watch television.|$|E
500|$|New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley {{published}} {{a volume of}} memoirs, Time Present, Time Past in 1996. [...] In it, the Democrat mentioned having written a high-school report on Hanna—his history teacher, Bradley related, told him that <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1896 campaign is that money is power. [...] Bradley, a former basketball player, mentioned {{that when he was}} being interviewed in high school, he stated that Hanna was one of his heroes. [...] By the time he wrote the book, however, Bradley had come to believe in limits on campaign spending and blamed Hanna for a sharp escalation in campaign costs. [...] Bradley also stated what Horner terms mischaracterizations of Hanna: that he was the Republican boss of Ohio, and that he did his best to disrupt Roosevelt's presidency. [...] Bradley alleged that since 1896, Republicans have raised money easily from the rich. [...] Despite his condemnation of Hanna, Bradley wrote that he regretted that he could not find a Hanna-like figure who could play an analogous role in advancing his political career.|$|E

When the public views its urban monuments with sidelong glances out of the corners of its eyes, it accepts the monuments as natural and uncoded. [...] By intercepting vision with projections, Wodiczko replaces an unconsidered reception with a critical one.

2500|$|In his Nobel lecture, George F. Smoot (2006) {{described}} his own experiments on the Cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy as [...] "New Aether drift experiments". Smoot explained that [...] "one problem to overcome was the strong prejudice of good scientists who learned <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Michelson and Morley experiment and Special Relativity {{that there were}} no preferred frames of reference." [...] He continued that [...] "there was an education job to convince them that this did not violate Special Relativity but did find a frame in which {{the expansion of the universe}} looked particularly simple." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{pilots who}} flew the Whirlwind praised its performance. Sergeant G. L. Buckwell of 263 Squadron, {{who was shot}} down in a Whirlwind over Cherbourg, later commented that the Whirlwind was [...] "great to fly – we were a privileged few... In retrospect <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whirlwind is clear... A radical {{aircraft}} requires either prolonged development or widespread service to exploit its concept and eliminate its weaknesses. Too often in World War II, such aircraft suffered accelerated development or limited service, {{with the result that}} teething difficulties came to be regarded as permanent limitations". Bruce Robertson, in The Westland Whirlwind Described, quotes a 263 Squadron pilot as saying, [...] "It was regarded with absolute confidence and affection".|$|E
2500|$|In Quirin, Jackson {{ultimately}} {{believed it}} was a mistake for the Court to review military judgments in times of war and he solidified this position in his dissent in Korematsu v. United States. In that case, he stated [...] "in the very nature of things military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal." [...] His dissent in Korematsu expresses his belief that bringing those affected by military orders under the protection of the constitution would be a dangerous precedent and that the court should neither execute nor review such orders. He was afraid that the [...] "emergency that justified the classification (in Korematsu) would eventually be forgotten, leaving the constitutionality of the classification as <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case." [...] Jackson believed the court {{would never be able to}} perform its duty if it joined the executive in making constitutional shortcuts.|$|E
2500|$|The 50MG was {{developed}} in the 1980s by CIS to replace the obsolete [...] Browning M2HB machine guns used by the SAF. The CIS engineers learnt from <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unsuccessful American [...] "Dover Devil GPHMG" [...] programme, to create a modular weapon suited for modern tactical doctrines and production techniques. They succeeded and in 1988, CIS introduced the new machine gun and simply named it as the [...] "CIS 50MG". The SAF used the 50MG in its infantry regiments and as a mounted weapon on armoured vehicles and naval craft. The CIS 50MG is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed weapon. It has a quick-detachable barrel equipped with a carrying handle. The gun is operated using dual gas pistons, located in two gas tubes placed {{on either side of the}} barrel. The barrel is locked by means of a rotary bolt with multiple radial lugs that engages the barrel extension, eliminating the need for headspace adjustments. The CIS 50MG utilizes the same [...] "constant recoil" [...] system used in the Ultimax 100. A unique feature of the 50MG is its dual belt-feed system that allows for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard ball to armor-piercing Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP). Such systems are more commonly used in modern automatic cannons.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{break-up}} of I dritti due to financial failure, Fo and {{family moved to}} Rome {{in the hope of}} gaining work as a screenwriter in the cinema. There they lived next door to Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman. Fo worked for many productions, including those of Dino De Laurentiis. Rame worked in Teatro Stabile of Bolzano. In 1956, Fo co-wrote and acted with Rame in the Carlo Lizzani's film Lo svitato (The screwball), influenced by Jacques Tati, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. In the film, Fo plays [...] "a disoriented hotel porter cast adrift in a neo-capitalist Milan of skyscrapers and modern technology". Other films followed. In 1958, the couple returned to Milan when Rame was offered roles in a series of farces at the Arlecchino Theatre. Fo and Rame were subsequently based there. Fo said, [...] "For me <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cinema meant learning from a technical point of view what audiences had already grasped: a story divided into sequences, a fast pace, sharp dialogue, and getting rid of the conventions of space and time. Working on screenplays gave me an apprenticeship as a playwright and I was able to transfer the lessons of the new technical means to the theatre".|$|E
