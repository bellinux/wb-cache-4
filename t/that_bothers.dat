500|$|Henderson {{served as}} an {{assistant}} to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven seasons as the coach at Northwestern University. Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> me is that he's faster than all of them." [...] During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament.|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work took roughly {{seven months}} to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker {{spent six months}} editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. [...] "I like to blast through the footage {{to keep up with}} the camera. This way I can let [...] know if any extra coverage is needed", he explained. [...] "Often I’ll get word to the 1st [...] and he’ll sneak in extra shots if the schedule permits. Although I will have a first assembly when the production wraps, Peter will never sit though a complete viewing of that. He works in a very linear manner, so as we start to view a scene, if there's something <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> him, we’ll stop and address it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Panzram {{was arrested}} for {{burglary}} in Washington. During his interrogation, he voluntarily confessed to killing two boys. In light of his extensive criminal record, he received a 25-years-to-life sentence. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, he warned the warden, [...] "I'll kill the first man <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> me", and was given a solitary job in the prison laundry room. On June 20, 1929, he beat the laundry foreman to death with an iron bar, {{and was sentenced to}} death. He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote, [...] "The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{repeatedly}} accused President Barack Obama {{of engaging}} in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Russia. Hanson argues that Vladimir Putin is the embodiment of [...] "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled [...] "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: [...] "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, {{there is something about}} constitutional government and liberal rule <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, {{the more likely they are}} to bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much". Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people out of a sense of hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American [...] "reset" [...] diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine. Should Putin wish to absorb Estonia or other Baltic States, NATO probably would not stop him." ...|$|E
