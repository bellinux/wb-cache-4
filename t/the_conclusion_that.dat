5|$|An ineffectual start led to <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> deeper {{structural}} changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda {{of economic reform}} called perestroika, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and {{paved the way for}} foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E

5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective.

For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E

5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} Armistice was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter came to <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E

5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and came to <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E

Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910—with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing—to March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis.|$|E
