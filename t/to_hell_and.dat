5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperation}} of the United States Army and the United States Defense Department was extended for Murphy's media appearances to publicize the film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back. Among the 1955 celebrity television shows on which Murphy appeared to promote the film was Toast of the Town hosted by Ed Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Murphy {{enjoyed a}} 21-year acting career. He played {{himself in the}} 1955 autobiographical film <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back, based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in westerns. He made guest {{appearances}} on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.|$|E

5|$|Although Murphy was {{initially}} reluctant {{to appear as}} himself in <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back, {{the film version of}} his book, he eventually agreed to do so. Terry Murphy portrayed his brother Joseph Preston Murphy at age four. The film was directed by Jesse Hibbs with an on-screen introduction by General Walter Bedell Smith. Susan Kohner, daughter of Murphy's agent Paul Kohner, made her acting debut in the film. The finale shows Murphy being awarded the Medal of Honor while images of his unit's casualties pass across the screen. It became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Agni Purana {{mentions}} only 4 hells. Some texts mention 7 hells: Put ("childless", for the childless), Avichi ("waveless", {{for those}} waiting for reincarnation), Samhata ("abandoned", for evil beings), Tamisra ("darkness", where darkness of hells begin), Rijisha ("expelled", where torments of hell begin), Kudmala ("leprous", the worst hell {{for those who}} are going to be reincarnated) and Kakola ("black poison", the bottomless pit, {{for those who are}} eternally condemned <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> <b>and</b> have no chance of reincarnation).|$|E
5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J. Collins script The Way Back which created the fictional scenario that filming <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back had been so therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> <b>and</b> no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

5|$|Slipknot is {{well known}} for its attention-grabbing image, {{aggressive}} style of music, and energetic and chaotic live shows. The band rapidly rose to success following the release of their eponymous debut album in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album, Iowa, although darker in tone, made the band more popular.

La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will {{have to go back to}} Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E
5|$|Stiller {{had a few}} minor {{roles in}} the early 1990s, in films such as Stella, Highway <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> in a cameo, The Nutt House. In 1992, Stiller was {{approached}} to direct the film Reality Bites, based on a script by Helen Childress. Stiller devoted {{the next year and}} a half to rewriting the script with Childress, fundraising and recruiting cast members for the film. It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star. The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller's 2003 film Duplex and produce his 2004 film Along Came Polly. Reality Bites debuted as the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend and received mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|The Hibbs-Murphy team {{proved so}} {{successful}} in <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Back {{that the two}} worked together on {{a total of five}} subsequent films. Hibbs directed Murphy in Ride Clear of Diablo in 1954. The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed with each other for non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail. Veteran character actor Dan Duryea who portrayed villain Whitey Kincaide in Ride Clear of Diablo played a second lead in two more Murphy vehicles, Night Passage and Six Black Horses. The Story of Charles Russell with Murphy as the lead was under development at Universal but shelved after the disappointing receipts of Walk the Proud Land. Murphy, however, was enthusiastic enough about a biopic of Charles Marion Russell to give serious consideration tor his own production that would star Guy Mitchell in the lead, but no such film was made.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In 1988 Screamin' Toys produced a model kit where owners could {{build their own}} Jason statuette. The kit required the owner to cut and paint various parts in order to assemble the figure. Six years later, Screamin' Toys issued a new model kit for Jason Goes to Hell. Both kits are now out of production. McFarlane Toys released two toy lines, one in 1998 {{and the other in}} 2002. The first was a figure of Jason from Jason Goes <b>to</b> <b>Hell,</b> <b>and</b> the other was of Über-Jason from Jason X. Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film Freddy vs. Jason (2003). In April 2010 Sideshow Toys released a polystone statue of Jason, based on the version appearing in the 2009 remake.|$|E

25|$|The Damned {{are taken}} <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> {{received}} by Demons is {{in stark contrast}} to the previous one. Signorelli has gone to the extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of the horrible fate, the agony and the despair of the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of the Whore of the Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson {{had made}} two films together, Back Door <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>and</b> Flight to Fury, which were {{produced}} by Roger Corman and filmed back-to-back in the Philippines. After completing the films, {{the director and}} actor wrote a screenplay called Epitaph and presented it to Corman to produce. Corman did not care for the script but asked if the two {{would be willing to}} do a western for him instead. When they expressed an interest, Corman further suggested that they film two westerns, {{in a manner similar to}} the Philippine-shot movies they had just finished. They agreed and, while Nicholson started working on the script for Ride in the Whirlwind, Hellman asked their mutual friend Carole Eastman to write The Shooting.|$|E

The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts {{the second coming of}} Christ on the Day of Judgment as described in the Revelation of John, Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged.
