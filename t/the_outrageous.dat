5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with <b>the</b> <b>outrageous</b> things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E

Sheriff Lobey Dosser of Calton Creek was a memorable series that ran in the newspaper until 1956. Further adventures were published in the Sunday Mail in the late 1950s. The strip was extremely popular with Glaswegians and it merged the adventurous style of the silent era western movies with traditional Glasgow stage humour, particularly pantomime. <b>The</b> <b>outrageous</b> puns and surrealistic drawings have endured over time and now attract a cult following.|$|E

On Easter weekend 1979, three men dressed as nuns with habits they had procured from a convent in Iowa under the guise {{that they were going to}} stage a presentation of The Sound of Music, made their appearance on Castro Street. They followed with appearances at a nude beach, a softball game and the annual Castro Street Fair.|$|E
25|$|When the Moulin Rouge cabaret opened, Toulouse-Lautrec was {{commissioned}} {{to produce a}} series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them. The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings. Among the well-known works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as <b>the</b> <b>outrageous</b> La Goulue (The Glutton) who created the French Can-Can; and the much more subtle dancer Jane Avril.|$|E

In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was [...] "a bit of a concoction of different things" [...] and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing.

In [...] "Doug Pratt's DVD-Video Guide", Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, calls [...] "Pinkeye" [...] his favorite episode of the first season of South Park: [...] "We like it primarily because the subject – a horror satire – seems ideally suited for the show's irreverent attitude." [...] Eric Mink of the New York Daily News complimented the episode, which he felt illustrated many of <b>the</b> <b>outrageous</b> and shocking elements that had made South Park so popular. He said the episode was particularly notable for its graphic violence: [...] "Most sitcoms would have a problem doing an episode in which one regular character slices another regular character in half with a chainsaw. Not South Park." [...] Mike Higgins of The Independent said this episode helped [...] "cement (Eric Cartman's) position as one of the great, obnoxious characters of the Nineties", particularly through his Adolf Hitler Halloween costume.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, Korea {{was known}} as the [...] "Hermit Kingdom", a country {{determined}} to remain isolated from other nations, specifically from commerce and trade from Western nations, including the United States. In 1866, U.S. relations with Korea were troubled when Christian missionaries were beheaded by the Korean tacwongun, regent to King Kojong, and the crew of the General Sherman, a U.S. trading ship, were massacred. [...] Secretary William H. Seward, under President Andrew Johnson, demanded redress for what was perceived as <b>the</b> <b>outrageous</b> actions of the Korean government. U.S. Naval warships were ordered to the Orient, however, when Seward's term ended in 1869, he was unable to organize a naval expedition. [...] When Fish took office he organized the Korean naval expedition and broadened the purposes. [...] In April 1871, Fish ordered Frederick F. Low, minister to China, to take the Asiatic Fleet and voyage to Seoul. The purpose of the expedition was to seek retribution for the assaulted sailors and to open up a commercial treaty with the King of Korea. Fish had told the fleet not to use force unless the honor of the U.S. Flag was infringed by the Koreans.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} Courageous-class battlecruisers were {{designed}} in 1915 {{to meet a}} set of requirements laid down by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, with his Baltic Project in mind. They were to {{be large enough to}} ensure that they could maintain their speed in heavy weather, have a powerful armament and a speed of at least [...] to allow them to outrun enemy light cruisers. Their protection was to be light for a cruiser, with [...] of armour between the waterline and the forecastle deck, anti-torpedo bulges amidships and the machinery as far inboard as possible, protected by triple torpedo bulkheads. Shallow draught was of the utmost importance and all other factors were to be subordinated to this. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, responded on 23 February 1915 with a smaller version of the s with one less gun turret and reduced armour protection. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had forbidden any further construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915, so Fisher designated the ships as large light cruisers to evade this prohibition. If this restriction had not been in place, the ships would have been built as improved versions of the preceding Renown class. The two ships were laid down a few months later under a veil of secrecy, so they became known in the Royal Navy as [...] "Lord Fisher's [...] cruisers" [...] and their odd design also earned them the nickname of <b>the</b> <b>Outrageous</b> class.|$|E
500|$|Sex is now {{considered}} a bold, post-feminist, work of art, besides being labeled a [...] "cultural book". Martin Amis from The Observer wrote an essay discussing the book's cultural meaning. Critical theorist Douglas Kellner affirmed that with Sex [...] "Madonna became herself, an artifact of pop culture". French academic writer Georges Claude Guilbert (author of three books about Madonna) described Sex {{as one of the}} most successful publicity stunts in history whereas Russell W. Belk, author of Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, mentioned that the book is a quality product in marketing. In 1992, Madonna had generated more than US$500million ($ in [...] dollars) to Time Warner in sales of both albums and the Sex book, despite the negative feedback. However, Taraborrelli commented in his book, , that those [...] "who knew Madonna well at that time, knew what was really going on with her: the Sex book—and <b>the</b> <b>outrageous</b> antics that preceded it and would follow it—was really just something she used as a barrier between her and the rest of the world." [...] For years it had seemed to Madonna that both her personal and professional life was extremely scrutinized by the public and media, and although she had started this scrutinizing by her provocative works, she was tired of it. Being vexed at this interest in her personal life, Madonna fought back by creating the persona of a renegade, something so outrageous as to defy explanation, something found objectionable by most people. Taraborrelli said that in Madonna's view, [...] "she had no other way of fighting back". The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert analyzed the singer's provocative attempt in an article published in the newspaper: ...|$|E
