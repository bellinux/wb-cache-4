500|$|Randy {{tries to}} keep other {{countries}} from spending the space cash since that might alert the Intergalactic Police; however, this fails when Mexico spends its money on 32 hospitals and 7 water parks, and China spends it on 48 soccer stadiums. Learning that Finland is about to divulge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops,</b> Randy persuades {{the rest of the}} world to wipe Finland out in a nuclear missile attack. The Intergalactic Police pay a third visit to ask about the strike, but the South Park residents fake disbelief. By this time, Stan has had enough of the deception, so he tells the truth about cheating in the pinewood derby and returns his trophy; however, no one else on the planet comes clean about the space cash. McGeezax emerges from the officers' ship, having only faked his death. He reveals that he is really Kevern Zaksor, ambassador to new world testing, and that the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community but humans proven to be too selfish, greedy, chaotic and deceitful. As punishment for failing, the Earth and the Moon are isolated from the rest of the Universe (although it appears to have disappeared later on). The episode ends with Randy saying, [...] "Well that sucks." ...|$|E
500|$|Although filmed {{to create}} the {{illusion}} that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a [...] "surreptitious cut" [...] helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the cop car is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of the series required 800 to 1,200 film cuts, but [...] "X-Cops" [...] only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the X-Files logo to appear {{at any time during the}} episode. He stressed that he wanted [...] "X-Cops" [...] to feel like an [...] "episode of Cops that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." [...] The network, fearing that people would not understand that [...] "X-Cops" [...] was actually an episode of The X-Files, vetoed this idea. A compromise was reached wherein the episode would open with the Cops theme song, but the normal X-Files credits would scroll after an opening scene. In addition, the commercial bumpers would feature red and blue lights flashing across The X-Files logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cops</b> logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of The X-Files to prevent watchers from thinking that the show [...] "has been preempted this week by Cops".|$|E
