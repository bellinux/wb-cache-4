This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|E

2500|$|Madjo joined Crawley Town on 28 June 2007, signing {{alongside}} Jon-Paul Pittman and Tyrone Thompson. He scored {{twice on}} his debut in Crawley's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 home win against Stevenage.

He started his first game three weeks later, a 1–0 win against Luton Town. During his one-month loan spell, Madjo made five appearances for Cheltenham. Despite impressing Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, the club opted against buying the player on a permanent basis as a result of Downing having more funds at his disposal – [...] "Madjo had done nothing but impress all those at Cheltenham, but thanks to the extra money made available to Keith Downing, Cheltenham have set their requirements higher".|$|E
