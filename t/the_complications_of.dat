Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E

Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.|$|E

5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize <b>the</b> <b>complications</b> <b>of</b> attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>complications</b> <b>of</b> {{a stroke}} {{suffered}} by Clark in December 2004 {{had a major}} effect on {{his role in the}} special. After having Regis Philbin serve as a guest host for 2005, Clark returned to the special for the 2006 edition: due to speech impediments resulting from his stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest, but still made limited appearances. The death of Dick Clark on April 18, 2012 left Ryan Seacrest as the sole host of New Year's Rockin' Eve beginning with its 2012–13 edition. Seacrest has most recently been joined by Jenny McCarthy as a correspondent from Times Square, with Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas serving as the presenter of the Hollywood concert segments. Through its deal with Dick Clark Productions, New Year's Rockin' Eve will remain on ABC through at least 2024.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of <b>the</b> <b>complications</b> <b>of</b> the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} characteristics and treatment strategy for pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Methods　Clinical data of 15 PG patients (from Jan. 1995 to Dec. 2011) in Peking University Third Hospital were retrospectively analyzed, and its clinical characteristics and therapy were studied. Results　There were 15 PG patients, including 11 (73. 3 %) males and 4 (26. 7 %) females. In 15 patients, 8 (53. 3 %) had <b>the</b> <b>complication</b> <b>of</b> systemic diseases, <b>the</b> ulcer area was 2. 8 %(0. 5 %- 7. 0 %) of total {{body surface area}} (TBSA) before treatment and 1. 2 %(0. 6 %- 2. 0 %) after treatment, and 7 (46. 7 %) did not have <b>the</b> <b>complication</b> <b>of</b> systemic diseases, <b>the</b> ulcer area was 1. 6 %(1. 0 %- 3. 5 %) TBSA before treatment and 0. 4 %(0. 1 %- 0. 9 %) after treatment. The differences of ulcer area between patients with and without systemic diseases before and after treatment were both statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Two <b>of</b> them have <b>the</b> <b>complication</b> <b>of</b> myelodysplastic syndrome, whose ulcer areas were larger than 5 % of their whole body areas. One of them has effective response to surgical intervention in his stable stage. Conclusions　PG is more common in male, and is prone to have <b>the</b> <b>complication</b> <b>of</b> systemic disease, especially myelodysplastic syndrome, which is often accompanied by large ulcer area. The surgical intervention should be forbidden in its progressive stage. The prognosis is remarkably improved by surgical intervention of local ulcer surface on the basis of systemic treatment when the disease is in its stable period.
