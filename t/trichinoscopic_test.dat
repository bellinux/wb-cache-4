40|$|During {{the wild}} boars hunting season (2012 - 2013), 6508 adults were shot in Lazio Region, Viterbo territory. Out of the 6508, 393 {{subjects}} were sampled {{to be tested}} for the detection of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, E. coli VTEC and Trichinella spp. For this purpose, diaphragm and skeletal muscles samples were collected after the shooting, and tested at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Lazio and Toscana laboratories, Rome, Italy. Samples were tested respectively by polymerase chain reaction, enzyme linked immunofluorescent assay, microbiological and parasitological assays. The positivity percentages are 3. 6 % for Salmonella spp., 14. 8 % (out of 230 samples tested) for Yersinia enterocolitica, 4. 6 % for E. coli VTEC (vtx 1 and 2 genes). Each positive sample for vtx 1 and 2 was tested to isolate Verotoxigenic E. coli strains; none of them was positive for the same virulence genes. All diaphragm samples were negative to the <b>trichinoscopic</b> <b>test.</b> Every bacterial strain was identified serologically by seroagglutination test...|$|E
40|$|Sera from 14 408 market sows {{from the}} Canadian {{domestic}} swine herd were tested for trichinellosis using an indirect-ELISA as {{a screening test}} and a competitive ELISA for confirmatory testing. Three sera (0. 02 %) gave low level reactions on the competitive ELISA. These reactions were considered nonspecific, and this designation was supported by data from previous and subsequent national surveys, in which serologic, <b>trichinoscopic,</b> and digestion <b>test</b> methodologies was used. This study provides additional evidence that Canada is free of trichinellosis in domestic swine...|$|R
