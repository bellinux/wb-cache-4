25|$|Based on {{research}} performed between 1999 and 2003, Bowen et al. published experiments in 2006 on a magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> (MTJ) endowed with bi-stable spin-dependent states(resistive switching).|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> {{has been}} proposed {{to act as a}} memristor through several potentially complementary mechanisms, both extrinsic (redox reactions, charge trapping/detrapping and electromigration within the barrier) and intrinsic (spin-transfer torque).|$|E
25|$|Between 1934 and 1945, {{a signal}} cabin was located at <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Junction,</b> {{on the eastern}} end of the tunnel, for {{managing}} the transition from the tunnel's single line to the dual lines of the system.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of SIS <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> based on NbN for mixer {{applications in the}} submillimeter range is reported. The unique technological challenges inherent in the {{development of}} all refractory-compound superconductor-based <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> are highlighted.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a review on spin transfer torque in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> In the first part, we propose {{an overview of}} experimental and theoretical studies addressing current-induced magnetization excitations in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> The most significant results are presented and the main observable characteristics are discussed. A description of the mechanism of spin transfer in ferromagnets is finally proposed. In the second part, a quantum description of spin transport in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with amorphous barrier is developed. The role of spin-dependent reflections as well as electron incidence and spin-filtering by the barrier are described. We show that these mechanisms give rise to specific properties of spin transfer in <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions,</b> {{very different from the}} case of metallic spin-valves. In the third part, the theoretical observable features of spin transfer in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> are derived and the validity of these results is discussed and compared to recent experiments. To conclude this chapter, we study the mechanism of spin transfer in half-metallic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions,</b> expected to mimic MgO-based magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report on}} the {{fabrication}} and testing of all-refractory NbN/MgO/NbN SIS (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> for use as high-frequency mixers. Progress {{in the development of}} techniques for the fabrication of submicron-area <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> is described. Junction structures which have been investigated include mesa, crossline, and edge geometries. Using reactive sputtering techniques, NbN <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with critical currents in excess of 104 A/sq cm have been fabricated with Vm values as high as 65 mV and areas down to 0. 1 sq micron. Specific capacitance measurements on NbN/MgO/NbN mesa-type <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> give values in the range 60 - 90 fF/sq micron. These SIS <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> have been integrated with antennas and coupling structures for mixer tests in a waveguide receiver at 207 GHz. Preliminary mixer results are reported...|$|R
25|$|Another idea {{of recent}} {{interest}} is the ferroelectric <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> (FTJ) in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes. The thickness of the ferroelectric layer is small enough to allow tunneling of electrons. The piezoelectric and interface effects {{as well as the}} depolarization ﬁeld may lead to a giant electroresistance (GER) switching effect.|$|E
25|$|The Severn Tunnel, {{completed}} in 1886 by John Hawkshaw {{on behalf of}} the Great Western Railway, lies near the Second Severn Crossing road bridge, and carries the South Wales Main Line section of the Great Western Main Line under the channel. The original line built before the Severn Tunnel was the South Wales Railway from Gloucester, that followed the estuary alongside present day stations of Lydney, Chepstow, Caldicot and Severn <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Junction</b> to Newport.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of intrinsic (spin-transfer torque) and extrinsic (resistive switching) mechanisms naturally {{leads to a}} second-order memristive system described by the state vector x=(x1,x2), where x1 describes the magnetic state of the electrodes and x2 denotes the resistive state of the MgO barrier. In this case the change of x1 is current-controlled (spin torque {{is due to a}} high current density) whereas the change of x2 is voltage-controlled (the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to high electric fields). The presence of both effects in a memristive magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> led {{to the idea of a}} nanoscopic synapse-neuron system.|$|E
40|$|Cryogenic {{detectors}} with superconducting <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> {{can provide}} an energy resolution improved {{by at least one}} order of magnitude compared with standard semiconductor detectors. While the detection principle was already demonstrated many years ago, the past years were dedicated to the transition from the laboratory sample to practical detectors. Our most favored detector design gives rise to <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with electrodes of unequal energy gaps. In such hetero <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> bias conditions can be established which cause a negative signal current. We report the experimental verification of this effect, and we discuss the yield of charge signal of cryogenic detectors based upon superconducting <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of electron tunneling {{has been known}} {{since the advent of}} quantum mechanics, but continues to enrich our understanding of many fi elds of physics, as well as creating sub-fi elds on its own. Spin-dependent tunneling in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> has aroused considerable interest and development. In parallel with this endeavor, recent advances in thin-fi lm ferroelectrics have demonstrated the possibility of achieving stable and switchable ferroelectric polarization in nanometer-thick fi lms. This discovery opened the possibility of using thin-fi lm ferroelectrics as barriers in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions,</b> thus merging the fi elds of magnetism, ferroelectricity, and spin-polarized transport into an exciting and promising area of novel research. Nowadays, this research has become an important constituent of a broader effort in multiferroic materials and heterostructures that involves rich fundamental science and offers a potential for applications in novel multifunctional devices. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review recent developments in ferroelectric and multiferroic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> Starting from the concept of electron tunneling, we fi rst discuss the key properties of magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> and then assess key functional characteristics of ferroelectric and multiferroic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> We discuss the recent demonstrations of giant resistive switching observed in ferroelectric <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> and the new concept of electrically controlling the spin polarization in magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with a ferroelectric tunnel barrier...|$|R
40|$|Non-Ohmic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> are {{believed}} to occur in systems where the exciton and orthogonality catastrophe effects significantly modify tunneling rates. Here we present a simple non-perturbative treatment of the thermodynamic and transport properties of subOhmic and superOhmic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> The large-N approximation demonstrates {{the existence of a}} quantum phase transition in subOhmic but not superOhmic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> In addition, we find a pseudogap which vanishes continuously as the transition is approached.

25|$|Cars {{could also}} be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between Severn <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Junction</b> and Pilning. The {{vehicles}} were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small pannier tank locomotive, although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the steam locomotive tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (£1.50) in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Severn <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Junction</b> {{serves as}} a Park and Ride station for commuters from {{southern}} Monmouthshire to Bristol, Newport and Cardiff {{and there is a}} local action group – the Severn Tunnel Action Group (STAG) – who are campaigning to enhance the Junction's status as a transport hub for the southern Monmouthshire area. As of January 2010, Network Rail have remodelled the tracks around the station, re-opened Platform 4 and modernised the parking and passenger facilities. The junction where the Gloucester to Newport Line joins the South Wales Main Line has been moved west of the station and now joins the main line with high-speed turnouts.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 21st-century {{modernisation}} of the Great Western Main Line, {{the tunnel}} was prepared for electrification. It has good clearances and was relatively easy to electrify, although due to its age, the seepage of water from above in some areas provided an engineering challenge. The options of using either normal tunnel electrification equipment or a covered solid beam technology were considered and {{the decision was made}} to use a solid beam. Over the length of the tunnel, an aluminium conductor rail holds the copper cable, which is not under tension. A six-week closure of the tunnel started on 12 September 2016. During that time, alternative means of travel were either a longer train journey via Gloucester, or a bus service between Severn <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Junction</b> and Bristol Parkway stations. Also during that time, and possibly later, there were direct flights between Cardiff and London City Airport. The tunnel was reopened on 22 October 2016.|$|E
40|$|Using {{magnetron}} sputtering, we {{have prepared}} Co-Fe-B/tunnel barrier/Co-Fe-B magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with <b>tunnel</b> barriers consisting of alumina, magnesia, and magnesia-alumina bilayer systems. The highest tunnel magnetoresistance ratios we found were 73 % for alumina and 323 % for magnesia-based <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> Additionally, <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with a unified layer stack {{were prepared for}} the three different barriers. In these systems, the tunnel magnetoresistance ratios at optimum annealing temperatures {{were found to be}} 65 % for alumina, 173 % for magnesia, and 78 % for the composite tunnel barriers. The similar tunnel magnetoresistance ratios of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> containing alumina provide evidence that coherent tunneling is suppressed by the alumina layer in the composite tunnel barrier.

40|$|Spin filter <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> {{are based}} on {{selective}} tunneling of up and down spin electrons controlled through exchange splitting of the band structure of a ferromagnetic insulator. Therefore, spin filter efficiency can be tuned by adjusting exchange strength of the tunnel barrier. We have observed that magnetic field and bias voltage (current) {{can be used to}} regulate exchange strength and consequently spin-filter efficiency in <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with ferromagnetic DyN and GdN tunnel barrier. In <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with DyN barrier we obtained ∼ 37 % spin polarization of tunneling electrons at 11 K due to a small exchange splitting (E_ex) ≈ 5. 6 meV of the barrier height (Φ _ 0) ≈ 60 meV. Huge spin-filter efficiency ∼ 97 % was found for <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> with GdN barrier due to larger E_ex ≈ 47 meV. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, barrier height can further split due to magnetic field dependent exchange splitting E_ex(H). The spin filter efficiency in DyN <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> can be increased up to ∼ 87 % with magnetic field. Electric and magnetic field tuned spin-filter efficiency of these <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> gives opportunity for practical application of these devices with additional functionality.

2500|$|Chen and Wang, {{researchers}} at disk-drive manufacturer Seagate Technology described three examples of possible magnetic memristors. In one device resistance {{occurs when the}} spin of electrons in {{one section of the}} device points in a different direction from those in another section, creating a [...] "domain wall", a boundary between the two sections. Electrons flowing into the device have a certain spin, which alters the device's magnetization state. Changing the magnetization, in turn, moves the domain wall and changes the resistance. The work's significance led to an interview by IEEE Spectrum. A first experimental proof of the spintronic memristor based on domain wall motion by spin currents in a magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> was given in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Organic and polymer {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) are {{a relatively}} new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction,</b> holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly. OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production. OPV uses [...] "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times". Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%, however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.|$|E
