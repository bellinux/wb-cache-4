25|$|In {{his public}} {{statements}} during the riots, {{civil rights activist}} and Baptist minister Jesse Jackson sympathized with the anger experienced by African-Americans regarding <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> in the King trial, and pointed to certain root causes of the disturbances. Although he suggested that the violence was not justified, he repeatedly emphasized that the riots were an inevitable result of the continuing patterns of racism, police brutality and economic despair suffered by inner-city residents—a tinderbox of seething frustrations which was eventually set off by <b>the</b> <b>verdicts.</b>|$|E
25|$|At 4:58 pm, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley held a {{news conference}} to discuss <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> handed down for the four LAPD police officers. Incensed, his {{statement}} showed both anger toward <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> and made an appeal for calm. Assistant Los Angeles police chief Bob Vernon believed Bradley's opening remarks invited a riot, and were perhaps taken as a signal by some citizens to act in violence. Vernon backed this statement with the assertion that the number of police incidents rose in the hour after the mayor's press conference.|$|E
50|$|Everyone {{involved}} with the case (public prosecutor, lawyers, and the accused) appealed <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> and <b>the</b> case went before the Supreme Court again between 27 March and 31 March 2006. The Supreme Court's 5-judge council had three options {{in regards to the}} district court verdict: upholding <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> modifying <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> or ordering a partial/full re-trial by partially/fully annulling <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> President Bill Clinton {{was briefed}} on {{security}} measures if rioting occurred nationwide due to <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b> An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> announcement.

So much work stopped that <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> cost an estimated $480million in lost productivity.|$|R
50|$|In U.S. legal nomenclature, <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> is <b>the</b> {{finding of}} the jury on the {{questions}} of fact submitted to it. Once the court (the judge) receives <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> <b>the</b> judge enters judgment on <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b> <b>The</b> judgment of the court is the final order in the case. If the defendant is found guilty, he can choose to appeal {{the case to the}} local Court of Appeals.|$|R

25|$|An {{appeal was}} made to the High Court in November 1983. Asked to quash the {{convictions}} {{on the ground that}} <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> were unsafe and unsatisfactory, in February 1984 the court refused the appeal by majority.|$|E

25|$|Much {{like other}} war {{crimes of the}} era, <b>the</b> <b>{{verdicts}}</b> were handed down in verdicts of either guilty or not guilty. In all cases, except for Meyer-Gerhards, the accused received punishment. In many of the cases, the sentences were reduced from their previous issue.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett {{started his}} duties on 9 March at 10:00, and the trials {{concluded}} on 16 March.

Adams read the findings, and adjusted some of <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> for the cadets shown in the next section. The case was closed on 3 May.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>verdict</b> {{was widely}} {{condemned}} and international campaigns and petitions to release her were launched. Halima Abdullahi, director of Help Eliminate Loneliness and Poverty (HELP), a non-governmental organisation, also criticized <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b> In a statement she said <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> was a [...] "thorough embarrassment” {{to the majority}} of Nigerian Muslims. The group argued that the judgment was wrong because Safiya was accused of adultery instead of fornication, since she was a divorcee. Also, the four witnesses stipulated by the Islamic law were not available at the trial. Halima claimed that <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> was passed because Safiya came from an underprivileged class. While describing <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> as “gender discrimination of the highest order,” the group called on Governor Attahiru Bafarawa to intervene to save Safiya’s life.|$|R
50|$|Once {{deliberation}} {{begins the}} jurors {{are allowed to}} talk to each other. They are to remain together, except overnight, until they either reach a decision or determine they cannot reach a decision. In the later occurrence, the jury is said to be deadlocked and is called a hung jury. If the jury decides, this is called <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b> They inform <b>the</b> judge and return to the courtroom where <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> is read. <b>The</b> judge may either accept <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> or overrule it. It is rare for <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> to be overruled. This happens when the judge thinks <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> is unlawful. Often this is because the jury does not follow the legal instructions. It can also happen if the judge thinks the jury interpreted the evidence in a manner that was not legal. Once <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> is determined, <b>the</b> trial moves to the punishment phase. This can simply be the judge issuing the punishment sentence or, in more serious cases, can involve a separate hearing.|$|R
50|$|On October 3, 1995, at 10:00 a.m, {{after four}} hours of deliberation, the jury found Simpson not guilty on both murder counts. News of <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> {{disrupted}} all facets of life and business throughout the United States and abroad, as an estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> announcement. Before <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> was read, President Bill Clinton was briefed on potential security measures, in case rioting occurred following the announcement. The United States Supreme Court received a message documenting <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> during oral arguments, which note the justices passed to each other while listening to the attorney’s presentation.|$|R
25|$|The defendants' cases {{took two}} paths. The defendants' lawyers {{obtained}} reversal of <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> by the Arkansas Supreme Court {{in six of}} the cases: Ed Ware, Will Wordlow, Albert Giles, Joe Fox, Alf Banks Jr., and John Martin (henceforth Ware et al.) due to a defect in {{the wording of the}} jury verdict. The court ruled that the jury had failed to specify whether the defendants were guilty of murder in the first or second degree; those cases were accordingly sent back to the lower court for retrial. They were convicted again, but the state supreme court overturned <b>the</b> <b>verdicts,</b> saying that discrimination against black jurors (the juries were all-white) was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Because the lower court had not acted upon their cases {{for more than two years}} by April 1923, under Arkansas law the defendants were entitled to be released. Jones applied for and gained an order for their release from the Arkansas Supreme Court on June 25, 1923.|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> penalized {{numerous}} clubs, Palermo's {{overall position}} for that season was elevated to 5th, meaning they had {{qualified for the}} 2006–2007 UEFA Cup. In the transfer window, Palermo spent millions adding players to their squad, including Aimo Diana, Mark Bresciano, Fábio Simplício and Amauri, but sold World Cup winner Fabio Grosso to Internazionale. Several football experts and pundits tipped Palermo {{to do well in}} the season ahead, including Alessandro Del Piero.|$|E
25|$|After the interrogations {{the files}} were {{submitted}} to NKVD troikas, which pronounced <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> {{in the absence}} of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in a secluded area run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.|$|E

25|$|On April 29, 1992, {{the seventh}} day of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four {{officers}} of assault and acquitted {{three of the four}} of using excessive force. The jury could not agree on a verdict for the fourth officer charged with using excessive force. <b>The</b> <b>verdicts</b> were based in part on the first three seconds of a blurry, 13-second segment of the videotape that, according to journalist Lou Cannon, was edited out by television news stations in their broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{applicable}} rules of court, {{the time period}} for the Crown to appeal expired 30 days after December 9, when <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> were rendered, while the time period for the defense to appeal expired 30 days after December 11, when Pickton was sentenced. That is why the Crown announced its appeal first, even though the Crown appeal {{is intended to be}} conditional on an appeal by the defence. If the defence had not filed an appeal, then the Crown could have withdrawn its appeal.|$|E
25|$|The nine {{judges of}} the {{military}} tribunal began considering the guilt and sentencing of the co-conspirators on June 29. About an hour was spent considering each defendant's guilt. On June 30, the tribunal began voting on the charges facing each individual. They disposed of the Herold and Atzerodt cases before considering Powell's guilt. He {{was found guilty of}} all charges, except the two counts of conspiracy with Edmund Spangler. The tribunal sentenced Powell to death. President Johnson affirmed <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> and sentences on July 5.|$|E
2500|$|After sentencing, the {{defendants}} decided to appeal <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> of <b>the</b> first trial. The appeal started on 28 September 2010 and concluded on 15 October 2010.

In <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> <b>the</b> {{court found that}} “The Pirate Bay has facilitated illegal file sharing {{in a way that}} results in criminal liability for those who run the service.” [...] Under <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> <b>the</b> sentences of three of {{the defendants}} would be reduced and the total fines would be increased. The fourth defendant, Gottfrid Svartholm, was not present at the time due to medical reasons.

25|$|Mannerheim {{was troubled}} by {{recurring}} health problems during 1945, and was absent on medical leave from his duties as president from November until February 1946. He spent six weeks in Portugal to restore his health. After the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> in the war crimes trials were announced in February, Mannerheim decided to resign. He believed that he had accomplished the duties he had been elected to carry out: The war was ended, the armistice obligations carried out, and the war crimes trial finished.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the presidents were not habitually either magistrates or lawyers, but men clad in sword and cape, caused {{that they did not}} have any vote in court cases, and the court did not submit to their authority, but in {{representation}} that of the king. Thus, the authority of the president, when he was not a magistrate, was void in judicial matter and merely signed <b>the</b> <b>verdicts.</b> The Audiencias chaired by the viceroy were called viceregal Audiencias, and the chaired ones by a governor-captain general were the pretorial Audiencias.|$|E
25|$|Chamlee moved for new {{trials for}} all defendants. Private {{investigations}} took place, revealing that Price and Bates had been prostitutes in Tennessee, who regularly serviced {{both black and}} white clientele. Chamlee offered judge Hawkins affidavits to that effect, but the judge forbade him to read them out loud. The defense argued that this evidence proved that the two women had likely lied at trial. Chamlee pointed to the uproar in Scottsboro that occurred when <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> were reported as further evidence that the change of venue should have been granted.|$|E
500|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> James Kinne's family {{continued}} {{to believe the}} best of their daughter-in-law, telling reporters on the day of <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> [...] "e can't find it in our hearts to say anything bad about her" [...] and [...] "We still don't feel that she committed murder."

50|$|In January 2008, {{the above}} stock-price suit was decided.

The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages. The trial judge vacated <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> and found for the defendants, but the Ninth Circuit reinstated <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b> <b>The</b> U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b> <b>The</b> case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure {{may have been an}} error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.|$|R
