In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the <b>termination</b> <b>box</b> at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E

5000|$|Fittings {{used with}} ADSS cable may be tension type, used at dead-ends where the cable terminates or changes direction, {{or may be}} {{suspension}} type, only holding {{the weight of a}} span with tension transmitted through the next span of cable. Reinforcing rods are used on either side of a support and at dead-ends. Wind-induced aeolian vibration is a factor since ADSS cables have light weight, relatively high tension, and little self-damping. Anti-vibration dampers are installed on each span near the support points. Accessories must not be clamped directly to the cable but instead over reinforcing rods, to protect the cable from electrical and mechanical damage. <b>Termination</b> <b>boxes</b> are used to enclose and protect splices between the ADSS cable and [...] "inside plant" [...] cable runs.|$|R

50|$|Stokab, Stockholm's city-owned network company, is {{the owner}} of one of the largest dark fiber city {{networks}} in Europe. Ribbon cables, new micro cables and blown fiber used by Stokab, are facilitating the installation. New smart network designs, cuts construction costs and eliminates the need to dig up streets and sidewalks to connect building properties one by one. Stokab installs a fibre optic cable from its metro network into the basement of a building where it terminates all the fibres from the street. From the <b>termination</b> <b>box</b> Stokab then installs a multiduct with micro ducts that goes through all the basements on the block to form a ring. Each building has a ‘delivery point’ from which Stokab can connect a micro duct when the building owner wants fibre.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a miniature}} videoprobe system having a probe <b>termination</b> <b>box,</b> a strong back, and a videoprobe housing. The videoprobe system {{is able to}} obtain images from a restricted space at least as small as 0. 125 inches while producing a high quality image. The strong back has a hockey stick shape with the probe <b>termination</b> <b>box</b> connecting {{to the top of}} the handle-like portion of the hockey stick and the videoprobe housing attaching to the opposite end or nose of the hockey stick shape. The videoprobe housing has a roughly arrowhead shape with two thin steel plates sandwiching the internal components there between. The internal components are connected in series to allow for a minor dimension of the videoprobe housing of 0. 110 inches. The internal components include an optics train, a CCD chip, and an electronics package. An electrical signal is transmitted from the electronics package through wiring within an internal channel of the strong back to the probe <b>termination</b> <b>box.</b> The strong back has milled into it multiple internal channels for facilitating the transfer of information, items, or devices between the probe <b>termination</b> <b>box</b> and the videoprobe housing...|$|E

Solar PV panels mounted on high poles also attract lightning strikes, the destructive voltage of which destroys the electronic components. Furthermore, the bypass diodes, which are mounted in the <b>termination</b> <b>box</b> under each panel, may crack under high humidity, heat and short circuits. One of the solutions is to engage trained educated villagers to operate, maintain and manage the solar panels.|$|E
40|$|The series resistance, Rs, of a PV module is {{a factor}} that can {{adversely}} affect its performance. Several physical factors contribute to its value such as the bulk resistance of the semiconductor cell material, the metallic interconnections and the junction <b>box</b> <b>terminations.</b> An accurate determination of Rs enables a quantitative assessment {{of the impact of}} these factors on the module performance for an eventual performance optimization and an estimate of its degradation. There are several experimental methods for determining Rs; the second edition (2009) of the IEC 60891 normative standard provides an iterative calculation procedure based on I-V curves measured at different irradiances. We present a quantitative investigation {{of the impact of the}} standard’s calculation parameters on the overall precision of the Rs calculation. We also analyze the Rs calculation approach of the IEC 60891 first edition (1987), highlighting how this formulation has a strong operator dependence. JRC. F. 8 -Renewable Energy (Ispra...|$|R
40|$|Paleo-climate {{records in}} ice cores {{revealed}} high variability in temperature, atmospheric dust content and carbon dioxide. The longest CO 2 record from the Antarctic ice {{core of the}} Vostok station (Petit et al., 1999) went back in time as far as about 410 kyr BP showing a switch of glacials and interglacials in all those parameters approximately every 100 kyr during the last four glacial cycles with CO 2 varying between 180 - 280 ppmv. New measurements of dust and the isotopic temperature proxy deuterium of the EPICA Dome C (EDC) ice core covered the last 740 kyr, however, revealed glacial cycles of reduced temperature amplitude (EPICA, 2004). These new archives offer the possibility to propose atmospheric CO 2 for the pre-Vostok time span as {{called for in the}} EPICA challenge (Wolff et al., 2004). Here, we contribute to this challenge using a box model of the isotopic carbon cycle (Köhler et al., submitted) based on process understanding previously derived for <b>Termination</b> I. Our <b>Box</b> model of the Isotopic Carbon cYCLE BICYCLE (Fischer et al., 2004; Köhler and Fischer, 2004; Köhler et al.,submitted) consists of ten ocean resvervoir in three high layers distinguishing Atlantic, Indo-Pacific, and Southern Ocean, a seven compartment terrestrial biosphere and considers also fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity between ocean and sediments. BICYCLE is forced by various ice core and marine sediment records to depict observed changes in temperature, sea level, lysocline dynamics, and aeolian iron input into the Southern Ocean. Our results show that major features of the Vostok period are reproduced while prior to Vostok our model predicts significantly smaller amplitudes in CO 2 variations. The main contributions (in decreasing order) to the variations in pCO 2 were given by changes in Southern Ocean vertical mixing, exchange fluxes between ocean and sediment, sea surface temperature, North Atlantic deep water formation, iron fertilisation, and Heinrich events. While most processes were reduced in their magnitude during the terminations of the pre-Vostok period, the absolute contribution of iron fertilisation changed only slightly. Thus, the relative importance of biological and biogeochemical processes is enhanced (approximately doubling their relative share) in the pre-Vostok period. The contribution of physical processes (ocean temperature, sea level, sea ice) to the pCO 2 rise during terminations stayed always below 25 %, while ocean circulation contributed up to 75 % during the Vostok era but less than 50 % before...|$|R
40|$|A {{search of}} {{sequence}} data bases for a tridecamer transcription termination signal, previously described in human mtDNA as {{being responsible for}} the accumulation of mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) in excess {{over the rest of}} mitochondrial genes, has revealed that this termination signal occurs in equivalent positions {{in a wide variety of}} organisms from protozoa to mammals. Due to the compact organization of the mtDNA, the tridecamer motif usually appears as part of the 3 ' adjacent gene sequence. Because in phylogenetically widely separated organisms the mitochondrial genome has experienced many rearrangements, it is interesting that its occurrence near the 3 ' end of the large rRNA is independent of the adjacent gene. The tridecamer sequence has diverged in phylogenetically widely separated organisms. Nevertheless, a well-conserved heptamer [...] TGGCAGA, the mitochondrial rRNA <b>termination</b> <b>box</b> [...] can be defined. Although extending the experimental evidence of its role as a transcription termination signal in humans will be of great interest, its evolutionary conservation strongly suggests that mitochondrial rRNA transcription termination could be a widely conserved mechanism in animals. Furthermore, the conservation of a homologous tridecamer motif in one of the last 3 ' secondary loops of nonmitochondrial 23 S-like rRNAs suggests that the role of the sequence has changed during mitochondrial evolution...|$|E
