5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Service des <b>Travaux</b> Publics carried out random excavations. Father Fancheux and Raymand Surleau, {{who were not}} {{qualified}} archaeologists, carried out the excavations at Arikamedu and sent a few antiquities to Indian museums, and also to the École française d'Extrême-Orient in Hanoi.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{project is}} a {{public-private}} partnership (PPP or P3), designed to transfer the responsibility to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the project to the private sector. Ten banks, BNP Paribas, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, RBS Citizens, N.A., Banco Santander, Bayerische Hypo, Calyon, Dexia, ING Capital, Societe Generale, and WestLB, will provide the senior debt financing for the project, which totals $341.5 million. The project attracted three bidding consortia. Under the concession agreement, FDOT will make milestone payments to the concessionaire (Miami Access Tunnel) during the construction period, upon the achievement of contractual milestones. 90% of Miami Access Tunnel's equity is provided by Meridiam Infrastructure Miami LLC (Luxembourg based Meridiam SARL); the remaining 10% by France's Bouygues <b>Travaux</b> Publics SA, operating as Dragages Concession Florida Inc. The Port of Miami Tunnel Project {{was one of the}} first P3s in Florida, and the first availability-based P3 deal in the US, after the Interstate 595 (I-595) renovation project in Broward County.|$|E

25|$|The French {{government}} has recently selected Eolmed, a consortium led by Quadran {{in association with}} Ideol, Bouygues <b>Travaux</b> Publics and Senvion, a French renewable energy developer, for the development and construction of a 25MW Mediterranean floating offshore wind farm 15km off the coastal town of Gruissan (Languedoc-Roussillon).|$|E

25|$|After retiring, Henin became {{involved}} in two Belgian reality shows in 2009. In May, she starred in De Twaalf Werken van Justine Henin – Les 12 <b>travaux</b> de Justine Henin (The 12 Labors of Justine Henin). The show followed Henin as she completed 12 personal challenges. In June 2009, she hosted a musical TV show that revolved around Belgian-Italian singer Lara Fabian.|$|E
25|$|Navon sat on {{the board}} of directors, which mostly {{consisted}} of French investors. The company raised 14 million francs, of them 9,795,000 francs (390,000 pounds) from Christian religious followers. Construction was carried out by the Parisian Company for Public Works and Construction (Société des <b>Travaux</b> Publiques et Constructions), at a cost of 10 million francs (400,000 pounds), and was to be completed by April 1, 1893. Gerold Eberhard, from Switzerland, was selected to be the chief engineer for the project.|$|E
25|$|Each President of the Fifth Republic {{desired to}} make his mark on Paris, and each {{initiated}} a plan of Grands <b>Travaux</b> ("Great Works"). The first President of the Fifth Republic, Charles De Gaulle, constructed a new central produce market at Rungis to replace the picturesque but antiquated market of Les Halles. But the most visible and appreciated improvement made by de Gaulle was the Malraux Law, drafted by writer and Minister of Culture André Malraux. The façades of the Cathedral of Notre Dame and other landmarks of Paris were cleaned of centuries of soot and grime and returned to their original colours.|$|E
25|$|The {{second phase}} of the centre, located on an {{artificial}} island, was constructed from 1994 to 1997, and features a bird-like rooftop (also referred to as a turtle by some critics). The project took only 48 months from reclamation to completion. The main constructor of the extension was a joint venture named Hip Hing Construction Co Ltd Dragages et <b>Travaux</b> Publics. Originally, Phase Two was connected to Phase One with an atrium link (a sky bridge), and to Convention Road with two road bridges, but now the two phases are connected by an expanded exhibition hall.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{surveyed}} by CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's {{design and construction}} agency, and was approved for construction in August 1931. It was completed {{at a cost of}} 24 million francs by the contractor Générale des <b>Travaux</b> Publics. The petit ouvrage was originally planned as a gros ouvrage with fourteen blocks The project was scaled back, and Block 3 was not connected to the main ouvrage. A second phase was to connect it, and to provide a separate entrance block. Even as a petit ouvrage it mounted the heaviest armament in its sector, with 81mm mortars.|$|E
25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues <b>Travaux</b> Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E

500|$|The {{prefabricated}} steel {{sections that}} would compose the church were manufactured in Binche, Belgium. According to historian Ambeth Ocampo, the knockdown steel parts were ordered from the Societe anonyme des Enterprises de <b>Travaux</b> Publiques in Brussels. In all, [...] of prefabricated steel sections were transported in eight separate shipments from Belgium to the Philippines, the first shipment arriving in 1888. Belgian engineers supervised {{the assembly of}} the church, the first column of which was erected on September 11, 1890. The walls were filled with mixed sand, gravel, and cement. The stained glass windows were imported from the Heinrich Oidtmann Company, a German stained glass firm, while local artisans assisted in applying the finishing touches.|$|E
