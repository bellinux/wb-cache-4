One said that the brute nabbed him in the leg, another saw the vive tongue of it, a third played lick at it with the lantern; this was before they discovered that the dog had been Grizel imitating one, brave Grizel, always ready to protect her mother, and never allowed to cherish the childish fears that were hers by birthright.|$|R

40|$|Friction loss has a {{significant}} impact on the performance of a reciprocating compressor. Piston-cylinder friction is a major contributor compared to the other contributors like <b>thrust</b> bearing, piston <b>pin</b> and crank. In the present work,the piston–cylinder interaction inside a small hermetic compressor is modeled using the Reynolds equation which is solved using finite difference method. The model provides key compressor design parameters such as minimum oil film thickness, oil pressure distribution between piston-cylinder, normal forces and friction power loss. The model is validated against data from published literature. Using the above formulation, different concepts have been studied 2 ̆ 6 compared against their friction loss characteristics. These include variable speed versus variable displacement for capacity control, piston-cylinder clearance for blow-by, cold start (high viscosity oil due to low temperature), lubricating fluids, viz.

60|$|It may {{be noticed}} that times of misrule and {{violence}} seem to create individuals fitted {{to take advantage}} from them, and having a character suited to the seasons which raise them into notice and action; just as a blight on any tree or vegetable calls to life a peculiar insect to feed upon and enjoy the decay which it has produced. A monster like Hopkins could only have existed during the confusion of civil dissension. He was perhaps a native of Manningtree, in Essex; at any rate, he resided there in the year 1644, when an epidemic outcry of witchcraft arose in that town. Upon this occasion he had made himself busy, and, affecting more zeal and knowledge than other men, learned his trade of a witchfinder, as he pretends, from experiment. He was afterwards permitted to perform it as a legal profession, and moved {{from one place to}} another, with an assistant named Sterne, and a female. In his defence against an accusation of fleecing the country, he declares his regular charge was twenty shillings a town, including charges of living and journeying thither and back again with his assistants. He also affirms that he went nowhere unless called and invited. His principal mode of discovery was to strip the accused persons naked, and <b>thrust</b> <b>pins</b> into various parts of their body, to discover the witch's mark, which was supposed to be inflicted by the devil as a sign of his sovereignty, and at which she was also said to suckle her imps. He also practised and stoutly defended the trial by swimming, when the suspected person was wrapped in a sheet, having the great toes and thumbs tied together, and so dragged through a pond or river. If she sank, it was received in favour of the accused; but if the body floated (which must have occurred ten times for once, if it was placed with care {{on the surface of the}} water), the accused was condemned, on the principle of King James, who, in treating of this mode of trial, lays down that, as witches have renounced their baptism, so it is just that the element through which the holy rite is enforced should reject them, which is a figure of speech, and no argument. It was Hopkins's custom to keep the poor wretches waking, in order to prevent them from having encouragement from the devil, and, doubiless, to put infirm, terrified, overwatched persons in the next state to absolute madness; and for the same purpose they were dragged about by their keepers till extreme weariness and the pain of blistered feet might form additional inducements to confession. Hopkins confesses these last practices of keeping the accused persons waking, and forcing them to walk for the same purpose, had been originally used by him. But as his tract is a professed answer to charges of cruelty and oppression, he affirms that both practices were then disused, and that they had not of late been resorted to.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Variscan Belt {{is usually}} {{interpreted}} {{as the result of}} an oceanic subduction followed by continental collision. The subducted ocean is represented by eclogitic lenses enclosed in amphibolite-facies rocks. This rock assemblage, called the Leptyno-Amphibolic Group (LAG), is considered as a suture unit that separates two different continental fragments (Upper Gneiss Unit, UGU and Lower Gneiss Unit, LGU). During the collisional stage, crustal thickening would have led to the emplacement of several synkinematic granites (e. g. Matte, 1986). Such an interpretation has been proposed for the Lévézou area (southern French Massif Central, fig. a) (Nicollet, 1978). The Pinet orthogneiss, initially dated at 360 Ma by lower intercept on zircon fraction (U/Pb, Pin, 1981), is intrusive in both the UGU and the LGU and was considered as a syn-kinematic granite contemporaneous with the Carboniferous <b>thrusting</b> (<b>Pin,</b> 1981; Burg et al. 1984, Burg & Teyssier 1983). Our recent observations show that the deformation pattern of this orthogneiss results from two superimposed deformations (see also Duguet and Faure, 2004) and do not correspond to C-S structures, symptomatic of synkinematic intrusions, as inferred previously (Burg & Teyssier, 1983). Its porphyric character confirms that the Pinet orthogneiss is not a synkinematic intrusion. Geochemical and geochronological analyses of the orthogneisses in both the UGU and the LGU show that they result from the melting of a common source and that they emplaced ca. 470 Ma ago (U/Pb dating on zircon external rims), during the early Ordovician. The geochemical signature of the orthogneisses and the mafic rocks of the LAG show affinities with a magmatic arc and its back arc basin, respectively. In the least deformed orthogneisses, rectangular clusters dominated by phengite, kyanite and garnet suggest a pseudomorphism of former crystals of magmatic cordierite (fig. b). Phase diagrams calculated with THERMOCALC suggest that the pseudomorphs developed in eclogite-facies conditions (ca. 14 - 17 kbar, 650 °C, fig. b). These conditions are similar to those obtained from the eclogite lenses of the neighbouring LAG. Both the orthogneisses and the LAG experienced the same high-pressure event. Preliminary Ar-Ar dating on muscovite grains from both orthogneisses show that the exhumation and deformation took place ca 340 Ma ago. This suggests that Variscan tectonics in the Lévézou area corresponds to the subduction and accretion of a magmatic arc and associated narrow basins rather than a true continental collision. Burg, J.

60|$|Secondly, Mr. Lecky shows {{clearly that}} dogmatic Protestantism, holding the vivid belief in Satanic agency {{to be an}} {{essential}} of piety, would have felt it shame to be a whit behind Catholicism in severity against the devil’s servants. Luther’s sentiment {{was that he would}} not suffer a witch to live (he was not much more merciful to Jews); and, in spite of his fondness for children, believing a certain child to have been begotten by the devil, he recommended the parents to throw it into the river. The torch must be turned on the worst errors of heroic minds—not in irreverent ingratitude, but for the sake of measuring our vast and various debt to all the influences which have concurred, in the intervening ages, to make us recognize as detestable errors the honest convictions of men who, in mere individual capacity and moral force, were very much above us. Again, the Scotch Puritans, during the comparatively short period of their ascendency, surpassed all Christians before them in the elaborate ingenuity of the tortures they applied for the discovery of witchcraft and sorcery, and did their utmost to prove that if Scotch Calvinism was the true religion, the chief “note” of the true religion was cruelty. It is hardly an endurable task to read the story of their doings; thoroughly to imagine them as a past reality is already a sort of torture. One detail is enough, and it is a comparatively mild one. It was the regular profession of men called “prickers” to <b>thrust</b> long <b>pins</b> into the body of a suspected witch in order to detect the insensible spot which was the infallible sign of her guilt. On a superficial view one would be in danger of saying that the main difference between the teachers who sanctioned these things and the much-despised ancestors who offered human victims inside a huge wicker idol, was that they arrived at a more elaborate barbarity by a longer series of dependent propositions. We do not share Mr. Buckle’s opinion that a Scotch minister’s groans were a part of his deliberate plan for keeping the people in a state of terrified subjection; the ministers themselves held the belief they taught, and might well groan over it. What a blessing has a little false logic been to the world! Seeing that men are so slow to question their premises, they must have made each other much more miserable, if pity had not sometimes drawn tender conclusions not warranted by Major and Minor; if there had not been people with an amiable imbecility of reasoning which enabled them at once to cling to hideous beliefs, and to be conscientiously inconsistent with them in their conduct. There is nothing like acute deductive reasoning for keeping a man in the dark: it might be called the technique of the intellect, and the concentration of the mind upon it corresponds to that predominance of technical skill in art which ends in degradation of the artist’s function, unless new inspiration and invention come to guide it.|$|R
