5|$|It was {{designed}} by William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was constructed between 1914 and 1917. The building's style {{is a mix of}} Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, and its development has been particularly influenced by Italian palace design. The building is noted for <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> sculptures that adorn its sides.|$|E
5|$|At {{the east}} end of St George's Chapel is the Lady Chapel, {{originally}} built by Henry III in the 13th century and converted into the Albert Memorial Chapel between 1863–73 by George Gilbert Scott. Built to commemorate the life of Prince Albert, <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> chapel features lavish decoration and works in marble, glass mosaic and bronze by Henri de Triqueti, Susan Durant, Alfred Gilbert and Antonio Salviati. The east door of the chapel, covered in ornamental ironwork, is the original door from 1246.|$|E

5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are {{in stark contrast to the}} often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina, biographer Robert D. Crassweller {{claims that the}} English-speaking nations of North America and Europe largely {{misunderstood}} Argentina's response {{to the death of}} Perón as well as <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> funeral she was granted. Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Peróns and Argentina, saying that the Peróns were of the Hispanic tradition and that their opposition was largely of British ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Other {{artefacts}} in {{the cathedral}} include tapestries in the Chapel of Remembrance from 1976 which record important events {{in the cathedral}}'s history. <b>The</b> <b>ornate</b> pulpit (1710), the largest in Sweden, was designed by Nicodemus Tessin and carved by Burchard Precht. It {{was a gift from}} Queen Hedvig Eleonora after the fire of 1702. Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert, Saint Paul in Athens and the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard.|$|E

5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, the drawing room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. <b>The</b> <b>ornate</b> cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} derives {{its popular}} name from <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> decorations depicting exotic animals and hunting scenes, which were sculpted by Italian architect Emilio Sala since Horodecki {{was an avid}} hunter. The name does not refer to the chimaera of mythology, but to an architectural style known as chimaera decoration in which animal figures are applied as decorative elements to a building. Horodecki unique architectural style earned him praise as the Antoni Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome {{is dark and}} {{cavernous}} and decorated with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E

5|$|The {{illustrations}} and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that {{of other}} Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The site of North {{station has}} {{significantly}} changed. <b>The</b> <b>ornate</b> mausoleum of Sharif Al-Hussein Ben Ali (d.1998) stands directly opposite {{the remains of}} the platform. The operators of the Shia Islamic section of the cemetery have planted Leylandii along the boundary of their section of the cemetery, which includes the platform of North station. Unless the trees are removed, {{the remains of the}} station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. <b>The</b> <b>ornate</b> choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E

5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by indie {{rock bands}} and house music, Graduation marked a {{departure}} away from <b>the</b> <b>ornate,</b> soul-based sound of West's previous releases {{toward a more}} anthemic style of rap music that would function well while he was performing in large arenas. Toward this end, West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling from a wider spectrum of music genres. Lyrically, the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of Graduation towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West's previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).|$|E

5|$|One month into World War II, the Royal Navy {{battleship}} HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German U-boat in Scapa Flow. As {{a result}} barriers were built to close {{most of the}} access channels; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries. The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war, who also constructed <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> Italian Chapel. The Scapa Flow base was run down after the war, eventually closing in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. <b>The</b> <b>ornate</b> finishes of these domes are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because <b>the</b> <b>ornate</b> stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
