25|$|Goatfishes are {{a family}} Mullidae of about 55 species of perciform fishes, {{associated}} worldwide with tropical reefs. They are typically about 20cm long, though the dash-and-dot goatfish, grows to 55cm. Goatfish are tireless benthic feeders, possess {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels ("whiskers") protruding from their chins resembling a goat’s beard. They use these to rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible; worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. Many species of goatfish are conspicuously coloured and have the ability to change their colouration depending on their current activity. By day, many form large inactive (non-feeding) schools: these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin goatfish school with blue-striped snappers. When <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> the yellowfins changes its colouration to match that of the snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. The diurnal goldsaddle goatfish changes from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream when feeding. Other nocturnal feeders will shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for overlooked morsels. Goatfish stay within the shallows, going no deeper than about 110 metres. Most species do not tolerate brackish water, so they do not enter estuaries or the mouths of rivers.|$|E
500|$|There is {{widespread}} {{frustration with the}} land title system. [...] Privatising home ownership {{and the creation of}} a market economy with long term leases is seen by some commentators as the best option to move forward on Palm. [...] This proposal is described as giving Indigenous people [...] "skin in the game" [...] and empowerment. [...] In the period 1999 to 2007 35houses were replaced due to damage. [...] Noel Pearson of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership argues that housing degradation in these communities has more to do with overcrowding and poor construction than it does with poor tenancy. [...] However he adds that Aboriginal people naturally take much better care of property that they have constructed or paid for themselves, than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which has been handed to them 'on a plate' and which they have had little personal engagement in. [...] The push for privatisation of title was led by the Australian Government (through Mal Brough, Indigenous Affairs Minister), Noel Pearson, and some families on the island (the community is very divided on this issue). The proposal had partial (or cautious) support from the then Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition.|$|E

In Ireland, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin reacted to concerns over anti-gay {{comments in the}} media by saying that [...] "anybody who doesn't show love towards {{gay and lesbian people}} is insulting God. They are not just homophobic if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> — they are actually Godophobic because God loves every one of those people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis Maltby, {{founder of}} the National Work Rights Institute, is highly {{critical}} of the decision. He castigated the public-concern requirement as [...] " [...] the Court just made up" [...] in his book Can <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> <b>That?.</b> [...] "Justice White seems to have missed the Catch-22 quality of his rule", he wrote. [...] "You don't need to question management when you agree with them, and you can't question management when you disagree with them because the very act of questioning them could hurt your working relationship." [...] With exceptions like McPherson, he believes this rule has cost too many public employees their jobs. [...] "The sad reality is that freedom of speech is a myth where your employment is concerned, whether you work in the private or the public sector." ...|$|E
2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to us we will have to go on the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barboza has a {{prolific}} and {{wide range of}} both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited {{in public and private}} galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide. [...] He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s – '80s. [...] Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. [...] In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun, he said, [...] "When I do a portrait, I’m doing a photograph of how that person feels to me; how I feel about the person, not how they look. [...] I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. [...] When <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I know I have it." [...] Many of his photographs achieve his signature effect through the careful use of lighting and shadows, manipulation of the backdrop, measured adjustments to shutter speeds, composition, and many other techniques and mediums at his command.|$|E
