50|$|This {{layer of}} {{vegetation}} starts from {{a height of}} about five metres and comprises the top stratum, which consists of phanerophytes. They can be about 45 metres high. The trees (and sometimes shrubs) are of various heights. One tree has its crown {{at the height of}} another’s trunk. At the top the crowns of the different species of trees form a more or less closed canopy. This layer creates special ecological conditions in the underlying layers of forests. The density of the trees determines the amount of light inside the forest. The force of heavy rainfall is reduced by the canopy and the passage of rainwater is fed more slowly downwards. The <b>tree</b> <b>layer</b> can be further subdivided into the upper <b>tree</b> <b>layer</b> or canopy and the lower <b>tree</b> <b>layer</b> or understory.|$|E

Six experimental plots were installed in mixed forest stands with coniferous and beech from Slătioara natural reserve, and the vascular flora was studied on three different layers: trees, seedlings and herbaceous layer. For each layer the species diversity was assessed through Shannon index, and additionally, for trees’ layer, the structural diversity was quantified {{with respect to the}} basal area, using the Gini index. It was observed that among the experimental plots, the Gini index ranges between 0. 65 and 0. 83, corresponding to the uneven-sized balanced structures, and Shannon index computed for species diversity ranges between 0. 66 and 1. 22 for <b>trees</b> <b>layer,</b> between 0. 71 and 1. 38 for seedling and between 1. 12 and 2. 38 for herbaceous layer.

5000|$|A plant {{community}} (sometimes [...] "phytocoenosis" [...] or [...] "phytocenosis") {{is a collection}} or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types. The components of each {{plant community}} are influenced by soil type, topography, climate and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given phytocoenosis. A plant community can be described floristically (the species it contains) and/or physiognomically (its physical structure). For example, a forest (a community of trees) includes the overstory, or upper <b>tree</b> <b>layer</b> of the canopy, {{as well as the}} understory, further subdivided into the shrub layer, herbaceous layer, and sometimes also moss layer. In some cases of complex forests there is also a well-defined lower <b>tree</b> <b>layer.</b> A plant community is similar in concept to a vegetation type, with the former having more of an emphasis on the ecological association of species within it, and the latter on overall appearance by which it is readily recognized by a layperson.|$|E

Primary broadleaved forests occupy a small area in the interfluve between the Vytebet, the Zhizdra and the Oka. Here, the edificatory species are common oak, tillet, taller ash, and elm trees. Unlike the coniferous forests, these are polydominant ones, with 7 to 8 layers. Usually there is birch and aspen in the second layer, with lowland maple, crab apple and field-ash in the third layer. There is also a well-developed layer of shrub. Herbage {{is dominated by}} prevernal ephemeroids and perennials.|$|E

Four line transects were defined. Two were located in holm oak and cork oak “Montado" near Évora and the other in a pineyard located in the Setúbal Peninsula (Apostiça). Several variables were measured to describe the vegetation as a habitat. The linear transect technique was used in the bird sampling. Multivariate statistics were used to analyse the relation between the presence/absence of avian communities and the different vegetation cover measures. These include vegetation vertical structure and percentage of vegetation cover types. The relation between avian diversity and vegetation structure descriptors, as well as the vegetation diversity, was analysed using simple regression methods. The bird communities seem to respond to the above mentioned structural differences.

These authors discuss how future management of this heavily cleared vegetation community can bring it back to a viable state. In 1995 Prober and Thiele examined the effect of grazing, reserve size and tree clearing on the health of these Western slopes Woodlands and found that larger areas supported a greater diversity of species, and thus, healthier communities, than smaller ones and that grazing heavily influenced the health of them. Most remaining areas of remnant Box gum Woodland vegetation were degraded by disturbances like clearing and introduced species and the fragmentation that has occurred by wholesale landscape changes to support farming, in such a rich agricultural area. Reserves, like Livingstone National Park, which have an intact <b>tree</b> <b>layer</b> and understorey or ground layer, with limited disturbance, are not very common.

On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum.
