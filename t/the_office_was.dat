5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (<b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, had survived in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year, <b>The</b> <b>Office</b> <b>was</b> {{nominated}} for several awards, including three Writers Guild of America Award nods.

Novak was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E
5|$|Members are {{assigned}} {{positions in the}} order of precedence, coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> held by a layman who was not necessarily a member of the Order, this precedence has been purely theoretical. As a member of the Order, the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached to the office, and when <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England, the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Ireland's {{second highest}} cleric, the Lord Archbishop of Dublin, {{originally}} {{served as the}} Chancellor of the Order.

5|$|The {{office of}} Governor General was {{abandoned}} in 1669, deemed unnecessary. However, when the Scanian War erupted in 1675, <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> reinstated, and Fabian von Fersen held the office between 1675 and 1677, {{when he died}} in the defence of Malmö.|$|E

5|$|The {{president}} acts as {{the chief}} executive officer and is responsible to the Board of Governors and to the Senate for the supervision of administrative and academic works.

5|$|After Michigan gained statehood, {{governors}} {{held the}} office for a two-year term, until the 1963 Michigan Constitution changed the term to four years. The number of times an individual could hold <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> unlimited until a 1992 constitutional amendment imposed a lifetime term limit of two four-year governorships. The longest-serving governor in Michigan's history was William Milliken, who was promoted from lieutenant governor after Governor George W. Romney resigned, then was elected to three further successive terms.|$|E

5|$|Democrat Joseph A. Scanlon {{was elected}} over Republican Edward W. Furia for clerk of courts, an officer {{charged with the}} {{collection}} and disbursement of payments ordered by the courts. Scanlon, a former state legislator, served as clerk until 1957, {{when he died in}} office. For recorder of deeds, another county administrative office, Democrat Marshall L. Shepard was elected. Shepard was a Baptist minister who had also served as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. Two years later, <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> folded into the city government and converted to a civil service position.|$|E
5|$|From 18211846, the {{district}} attorney would have been appointed; thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> elected. Martindale was {{the district}} attorney of Genesee County from 18421844 and again from 18471849. Thus, Martindale himself filed the complaints in People ex rel. Blacksmith v. Tracy and People ex rel. Waldron v. Soper, and his successor, Seth Wakeman (18501855) filed the complaint in New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble. Although Martindale was district attorney when the complaint in Tracy was filed, he lost the election and attempted to litigate the mandamus issue as a private attorney.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{the court}} {{moved into the}} new Oregon Supreme Court Building, and McNary filed to run for a full six-year term on the bench. At that time <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> partisan, and McNary lost the Republican primary, by a single vote, to Henry L. Benson, after several recounts and the {{discovery}} of uncounted ballots. After his defeat, he served {{the remainder of his}} partial term and left the court in 1915. On July 8, 1916, after a close, multiballot contest, with several contenders, the Republican State Committee elected McNary to be the chair. He was seen as someone who could unify the progressive and conservative wings of the party in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, Garran {{was made}} the first Solicitor-General of Australia (<b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister. The {{creation}} {{of the office and}} Garran's appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, in which Garran gave legal advice to several successive governments, but it also represented a formal delegation of many of the powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 PahWongso {{expanded}} his school in Blandongan {{to include an}} employment office. Established with f.1,000, <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> located above the school and by November 1939 was training 22 job seekers. The Pah Wongso Crèches, meanwhile, served more than 200 ethnic Chinese and indigene students. He continued speaking out against the working conditions in the Indies, giving a lecture to a 1,000-strong audience at the Queens Theatre in Batavia in October 1939. He remained highly popular with the ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of an absence, disability, or other cause {{preventing}} the mayor from performing his duties, the mayor may designate the business administrator or any other department head as acting mayor for up to 60 days. In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and the council has 30 days to name an interim mayor. If no interim mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and selects a new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic succession law. <b>The</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach a decision on appointing an interim mayor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the race}} for city commissioners, each party nominates two {{candidates}} and the top three are elected. <b>The</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was {{the conduct of the}} city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson, a sales executive.|$|E
5|$|Liaquat Ali Khan, {{appointed}} {{as the first}} prime minister by the Governor-General in 1947, was assassinated in 1951. Six further prime ministers served between 1951 and 1958, when <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> dissolved by Iskander Mirza, the President of Pakistan. A later president, Yahya Khan, appointed Nurul Amin as prime minister in 1971, although Amin held the post for only thirteen days. Under the 1973 constitution of Pakistan, the post was recreated and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became prime minister. Bhutto was overthrown by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during Operation Fair Play in 1977, the position was abolished and Zia became Chief Martial Law Administrator. Muhammad Khan Junejo was {{appointed as}} prime minister by Zia in 1985, and subsequently dismissed under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{structure}} of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I, but by the late thirteenth century, it had taken on a distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. <b>The</b> <b>office</b> <b>was</b> merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne.|$|E
