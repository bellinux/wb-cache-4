40|$|We {{examine how}} {{corporate}} liquidity policies of U. S. firms {{vary with the}} source of capital: access <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> or markets. We find that firms with access <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> have lower cash holdings and lower cash flow sensitivity of cash, even after controlling for the endogeneity of firm’s source of capital. A dollar of cash for firms with access <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> is worth $ 0. 16 more for shareholders, compared to a firm with no access <b>to</b> <b>banks.</b> An extra dollar of cash (over and above normal needs) is valued at $ 1. 07 for firms with access <b>to</b> <b>banks.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} source of capital (banks) matters. Banks provide liquidity for satisfying the precautionary motives of firms. At the same time, by virtue of their oversight, they also curb the agency motives of firms...|$|R

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>Bank</b> Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1891 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. The original date specified for completion of construction {{was the end of}} 1896, but the time required to raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year. To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand <b>to</b> <b>Bank.</b> Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E
5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The Parks and Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended <b>to</b> <b>bank</b> episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the state aid {{rules of the}} European Union {{and the application of}} these rules on banks. The primary problem that is addressed is what conditions should be fulfilled in order for state aid <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> <b>to</b> be declared compatible with the Common Market according to article 107 3 FEUF. The thesis addresses all kinds of state aid <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> and these have been divided into the following groups; (i) aid <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> (which are not in financial difficulties), (ii) aid <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> in financial difficulties, and (iii) aid <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> during a system crisis. The application of the state aid rules by the Commission has typically been very formal and there has been incufficient analysis of the actual consequences of aid granted <b>to</b> <b>banks.</b> This thesis is intended to contribute to a more systematic application by the Commission of the state aid rules on banks. Certain conditions must be identified and scrutinized in the application of the state aid rules on banks. Aid measures granted must, in order to be approved, be of public and common interest and the positive effects must be balanced against any negative effects. In order to achieve public and common interest in every individual case, the aid measures granted must be well balanced, necessary and have a stimulative effect. This thesis {{examines the}}se conditions within each category of aid <b>to</b> <b>banks.</b> Finally, I identify compensatory measures that may be well suited for banks. My thesis presents a systematic approach for the application of state aid <b>to</b> <b>banks.</b> In order <b>to</b> this this, I have found it important to describe the meaning of different concepts and conditions. The thesis will contribute to the discussion regarding “less and better targeted aid”...|$|R

5|$|Shepard was {{assigned}} to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, {{and in the meantime}} the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on Franklin D. Roosevelt with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those that were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had <b>to</b> <b>bank</b> sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder is a {{canalisation}} of the River Calder from Wakefield to Castleford, {{where it}} joins the branch from Leeds, which follows the River Aire. The Aire continues to flow eastwards <b>to</b> <b>Bank</b> Dole Junction, then {{continues in a}} north-easterly direction to Haddlesey, from where it follows a winding course to join the River Ouse at Airmyn. The section below Haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation, as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river. Instead, the Selby Canal flows northwards from Haddlesey to the Ouse at Selby. Below Dole Bank Junction, the Knottingley and Goole Canal flows eastards to join the Ouse at Goole. From just before Newbridge, where the modern A614 road crosses the waterway, this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the Dutch River, an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by Cornelius Vermuyden's original diversion of the River Don northwards to the River Aire in 1628.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue <b>to</b> <b>bank,</b> yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E

5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available <b>to</b> <b>Bank</b> Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E
5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club would have to move to a new stadium five miles away in Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time, as, only {{a few days after the}} Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert <b>to</b> <b>Bank</b> Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E
