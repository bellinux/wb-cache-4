40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} hygiene {{practices in}} licensed group {{day care and}} family day care homes and the association between these practices and the prevalence of respiratory illnesses in the children in attendance. METHODS: Self-administered surveys were mailed to 137 group and 204 family day care providers. RESULTS: Wearing diapers and being younger than age three were associated with a higher frequency of respiratory illness. Children attending family day care homes had more respiratory illness than children attending group day care homes. Infrequent washing of children's or providers' hands after nose wiping, after diapering, before meals, and before food preparation {{was significantly associated with}} a higher frequency of respiratory illness. Use <b>of</b> shared cloth <b>towels</b> instead <b>of</b> individual <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> and washing <b>of</b> sleeping mats less than once a week were also associated with a higher frequency of respiratory illness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the importance of handwashing and other hygiene practices in reducing the spread of disease in day care settings...|$|R

40|$|Esta pesquisa teve como objetivos definir o procedimento para o condicionamento fisiológico de sementes de couve-flor e verificar a influência do potencial fisiológico das sementes sobre os resultados desse tratamento. Seis lotes de sementes, três da {{cultivar}} Sharon e três da cultivar Teresópolis Gigante, foram submetidos ao hidrocondicionamento entre camadas de duas, quatro e seis folhas de papel toalha e ao osmocondicionamento entre camadas de quatro folhas de papel toalha umedecidas com solução de polietilenoglicol 6000 (potenciais de - 0, 1 e - 0, 2 MPa). Em todos os procedimentos os teores de água foram ajustados para 32 e 38 %, para a cultivar Sharon, e 34 e 41 % para a cultivar Teresópolis Gigante. Os efeitos dos tratamentos sobre a germinação e emergência das plântulas foram comparados à testemunha (sem condicionamento). O hidrocondicionamento entre quatro e seis folhas, até a obtenção dos teores de água mais elevados, beneficiou a velocidade de germinação (VG) e a de emergência de plântulas (VE), nas duas cultivares. Na cultivar Sharon a VG foi de 14, 6 (testemunha) em comparação a 16, 4 nas sementes hidrocondicionadas, para os lotes de maior e menor potencial fisiológico; paralelamente, os valores da VE aumentaram de 8, 9 para 11, 2 e de 7, 8 para 11, 6, nos lotes de menor potencial fisiológico. Para a cultivar Teresópolis Gigante, a VG e a VE foram favorecidas pelo hidrocondicionamento, independentemente do potencial fisiológico dos lotes (a VG aumentou de 16, 4 para 21, 4 e, a VE, de 9, 5 para 13, 5). Conclui-se que o hidrocondicionamento entre quatro e seis folhas de papel toalha, até a obtenção de teores de água próximos aos da emissão da raiz primária é favorável à velocidade de germinação e de emergência de plântulas em couve-flor e que o potencial fisológico inicial dos lotes pode influenciar a resposta ao condicionamento fisiológico, dependendo da cultivar ou histórico dos lotes. This {{research was}} conducted to define an adequate procedure for cauliflower seed priming and to verify whether the seed physiological potential affects priming results. Six seed lots, three of the cultivar Sharon and three of Teresópolis Gigante, were submitted to hydropriming between two, four and six sheets <b>of</b> <b>towel</b> <b>paper</b> and to osmopriming between four sheets <b>of</b> <b>towel</b> <b>paper</b> moistened with polietilenoglycol 6000 solutions (- 0, 1 and - 0, 2 MPa potentials). In all priming procedures, the seed water content was adjusted to 32 % or 38 % for cv. Sharon and 34 % or 41 %, for cv. Teresópolis Gigante seeds. The effects of treatments on germination and seedling emergence were compared to unprimed control. Results showed that hydropriming between four and six sheets <b>of</b> <b>towel</b> <b>paper</b> was efficient to favor speed of germination (VG) and speed of seedling emergence (VE) in both cultivars when seeds attained 38 % (cultivar Sharon) and 41 % (cultivar Teresópolis Gigante). VG increased from 14, 6 (control) to 16, 4 (hydroprimed seeds) in cv. Sharon seed lots of higher and lower physiological potential; the same for VE that incresead from 8, 9 to 11, 3 and from 7, 8 to 11, 6 in seed lots of lower physiological potential. In seeds of cv. Teresópolis Gigante, hydropriming promoted increases in the VG and VE, independently of seed physiological potencial; VG values ranged from 16, 4 to 21, 4 and the VE from 9, 5 to 13, 5. Results showed that hydropriming between four and six sheets <b>of</b> <b>towel</b> <b>paper,</b> in which seeds attained moisture content close to the required for primary root protrusion is efficient to favor the speed of germination and seedling emergence of cauliflower seeds; the influence of vigor level on seed priming response {{is closely related to}} cultivar and seed lot management.
