50|$|A balloon {{helicopter}} is {{a flying}} toy {{consisting of a}} latex <b>toy</b> <b>balloon</b> <b>and</b> a plastic propeller, derived from the simple balloon rocket. The most important feature is the hollow propeller hub which directs air into a passage in each propeller blade. The air passages channel air to the blade tips such that air escapes in a fine jet tangentially. The air jets on the blade tips causes the entire toy to spin, the blades have a positive angle of attack so the blades experience a lifting force as they push air downwards. It can attain a height of approximately 12 meters (40 feet). Full-scale helicopters have been built around this tip jet configuration.|$|R

The operetta floats along as blithely and it is as pleasing in color as the <b>toy</b> <b>balloon,</b> but it has not its symmetry. In construction the libretto is pitifully crude. There is not a well devised entrance for any one of the characters, and the single attempt at a dramatic situation is made in the third act...The plot is so well hidden that if one attempts to follow it he misses the attractive features of the extraneous detail. There is little food for laughter in the complications of the story as it is set forth, and the only humor to bge detedcted lies in the individual lines...The desert wastes of dialogue were occasionally broken by musical numbers that were, in the main, very pleasing; and the tediousness of the performance was relieved somewhat by the charming spectacle presented by the scenery and costumes." ...|$|R
30|$|Mouthing {{behavior}} in children {{plays an important}} role in their development by filling nutritive needs (e.g. breast or bottle feeding). In addition to nutritive needs children also express non-nutritive needs which involves mouthing objects such as <b>toys,</b> <b>balloons</b> <b>and</b> fabrics, for pleasure and in some cases to overcome the pain and discomfort of teething (Juberg et al. 2001; Tulve et al. 2002). Mouthing behavior of children take many forms such as licking, blowing, chewing, sucking etc. (active mouthing conditions) or using the mouth as a placeholder for objects (passive mouthing conditions) (Steiner et al. 1998). Infants and toddlers tend to mouth objects unintentionally. Constant mouthing of objects brings young children into repeated and frequent contact with the hazardous compounds present in the materials (Fessler and Abrams 2004).|$|R
50|$|Black Grace is {{an internationally}} touring modern dance company, formed in Auckland, New Zealand in 1995. Neil Ieremia, the group's founder and choreographer, draws on Māori and Pacific Islander {{indigenous}} dance, {{as well as}} modern dance and hip hop. Ieremia graduated from the Auckland Performing Arts School and joined the Douglas Wright Dance Company, the leading New Zealand contemporary-dance company at the time. However, the founding members, such as Sam Fuataga and Sean MacDonald, initially had more experience with sports such as rugby, basketball and running than with dance. Performances remain infused with athleticism and may occasionally include a bit of whimsy that is less common in those of other troupes. In Human Language, as the female dancers dance before them, the male dancers inflate <b>toy</b> <b>balloons</b> <b>and</b> look upward in mimicry of courting behavior of certain bird species.|$|R
60|$|Ashe's first {{impression}} of Beach, the butler, {{was one of}} tension. Other people, confronted {{for the first time}} with Beach, had felt the same. He had that strained air of being on the very point of bursting that one sees in bullfrogs <b>and</b> <b>toy</b> <b>balloons.</b> Nervous <b>and</b> imaginative men, meeting Beach, braced themselves involuntarily, stiffening their muscles for the explosion. Those who had the pleasure of more intimate acquaintance with him soon passed this stage, just as people whose homes are on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius become immune to fear of eruptions.|$|R

5000|$|Summoned objects range among animals, weapons, {{forces of}} nature, famous people (both fictional and real), vehicles, {{household}} objects, easter eggs {{of the development}} team, and even internet memes. However, the game does not include trademarked terms, nor potential profanity (summoning [...] "ass" [...] will spawn a donkey; summoning [...] "cock" [...] will spawn a rooster). The game includes a homonym system to offer the player possible choices between similar-sounding objects, such as distinguishing between a <b>toy</b> <b>balloon</b> <b>and</b> a hot-air balloon; {{there is also a}} spellchecker to provide close matches for misspelled words. The North American release includes support for other languages including Brazilian Portuguese, French, and Spanish, with French-Canadian and Latin American variants available for words in the French and Spanish language sets, respectively. The UK version also accounts for difference between American and British English, such as the differing meanings of the word [...] "football". [...] 5th Cell has stated that the limit to what objects may be summoned is up to the player's imagination. Players, using special software, claimed to have discovered that the full list of words is greater than 22,800 unique entries, but, in response, Slaczka said there were many more than this number.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{perceptions}} of children in preschool education with regard to the value of affection in the pictures they draw. The study involved 199 children aged 60 months old or above. The descriptive research method was used and data were collected with the draw-and-explain technique. During the collection of the data, the children were requested to draw a picture related to the value of affection and explain the picture they drew. The children’s explanations were recorded by the researcher. The study is one of the first to be conducted in Turkey with preschoolers in this research area. The results showed that the children generally depicted human figures like family members, other children and friends, animals like butterflies and dogs, trees, flowers and grass, happy images such as hearts, <b>balloons</b> <b>and</b> <b>balls,</b> <b>and</b> abiotic images like clouds and sunshine, as well as other images like houses in their drawings.
