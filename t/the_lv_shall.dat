50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> {{begins to}} {{contract}} and develop pressure, blood is still entering <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> from <b>the</b> aorta (since aortic pressure {{is higher than}} LV pressure), implying {{that there is no}} true isovolumic contraction. Once <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> pressure exceeds <b>the</b> aortic diastolic pressure, <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> begins to eject blood into the aorta.|$|R
50|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> {{contracted}} with <b>the</b> CNJ for rights from Roselle to Jersey City, but <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> eventually finished {{construction of the}} line to its terminal in Jersey City over the Newark and Roselle Railway, the Newark and Passaic Railway, the Jersey City, Newark, and Western Railway, and the Jersey City Terminal Railway. <b>The</b> <b>LV's</b> Newark and Roselle Railway in 1891 brought the line from Roselle into Newark, where passengers connected to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Bridging Newark Bay proved difficult. <b>The</b> <b>LV</b> first attempted to obtain a right of way at Greenville, but the Pennsylvania Railroad checkmated them by purchasing most of the properties needed. Then the CNJ opposed <b>the</b> <b>LV's</b> attempt to cross its line at Caven Point. Finally after settling the legal issues, the Newark Bay was bridged in 1892 by the Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway and connected to the National Docks Railway, which was partly owned by <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> and which reached <b>the</b> <b>LV's</b> terminal.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{penetration}} of distributed {{renewable energy sources}} such as PV may lead to voltage rise in <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> distribution networks.

Equipping a distribution transformer with On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC), can also solve the overvoltage problem in <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> network. A challenge for the OLTC control is to deal with different voltage profiles of downstream lines of <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> network.

40|$|Unlike {{systolic}} {{heart failure}} (HF), HF with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFNEF) is charac-terized by a normal LV systolic function often {{evaluated by the}} biplane Simpson method. 1 However, {{recent studies have shown}} that, despite a normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF), patients with HFNEF have a significant impairment of the longitudinal systolic function of <b>the</b> <b>LV,</b> suggesting that in these patients the myocardial systolic function of <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> is not preserved. 2 – 5 Furthermore, several investigations have high-lighted the key role of the longitudinal diastolic dysfunction of <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> in <b>the</b> pathophysiology of HFNEF. 6 – 8 Nonetheless, despite these studies, 2 – 8 whether a longitudinal systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction is associated with an impairment of the global function or myocardial performance of <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> in patients with HFNEF remains poorly understood.

We implement a deformable model to track <b>the</b> <b>LV</b> motion, utilizing Finite Element Methods (FEM) to keep the general shape and topology of <b>the</b> <b>LV.</b> This volumetric deformable model speeds up the FEM and facilitates the medical analysis. <b>The</b> <b>LV</b> motion reconstruction provides information for further analysis of cardiac mechanisms. ...|$|R
