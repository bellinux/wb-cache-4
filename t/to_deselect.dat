5|$|Bessie's {{increasingly}} centrist stance troubled {{party members}} in Liverpool Exchange, where the Bevanite faction was generally popular. In 1954 the local party passed a motion requesting that she step down {{before the next}} general election. This {{was rejected by the}} NEC, who believed that Bessie was a national electoral asset. Shortly before the May 1955 general election the Exchange party tried again, and voted by 40 to 39 <b>to</b> <b>deselect</b> her. Bessie, convinced that this vote had been rigged, appealed to the NEC, who set the decision aside and imposed her on the constituency. These party machinations had no effect on Bessie's popularity with the voters; in the election on 26May, despite the intervention of a left-wing Independent Socialist candidate, she increased her majority to 7,186. Nevertheless, nationally the Conservatives retained power with an increased parliamentary majority. In the municipal elections held that same month, Labour won control of Liverpool's council for the first time; Jack Braddock became council leader. Bessie gave up her St Anne's ward seat, after 25 years, but remained on the council as a co-opted alderman.|$|E

2500|$|Pay for {{performance}} programs often target patients with serious and complex illnesses; such patients commonly interact with multiple healthcare providers and facilities. However, pilot programs now underway focus on simple indicators such as improvement in lab values {{or use of}} emergency services, avoiding areas of complexity such as multiple complications or several treating specialists. A 2007 study analyzing Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare visits showed that a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists provide care for a single patient. The authors doubt that pay-for-performance systems can accurately attribute responsibility for the outcome of care for such patients. The American College of Physicians Ethics has stated concerns about using a limited set of clinical practice parameters to assess quality, [...] "especially if payment for good performance is grafted onto the current payment system, which does not reward robust comprehensive care...The elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions is especially vulnerable to this unwanted effect of powerful incentives." [...] Present pay-for-performance systems measure good performance based on specified clinical measurements, such as glycohemoglobin for diabetic patients. Healthcare providers who are monitored by such limited criteria have a powerful incentive <b>to</b> <b>deselect</b> (dismiss or refuse to accept) patients whose outcome measures fall below the quality standard and therefore worsen the provider's assessment. Patients with low health literacy, inadequate financial resources to afford expensive medications or treatments, and ethnic groups traditionally subject to healthcare inequities may also be deselected by providers seeking improved performance measures.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the prime}} {{differences}} between Lasso and ridge regression is that in ridge regression, as the penalty is increased, all parameters are reduced while still remaining non-zero, while in Lasso, increasing the penalty will cause {{more and more of}} the parameters to be driven to zero.

Thus, Lasso automatically selects more relevant features and discards the others, whereas Ridge regression never fully discards any features.

40|$|Previous {{findings}} suggest that children’s cross-ethnic friendships are less stable than same-ethnic friendships. However, {{it is not clear}} why this is. This study examined stability of same- and cross-ethnic friendships among 10 -year-old children over the course of five months. Analyses focused on both individual-level data (comparing 82 German and 37 Turkish children) and social network data (comparing 125 German and 172 non-German children). We predicted that children high in empathy and who perceived peer norms about cross-ethnic friendships to be positive would have more stable cross-ethnic friendships. Results showed that cross-ethnic friendships were indeed less stable than same-ethnic friendships. Empathy marginally predicted stability of cross-ethnic friendships while peer norms only predicted German but not Turkish children’s cross-ethnic friendship stability. Further, children high in empathy were less likely <b>to</b> be <b>deselected</b> by their cross-ethnic friends and similarity in empathy between cross-ethnic friends increased the longevity of their friendship...|$|R
5000|$|As news volumes {{continued}} to increase, {{it became apparent}} that even KILL files could not possibly keep up with the sheer number of users and articles. A new concept, the threaded newsreader, was needed as users gradually switched from a [...] "read most, kill few" [...] model to [...] "ignore most, read few". By organizing the articles in a newsgroup according to threads of discussion, using headers that had long been present in Usenet articles but practically unused, a threaded newsreader would allow users to keep up with topics and discussions they were interested without having <b>to</b> explicitly <b>deselect</b> uninteresting threads. Kim F. Storm's nn newsreader was the first to implement this new model, and it looked for a while as if nn would do to rn what rn did to readnews.

As the company's owner, Mr. Guzzler, is a fundamentalist Christian, Alan decides to win him over by getting Norma to pose as a prostitute and seduce the lecherous Secretary of State for Wales, which Alan will then photograph. The scheme succeeds, but ends with the Secretary's death, as he suffers a fatal heart attack when he learns that Norma is a transsexual. After pausing to persuade Roland to sell him his unprofitable sheep ranch, one of the largest in the country and the only one in Haltemprice, Alan takes a meeting with Mr. Guzzler and his wife at one of their restaurants. As Sarah refuses to help him with his scheme, he gets Norma to pose as his wife. At the meeting, the Guzzlers invite Alan and his [...] "wife" [...] to join them in a swinger party to seal the deal, Alan is naturally forced to refuse. This turns out to be the right move, as Mr. Guzzler reveals that he was just testing Alan's moral fortitude, and he passed. Alan is ecstatic; he can't wait to tell Roland, to tell him both that he has just brought a major new business to the constituency and to let him know that Alan's sheep ranch is about to be very profitable indeed.|$|R

While progress {{in this area}} is underway in sensor technology, mobile computing platforms, and data transport, barriers to large scale application remain ahead, particularly in the area of patient disease diagnosis, which generally requires a diverse set of sensors and instruments that are applied at proper times in response to patient state/behavior.

Within the application you have a general overview of the excavation seen from above and you can view the 3 D models in the same spot where they were originally found: together with them you can see a brief historical description that contextualizes the object.

The essay also aims to examine the expectations that parents have in the schools, {{as well as the}} pros and cons as they consider private school compared to other schools. My study is based on qualitative data collected through interviews with parents who have chosen to place one or more of their children in a specific Christian private school.

40|$|The Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) {{has opened}} new doors as an {{emerging}} technology with high potential to replace traditional CMOS-based memory technology. This has come true {{due to the}} density, speed and non- volatility that have been demonstrated. The STT-MRAM uses Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) elements as non-volatile memory storage devices because of the recent discovery of spin-torque phenomenon for switching the magnetization states. The magnetization of the free layer in STT-MRAM can be switched from logic 2 ̆ 212 ̆ 2 to logic 2 ̆ 202 ̆ 2 {{by the use of}} a spin-transfer torque. However, the STT-MRAMs have till now only been used as universal memory. As a result, STT-MRAMs are not yet commercially used as computing elements, though they have the potential to be used as Logic-In-Memory computation applications. In order to advance this STT-MRAM technology for computation, we have used different MRAM devices that are available as memory elements with different geometries, to use it as computing elements. This dissertation presents design and implementation of such devices using different multilayer magnetic material stacks for computation. Currently, the design of STT-MRAMs is limited to only memory architectures, and there have been no proposals on the viability of STT-MRAMs as computational devices. In the present work, we have developed a design, which could be implemented for universal logic computation. We have utilized the majority gate architecture, which uses the magneto-static interaction between the freelayers of the multilayer nanomagnets, to perform computation. Furthermore, the present work demonstrates the study of dipolar interaction between nanomagnetic disks, where we observed multiple magnetization states for a nanomagnetic disk with respect to its interaction energy with its neighboring nanomagnets. This was achieved by implementing a single layer nanomagnetic disk with critical dimension selected from the phase plot of single domain state (SDS) and vortex state (VS). In addition, we found that when the interaction energy between the nanomagnetic disks with critical dimension decreases (increase in center-to-center distance) the magnetization state of the nanomagnetic disks changes from single domain state to vortex state within the same dimension. We were able to observe this effect due to interaction between the neighboring nanomagnets. Finally, we have presented the design and implementation of a Spin-Torque driven Re- configurable Array of Nanomagnets (STRAN) that could perform Boolean and non-Boolean computation. The nanomagnets are located at every intersection of a very large crossbar array structure. We have placed these nanomagnets {{in such a way that}} the ferromagnetic free layers couple with each other. The reconfigurable array design consists of an in-plane (IP) free layer and a fixed polarizer [magnetized out-of-plane (OP) ]. The cells that need <b>to</b> be <b>deselected</b> from the array are taken to a non-computing oscillating state...|$|R
