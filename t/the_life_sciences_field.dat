40|$|G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{are a major}} {{family of}} {{membrane}} receptors in eukaryotic cells. They {{play a crucial role}} in the communication of a cell with the environment. Ligands bind to GPCRs on the outside of the cell, activating them by causing a conformational change, and allowing them to bind to G-proteins. Through their interaction with G-proteins, several effector molecules are activated leading to many kinds of cellular and physiological responses. The great importance of GPCRs and their corresponding signal transduction pathways is indicated by the fact that they take part in many diverse disease processes and that a large part of efforts towards drug development today is focused on them. We present Human-gpDB, a database which currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-proteins and 99 human effectors. The collection of information about the interactions between these molecules was done manually and the current version of Human-gpDB holds information for about 1663 connections between GPCRs and G-proteins and 1618 connections between G-proteins and effectors.

"May 2011 "This paper provides empirical evidence related to the factors which allow SBIR winner firms to be more innovative. The analysis is carried out by investigating the influence of firm-specific characteristics, together with regional-specific characteristics, on the cumulative number of patents awarded by SBIR to <b>life</b> <b>science</b> firms from 1983 to 2006. Based on a dataset of SBIR winners that operate in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>science</b> <b>field,</b> <b>the</b> data were analyzed under a fitted Poisson count data model with an estimated marginal effect for each of the continuous explanatory variables. We find evidence that larger and older firms are more prolific in generating more patents.

Additionally, the idea of positive effects arising from spatial collocation with successful firms is supported from the significance influence that the number of firms located within a 20 -mile radius from a given firm has on patent production. Finally, the econometric analysis also shows that firms that employ knowledge bases close to their core science are more abundant in producing patents, which highlights the economic significance of the type of external knowledge sourced by a particular firm...|$|R
40|$|Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) is a soft {{ionisation}} based Mass Spectrometry (MS) technology suitable for application on large biomolecules. It {{has emerged in}} the late of 80 s as techniques for the ionisation of large proteins (Tanaka et al. 1988). The 2002 Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded to Koichi Tanaka {{for the use of}} MALDI-TOF with biological macromolecules. This technique has been experimentally used for discriminating microorganisms based upon chemical compositional information alone, or by the use of multiple characters (the polyphasic approach). MALDI-TOF for the identification and classification of microorganisms needs statistical tools to enable comparisons of the unknown biomarkers with reference molecular masses. Ribosomal proteins are used normally as reference molecular masses as they are conserved and abundant biomarkers in the cells. Recent studies using MALDI-TOF for rapid and reliable microbial identification, show considerable promise (Santos et al. 2010; Rodrigues et al. 2011; Passarini et al. 2013; Nicolau et al. 2014; Pereira et al. 2014). Furthermore, the technique is rapid, reliable and inexpensive in terms of labour and consumables when compared with other biological techniques. The full impact of this approach has been now appreciated once more diverse species have been studied in detail. Currently, based on the acquired knowledge of MALDI-TOF application on the microbial identification, it is a sound technique that adds an additional step for polyphasic microbial identification. MALDI-TOF is essential when there is a paucity of characters for defining many species. Nevertheless, even with the best polyphasic system, identification of some microbial taxa remains time-consuming and determining what represents a species remains subjective. This communication will focus on the nuances of the application of MALDI-TOF MS for the microbial identification. Potentialities and applications of the technique from the chemical to <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> <b>fields</b> with particular attention to the microbial identification and microbial proteomics will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical {{information}} contained in text repositories (e. g. Medline) represents {{the vast majority of}} genomic information accumulated through years. Methods to transform unstructured text into structured information are necessary to provide access to these resources. Regularities in structured data can then be discovered by means of data mining techniques. Transforming unstructured text into structured information means transforming texts into structured objects described on the basis of discrete data (e. g. words denoting biomedical entities such as genes, disease names) characterized by one or more attributes and eventually by relations between data (e. g. words denoting relations between genes and drug reactions or diseases). Entity and relation extraction is generally performed by using Information Extraction techniques which allow to analyze natural language texts at different levels of complexity in order to extract features on entities and relations. Obtained features may express statistical (e. g. word frequency), lexical (e. g. alphanumeric, capitalized word), structural (e. g. the order of sentences in a text and of entities in a sentence), syntactical (e. g. singular/plural proper/not proper nouns, base/conjugated verbs) or domain­ specific knowledge (e. g. an entity belonging to a dictionary). Biomedical entities can also be described in terms of specialized taxonomies available in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>science</b> <b>field</b> (e. g. GeneOntology, MeSH, UMLS). Association rule mining on biomedical literature exploiting the MeSH taxonomy to discover associations between entities at different level of abstraction has been already investigated. While previous works ignore information on relations among objects, we propose to exploit object interactions by resorting to a first ­order formalism and a multi­relational approach to association rule mining. In this case, the mining process is able to extract association rules involving objects and relations at different levels of granularity with respect to a hierarchy defined on objects of interest...|$|R

40|$|Diacylglycerol (DAG) -like lipases {{are found}} to play an {{important}} role in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> and industrial <b>fields.</b> A putative DAG-like lipase (MgMDL 2) from Malassezia globosa was cloned and expressed in recombinant Pichia pastoris. The recombinant MgMDL 2 was expressed as a glycosylated protein and purified into homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography. The activity of recombinant MgMDL 2 was optimal at 15 °C and pH 6. 0, and it keeps over 50 % of relative activity at 5 °C, suggesting that MgMDL 2 was a cold active lipase. MgMDL 2 retained over 80 % of initial activity after incubation at 30 and 40 °C for 2. 5 h, but it was not stable at 50 °C. Incubation of methanol and ethanol at a concentration of 30 % for 2 h did not affect the recombinant enzyme activity, while metal ions, including Ca 2 +, Mn 2 + and Ni 2 +, sharply inhibited the MgMDL 2 activity at 5 mM by 42 %, 35 % and 36 %, respectively. MgMDL 2 exhibited a preference for medium chain-length esters with highest activity toward p-nitrophenyl caprylate, while it was active on mono- and diacylglycerol but not on triacylglycerol, indicating that it was a typical DAG-like lipase. By homology modeling, Phe 278 was predicted to be involved in the preference of MgMDL 2 for monoacyl- and diacyl-glyceride substrates, but not triglycerides...|$|R
