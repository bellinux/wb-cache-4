500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail.

He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here <b>tonight,</b> <b>I</b> was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

President Obama recalled the victims of the September 11 attacks. He praised the nearly ten-year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the Taliban government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam and defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. [...] "To those families who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda's terror," [...] he said, [...] "justice has been done." [...] This remark book-ended President Bush's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that [...] "justice will be done." ...|$|E

The song has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning" [...] dubstep composition. It {{begins with the}} sound of acoustic guitar reminiscent of Avicii's single [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] (2012), as Madonna coos in the background, [...] "You're gonna love this", but quickly transitions into what critic Sasha Geffen calls [...] "past stadium-filling EDM" [...] and into [...] "a genre that more commonly fills the headphones of kids surfing obscure music blogs late at night. It sounds a little like vaporwave". The track deviates from a traditional song structure and hook, instead featuring harsh cuts, synths and Madonna singing in a nasal tone. Minaj raps in the track, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like, [...] "I just wanna have fun <b>tonight,</b> <b>I</b> wanna blow up this house tonight", [...] "alternating between pitch-shifted shrieks of 'Who do you think you are??' and the sing-songy title taunt."

500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner <b>tonight</b> <b>I</b> see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E

Almost 80,000 {{members of the audience}} chanted [...] "Shady!" [...] for five minutes until Eminem returned to perform an encore with [...] "Lose Yourself". Before performing [...] "Not Afraid", Eminem told the audience, [...] "All jokes aside... Thank you for sticking by me and not giving up on me." [...] At one point during the show, he told them, [...] "Everybody here <b>tonight,</b> <b>I</b> just wanna say thank you for sticking by me and not giving up on me." [...] News sources praised the performance; James Montgomery of MTV News wrote, [...] "what stood out the most about Em's performance was the sheer tenacity with which he attacked it."

500|$|Chicago Sun-Times praised West's vocal delivery, saying [...] "he rips more hard raps on 'Devil in a New Dress' -- chuckling through lines like, 'We love Jesus / but {{you done}} {{learned a lot}} from Satan / We ain't married / but <b>tonight</b> <b>I</b> need some consummation,' and later chewing through an {{impersonation}} of a preacher, 'Say-tan! Say-tan! Say-tan!'—all over a fluttery, high, quiet-storm soul vocal that's part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer." [...] MTV stated [...] "West's breezy GOOD Fridays release gets a wintertime tune-up with Ross riding shotgun. The Miami Don's majestic contribution comes with a revamped breakdown setting up his slick boats. Still, Yeezy's verse holds up over the Boss's even with the refinement." [...] Dan Vidal of URB stated Ross brought his best to the track, writing that he [...] "steps his tired old coke-rhymes up to intense lyrical portraits on the final version of 'Devil In A New Dress'." [...] Stereogum's Amrit Singh described the production style as a throwback to vintage hip-hop beats, and praised West's extended use of metaphors on the track. AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer cited the track as an example of West's [...] "penchant for soul", calling the track excellent. AllMusic's Andy Kellman also described the beat as a [...] "throwback soul production", writing that it was [...] "provided by the Smokey Robinson-sampling Bink, it’s as gorgeous as any of West’s own early work, yet it’s marred by an aimless instrumental stretch, roughly 90 seconds in length, that involves some incongruent electric guitar flame-out." ...|$|E
500|$|The fifth song, [...] "Illuminati", was {{inspired}} after Madonna learnt {{that she was}} considered {{as one of the}} Illuminati's members. She decided to research about the real Illuminati and then wrote the song. Lyrically it refers to the Illuminati conspiracy theory, the Egyptian pyramids, the Phoenix, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Eye of Providence among others, with the chorus lyrics: [...] "It's like everybody in this party is shining like Illuminati". According to Madonna, Kanye West, who produced the track, loved the melody and changed the composition adding his own spin to it. Minaj appears on the sixth track, [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where she raps, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like: [...] "I just want to have fun <b>tonight,</b> <b>I</b> wanna blow up this house tonight". Produced by Diplo and Sophie, the track has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning dubstep" [...] composition. During the writing sessions, Minaj had to rewrite the lyrics until she could get the correct sentiment Madonna wanted. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] consists of an [...] "arresting" [...] chorus and a drum beat sound, described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as: [...] "innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a gospelized stomp". Track eight, [...] "Joan of Arc", is a ballad in which Madonna sings about the media scrutiny of her life, singing: [...] "Each time they take a photograph, I lose a part of me I can't get back". It also references the Roman Catholic saint of the same name. Madonna's hushed, vibrato-tinged vocals, and confessional lyrics in [...] "Joan of Arc", are enhanced by a new beat instrumentation that utilizes strings and acoustic guitars in the bridge.|$|E
