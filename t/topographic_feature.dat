5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a <b>topographic</b> <b>feature</b> that {{separates}} Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Toponymic {{surnames}} (nazwisko odmiejscowe) usually {{derive from}} {{the name of a}} village or town, or the name of a <b>topographic</b> <b>feature.</b> These names are almost always of the adjectival form. Originally they referred to the village owner (lord). In the 19th century, however, surnames were often taken from the name of a person's town.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} <b>topographic</b> <b>feature</b> is the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a low plateau {{that breaks}} up the Sierra Madre chain between the Sierra Madre del Sur {{to the north}} and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas to the south. At its highest point, the Isthmus is 224m (735ft) above mean sea level. This area also represents the shortest distance between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean in Mexico. The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200km (120mi). Although the northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered with dense jungle, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most level point within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.|$|E
500|$|The {{topography}} of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis. Its most visible <b>topographic</b> <b>feature</b> is the giant far-side South Pole–Aitken basin, some [...] in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System. At [...] deep, its floor {{is the lowest}} point {{on the surface of}} the Moon. The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin. Other large impact basins, such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale, also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims. The far side of the lunar surface is on average about [...] higher than that of the near side.|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} names for this <b>topographic</b> <b>feature.</b> The Metacomet Ridge is {{described}} by some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, Massachusetts, and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden, Connecticut. A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield, Massachusetts, to Long Island Sound. The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as [...] "The Traprock Ridge". Geologically and visually, the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous landscape feature from Belchertown, Massachusetts, to Branford, Connecticut at Long Island Sound, a distance of , {{broken only by the}} river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts. [...] Until January 2008, the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) did not recognize Metacomet Ridge, Traprock Ridge or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified. Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as [...] "the traprock ridge" [...] or [...] "the traprock mountains" [...] or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms. Further complicating the matter is the fact that traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three–fourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part {{of the structure of the}} ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another [...] through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border. This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, 75 {{percent of}} the world {{population}} does not have access to formal land administration systems, which are able to register and safeguard their land rights. There is an urgent need for sustainable and affordable systems, which are able to secure land rights for all people, in all places, at all time. The cadastral map, which shows land parcels and their boundaries, {{in one of the most}} important components of land administration. This research is proposing to construct a cadastral map, according to the general boundary concept, with the use of airborne laser scanning. For this, a workflow is developed. General boundaries are coinciding with <b>topographic</b> <b>features,</b> which can be detected in point clouds. The general boundaries can be used to determine land parcels and subsequently land rights of people can be linked to the land parcels. Attention is paid to <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> which often serve as general boundaries and to a suitable point cloud density for detecting particular <b>topographic</b> <b>features.</b> This MSc thesis has demonstrated that airborne laser scanning is suitable for deriving a large share of <b>topographic</b> <b>features,</b> which may serve as general boundary. However, it is necessary to know on forehand, which <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> in a particular area of country are general boundaries. If this is known, the required point cloud density and the type of analysis can be determined...|$|R
30|$|Historically, most sedimentological and geomorphological {{studies of}} subaqueous beds have {{considered}} beds in which sand covered the entire substrate, i.e., sediment beds. It {{is known that}} on starved beds (nonerodible substrates with sparse sand), there occur <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> that {{are different from those}} that occur on sediment beds, for example, sand patches. For starved beds, the relation between the sand flux and the <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> has not been sufficiently studied. Although Betat et al. (2002) measured the bedload flux for sediment beds, there are few such studies, because it is difficult to measure the sand flux without disturbing the system; {{this is especially true for}} starved beds. Numerical simulations can provide useful information about the generation and transition of sand <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> on starved beds, such as sand patches.|$|R

It is suggested that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as [...] An alternative, pseudo-etymological suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternate spelling of the Spanish word , which means [...] "the jewel".

40|$|Pelagic fishes are {{typically}} considered mobile and wide-ranging open ocean foragers. However, many species {{have also been}} recorded in association with nearshore topographic structures. The relative abundance of four pelagic species at and away from <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> on the continental shelf, as inferred from fine-scale catch data collected over a 7 -year period, was examined for southern Western Australia. A total of 1056 captures were recorded from 890 h of trolling over 102 days: the top four species accounted for 97. 5 % of all captures. Eight distinct <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> received 13. 7 % of the total trolling effort and produced 43. 8 % of captures. The percentage of all captures within 1 km of these features were 80 % for yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi, YTK), 50 % for bonito (Sarda australia, BON), 27 % for southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii, SBT), and less than 5 % for skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis, SKJ). Catch rates were 26, 6. 59, and 2. 47 times higher than catch rates away from the <b>topographic</b> <b>features</b> for YTK, BON, and SBT, respectively. In contrast, SKJ catch rates were 1 / 3 rd lower at <b>topographic</b> <b>features,</b> indicating avoidance rather than preference. The mean distance at which species were captured {{from the center of}} each feature differed significantly, with YTK closest (303 m), followed by SBT (442 m), BON (493 m), and SKJ (539 m).
