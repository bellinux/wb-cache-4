500|$|In a 2012 interview, Katamsi {{admitted}} {{the film was}} in part overacted {{and that it had}} been a potent way to spread and indoctrinate viewers in the New Order's ideology. The Tempo survey suggested that it was effective propaganda, leading viewers to [...] "reject all <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> the PKI and communism". Although it is no longer broadcast on 30 September, the film remains available. A video CD edition was released by Virgo in 2001 and the G30S/PKI museum at Lubang Buaya offers regular screenings in an on-site cinema.

2500|$|In the novel's {{account of}} the civil war and {{subsequent}} peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of García Márquez's earlier works, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba. In the novel's final chapter, García Márquez refers to the novel Hopscotch (Spanish: Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar in the following line: [...] "...in the room <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die" [...] (p.412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in Hopscotch who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: The Death of Artemio Cruz (Spanish: La Muerte de Artemio Cruz) by Carlos Fuentes and Explosion in a Cathedral (Spanish: El siglo de las luces) by Alejo Carpentier.|$|E

60|$|I {{gathered}} {{instead the}} primroses, <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> earth {{and of the}} weather. There were no snowdrops. I had found the day before a bank of crocuses, pale, fragile, lilac-coloured flowers with dark veins, pricking up keenly like myriad little lilac-coloured flames among the grass, under the olive trees.

6000|$|She {{could see}} him talking to her father, and taking out a wisp of a {{handkerchief}} <b>that</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> cyclamen, {{she had a good}} scrub round.
