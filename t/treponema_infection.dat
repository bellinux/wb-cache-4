40|$|We {{examined}} 19 patients (17 men) {{with human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gastrointestinal symptoms to determine whether those symptoms were due to either a gastrointestinal tract infection or a defect in mucosal absorption because of an enteropathy. The erythrocyte folate and serum vitamin B 12 levels were within normal limits {{in all of the}} patients. The serum ferritin level was elevated in 12. The xylose absorption test results were abnormal in 8 of the 13 patients able to complete the study. None of the duodenal aspirates yielded a pathogen. Light microscopy revealed nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation without infection in the stomach (in seven patients), the esophagus (in five), the duodenum (in two) and the rectum (in two). However, biopsy specimens were positive for Candida albicans in the esophagus (four patients), cytomegalovirus in the esophagus (one) and the rectum (two), Helicobacter pylori in the antrum (two), <b>Treponema</b> <b>infection</b> in the rectum (two) and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in the small intestine (one). Only three patients had a normal series of biopsy specimens. All of the patients had similar ultrastructural changes at the epithelial-stromal junction of the antral glands and in the intestinal crypts. We conclude that abnormal biochemical and endoscopic findings are common in HIV-positive patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Defects in carbohydrate absorption and ultrastructural changes may be responsible for some aspects of HIV enteropathy...|$|E

30|$|Given {{their high}} {{intermittent}} mobility, proximity to cattle {{as well as}} underlying cultural practices, pastoralists are among groups with high exposure to infectious diseases. Living under adverse environmental conditions while in search for pasture can result in malaria and other environmental pathogenic diseases. Proximity to cattle and consumption of raw untreated milk from cows result in <b>Treponema</b> <b>infections</b> and bovine TB. Furthermore, widespread practice of polygamous relations {{increases the risk of}} sexually transmitted infections. Compounded with this, especially in humanitarian crisis settings with weaker health systems, pregnant pastoralists are under-served resulting in an escalation of the impact of infectious diseases which affects pregnant women and their developing foetus via vertical transmission. Using South Sudan as a case study, this paper argues that it is essential to control infectious diseases among pregnant pastoralists, through exploring various ambulatory health services especially mobile clinics.

40|$|The {{ability of}} macrophages to process and present treponemal antigens to T-lymphocytes was studied in {{early stages of}} {{experimental}} syphilis produced by Treponema pallidum Bosnia A strain (the causative agent of endemic syphilis) infection of inbred Syrian hamsters (LSH/Ss Lak strain). A difference was noticed in the response of macrophages obtained from the peritoneal cavity, lymph nodes, and spleens of the infected animals. In all of these locations, a general increase in the population of Iak-positive macrophage was seen during the entire period of infection, i. e., 3 to 18 weeks after inoculation. Peritoneal cavity-derived macrophages showed no difference in antigen presentation to sensitized and nonsensitized T-lymphocytes for the first 7 weeks of infection. However, at 18 weeks after infection, peritoneal macrophages lost their ability to process treponema antigens. Spleen- and lymph node-derived macrophages did not exhibit a parallel loss {{in their ability to}} process treponema antigens. A fluctuation without a consistent pattern was noticed in the antigen processing and presentation by macrophages from the spleen and lymph nodes. In general, the sensitized T-lymphocytes responded to treponema antigen presented by macrophages more vigorously than the nonsensitized T-lymphocytes. An increased ability of spleen-derived macrophages to process and present antigens was noticed throughout the entire period of infection. The macrophages from the lymph nodes showed such an increase only temporarily at 3 weeks after infection. These data suggest that the processing and presentation of treponema antigens by macrophages in acute syphilitic infection fluctuates considerably and depends on the source of macrophages and the duration of the infection. The differences in the response of peritoneal cavity-, spleen-, and lymph node-derived macrophages probably reflect the complex interactions between the macrophage and other cells involved in the immune response to <b>treponema</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E

30|$|Regarding the South Sudanese health system, {{although}} the Ministry {{has adopted a}} primary health approach, there are prevailing challenges of health financing, limited staff versus high demand for health services, poor infrastructure and general functioning of health services. In addition, there is generally lower utilisation of health services by pastoralists due to their seasonal movements (El Shiekh and van der Kwaak 2015). This irregular movement pattern affects their use of health services as they move nearer or {{farther away from the}} existing limited health services. Movement of pastoralists in South Sudan, just as those in many places of the world, is determined by water and pasture (Mugo et al. 2015). For those who are pregnant, this irregular movement has several implications which affect their health and overall well-being. First, proximity to the livestock during these movements increases risk of transmission of some infectious and zoonotic diseases such as <b>Treponema</b> <b>infections,</b> diarrhoea and malaria. Second, dietary practices such as consumption of raw untreated milk and meat from livestock during these movements could increase the risk of brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis (TB) (Dyson-Hudson and Dyson-Hudson 1980). Polygamous sexual relations/marriages among pastoralists increase the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. In fact, according to the South Sudan Ministry of Health, the highest incidences of HIV are found at Kapoeta State which is largely dominated by pastoralists and semi-pastoralists (Leslie and Fry 1989). In our multi-sector evaluation to understand pastoralists’ fabric of life in Kapoeta, we found that men had an average of four wives (Montavon et al. 2013). These marital practices vis-à-vis low ANC attendance could increase risk of HIV vertical transmission from mother to child.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Congenital {{syphilis}} (CS) {{can occur}} when a mother is inadequately treated or not treated {{at all for}} an active <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection.</b> Symptoms of CS are often subtle and non-specific, and {{it is estimated that}} up to 60 % of affected infants are asymptomatic at birth, making the diagnosis dependent on laboratory findings. Despite decades of experience with CS, problems still arise in its diagnosis because laboratory test results for children at risk for CS can be inconclusive and no single diagnostic test can be used to diagnose CS. The development of diagnostic tests such as enzyme immunoassays, immunoblotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has increased the sensi-tivity and specificity of diagnoses, but the detection of specific IgM is currently the most sensitive serological method, and the presence of specific IgM should be considered as evidence of a congenital T. pallidum infection.

We present a 31 -year-old woman with neurosyphilis. Atthe beginning the patient was treated with erythromycin, and twelvemonths later, because of insufficient decrease of titre of syphilis tests inthe serum, with doxycycline. Despite the second therapy the titres ofsyphilis tests remained high and therefore after another nine monthsthe patient was referred to our department for further diagnostics andtreatment. Because of the long course of the disease, high titres ofsyphilis tests in the serum and abnormalities in neurological examination(hypoaesthesia below the Th 8 level, foot clonus and hyporeflexiain lower extremities) T. pallidum neuroinfection was suspected andcerebrospinal fluid was collected.

In this prospective study the change in case definition and treatment of congenital syphilis, as well as the addition of a third VDRL to a pregnant woman at her admission to hospital, allowed to improve the detection of congenital syphilis cases to improve, specially in the group of mothers who were infected at the third trimester of pregnancy or close to delivery. In a five-year period (1994 - 1999) 191 newborn infants of VDRL (+) mothers were studied in the nursery and their clinical and serological (VDRL and FTA-ABS) follow-up was conducted during 15 months. Congenital syphilis was documented in 6 / 6 cases of the presumptive congenital symptomatic syphilis group and in 3 / 24 cases (12, 5 %) in the asymptomatic presumptive syphilis group. No cases were detected in asymptomatic newborn children whose mother had received opportune and adequate syphilis treatment during gestation. Decisions made based on epidemiologic, serologic and clinical records of the mother and her newborn child, are a valid choice to identify those children who are at greater risk of <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection.</b> This is while there is no specific and sensitive routine diagnostic test available to discard the illness in asymptomatic newborn children, especially when {{it is not possible to}} assure a long term follow up...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in São Paulo, Brazil, to compare azithromycin with thiamphenicol for the single-dose treatment of chancroid. In all, 54 men with chancroid were tested. The etiology was determined by clinical characterization and direct bacterioscopy with Gram staining. None of the patients had positive serology or dark-field examination indicating active <b>infection</b> with <b>Treponema</b> pallidum. Genital <b>infections</b> due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and herpes simplex virus were excluded by polymerase chain reaction testing. For 54 patients with chancroid, cure rates with single-dose treatment were 73 % with azithromycin and 89 % with thiamphenicol. HIV seropositivity was found to be associated with treatment failure (p= 0. 001). The treatment failed in all HIV positive patients treated with azithromycin (p= 0. 002) and this drug should be avoided in these co-infected patients. In the view of the authors, thiamphenicol is the most indicated single-dose regimen for chancroid treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the preparation {{and preservation of}} human amniotic membrane required for transplantation {{in the management of}} ocular surface diseases. Informed consent is obtained and the donor is screened to exclude risk of transmissible infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infections.</b> Ideally, the media and washing solutions needed for the preparation of amniotic membrane are prepared only a week to 10 days prior to use and not stored in the freezer weeks ahead. The AM obtained under sterile conditions after elective caesarian section is washed free of blood clots and chorion. With the epithelial surface up, amniotic membrane is spread uniformly without folds or tears on individually sterilized 0. 22 &#x 0026;# 956;m nitrocellulose membranes of the required sizes. The prepared filter membrane with the adherent amniotic membrane is placed in the preservative medium and stored at - 80 &#x 00 B 0;C. The membranes are released when the repeat serology for HIV after the window period has excluded virus infection in the donor. Depending on consumption they may be used up to 6 months after preparation, though many have recommended storage for an indefinite period. Since the amniotic membrane has only incomplete expression of HLA antigens and amniotic epithelial cells do not express them, it is not rejected after transplantation. The presence of several cytokines in the amniotic membrane promotes epithelialization with reduction of fibrosis during healing...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection</b> evokes {{vigorous}} immune responses, {{resulting in}} tissue damage. Several {{studies have demonstrated}} that IL- 17 may be involved in the pathogenesis of syphilis. However, the role of Th 17 response in neurosyphilis remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, Th 17 in peripheral blood from 103 neurosyphilis patients, 69 syphilis patients without neurological involvement, and 70 healthy donors were analyzed by flow cytometry. The level of IL- 17 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was quantified by ELISA. One-year follow up for 44 neurosyphilis patients was further monitored to investigate the role of Th 17 /IL- 17 in neurosyphilis. We found that the frequency of Th 17 cells was significantly increased in peripheral blood of patients with neurosyphilis, in comparison to healthy donors. IL- 17 in CSF were detected from 55. 3 % neurosyphilis patients (in average of 2. 29 (0 – 59. 83) pg/ml), especially in those with symptomatic neurosyphilis (61. 9 %). CSF IL- 17 was predominantly derived from Th 17 cells in neurosyphilis patients. Levels of IL- 17 in CSF of neurosyphilis patients were positively associated with total CSF protein levels and CSF VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) titers. Notably, neurosyphilis patients with undetectable CSF IL- 17 were more likely to confer to CSF VDRL negative after treatment. Conclusions: These findings indicate that Th 17 response may be involved in central nervous system damage and associated with clinical symptoms in neurosyphilis patients. Th 17 /IL- 17 may be used as an alternative surrogate marker for assessin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Every year, {{millions}} of people are exposed to avoidable, life-threatening risks through the transfusion of unsafe blood. Aim: To determine the sero-prevalence of Syphilis among pre-transfused blood in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin-City, Nigeria. Material and Methods: The detection of Treponema pallidum IgG/IgM was based on the principle of double antigen sandwich immunoassay, in which purified recombinant antigens are employed sufficiently to identify antibodies to Syphilis. The outcomes of interest included the proportion of Syphilis positive units of pre-transfused donor blood, the source of blood and the total number of units of blood processed in the hospital blood bank. Results: Two hundred proportionally selected commercial and targeted donors’ blood samples were screened for Treponema pallidum, and 8 % (n = 16) were found to be positive (95 % confidence intervals 9. 21 - 22. 79). Syphilis seropositivity was found to be significantly higher in commercial donors (p< 0. 05). The likely risk of iatrogenic transfusion related <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection</b> was estimated to be 384 cases/ year at the present rate of utilization of donor blood at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital. Conclusion: There is a risk of iatrogenic transfusion-transmitted Treponema pallidum in the study hospital. There is, therefore, a need for screening blood donors for circulating antibodies to syphilis infection and other transfusion transmissible infections prior to allogeneic transfusion both in Nigeria and the world over, which may help in avoiding transfusion related Syphilis and its probable long-term effects. Blood that is positive for Syphilis should be discarded, and the affected donor treated appropriately...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection</b> and {{the synthesis of}} proteoglycans by organ cultures of rabbit testes was investigated. Two proteoglycan fractions, large (CL- 6 B Kav 0. 05) and small (Kav 0. 25), that were not synthesized at detectable levels by cultures from rabbits infected with T. pallidum for 0 or 5 days, were produced by cultures from 10 -, 15 - and 20 -day infected rabbits. The small proteoglycan appeared to be synthesized first because greater amounts of this fraction were detected in extracts of cultures from 10 -day infected animals. The large proteoglycan fraction may have been induced directly by T. pallidum because increased synthesis correlated with maximal treponemal numbers, 15 days after infection. In contrast, the induction of the smaller proteoglycan {{did not appear to}} be directly related to numbers of elutable organisms. The proteoglycans synthesized between 10 and 20 days after infection were analyzed for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) size and composition. The size of GAGs beta-eliminated from the proteoglycans generally increased over the 10 - 20 -day infection period. Whereas the composition of the small proteoglycan fraction was largely unchanged during the 10 - 20 -day period (45 % chondroitin sulphate (CS), 55 % dermatan sulphate (DS)), the amount of DS in the high molecular weight proteoglycan fraction decreased from 50 - 20 % during this period (CS 50 - 80 %). Autoradiography studies revealed that increased proteoglycan synthesis in T. pallidum-infected testes was localized to cells lining the seminiferous tubules and to fibroblasts infiltrating peritubular spaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of early syphilis currently requires dark-field microscopic or serologic demonstration of <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection.</b> Dark-field microscopy is not widely available and {{is complicated by}} the numerous saprophytic spirochetes which are present at oral and rectal mucosal surfaces. Serologic tests are positive in only 70 to 90 % of patients with primary syphilis, and several days may be required for results to become available. We used a pathogen-specific, fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody to examine lesion exudates from 61 patients for the presence of T. pallidum and compared the data with results of dark-field microscopy and serologic testing. The direct fluorescent-antibody technique revealed the presence of T. pallidum in 30 of 30 patients with early syphilis, and dark-field microscopy was positive for 29. Serologic tests were reactive for 27 of 30 patients with syphilis; in the 3 patients with nonreactive serologic tests, chancres had been present for 4, 6, and 21 days. Although 7 of 31 patients without syphilis had spiral organisms seen on dark-field microscopy, the direct fluorescent-antibody test was negative for all 31. The presence of nonpathogenic spirochetes was subsequently verified in 5 of 7 patients by using a second monoclonal antibody which reacts with nonpathogenic, as well as pathogenic, treponemes and related spirochetes. The demonstration of T. pallidum by using fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies is intrinsically specific and is as sensitive as dark-field microscopy for the {{diagnosis of}} early syphilis. This method provides a convenient, accurate means for the diagnosis of syphilis by health care providers, many of whom lack access to dark-field microscopy...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundStudies on sexually {{transmitted}} infections in Brazil are done mainly in large metropolises and screening {{is available for}} pregnant women only. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and risk factors for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and <b>Treponema</b> pallidum <b>infection</b> among young non-pregnant women in non-clinical settings in middle-sized cities of Central Brazil. MethodsA cross-sectional community-based sample of 1072 participants was included. Sexually active women (64. 9 %) provided first-catch urine samples for PCR investigation of chlamydial and gonococcal infection. Syphilis was tested in serum. Univariate analysis investigated risk factors for chlamydial infection. Multivariate logistic regression included associations with a p-value < 0. 20. ResultsThe mean age of participants was 18 years; 73. 2 % reported unprotected intercourse, 37. 6 % were married/cohabiting, and 5 % reported a previous STI. Prevalence rates of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. pallidum were 9. 6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 4 – 12. 4 %), 0. 7 % (95 % CI 0. 2 – 1. 9 %), and 0. 15 % (95 % CI 0. 0 – 0. 7 %), respectively. After adjustments, being < 20 years old (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1. 90, 95 % CI 1. 07 – 3. 37) and having three or more lifetime sexual partners (aOR 2. 57, 95 % CI 1. 46 – 4. 53) {{were associated with the}} risk for chlamydial infection. ConclusionsWe observed a high prevalence of chlamydial infection and sexual risk behaviors in this population. These findings are important to guide screening strategies in Brazil...|$|R
