40|$|UnrestrictedIn modern {{reservoir}} management, optimizing {{the recovery}} efficiency of displacement processes {{is a fundamental}} problem with important economic ramifications. Given a well configuration, the optimum displacement efficiency may be achievable through controlling injection rates. Smart wells and intelligent completion have gained significant attention {{in recent years in}} the field of dynamic optimization of Enhanced Oil Recovery processes.; The specific question we address is how to partition the flow rate within the well, so that the displacement front can be steered according to pre-determined dynamics, or as is necessary. The ability to steer a front at will is of obvious significance. Given the reservoir geology, one can for example, steer the front away from flow obstacles, affect a piston-like displacement in heterogeneous formations or otherwise control the displacement process as needed.; The objective of this thesis is to investigate the steering of the front by partitioning the injection rates along the well. First, the problem is addressed in a simple rectangular geometry based on potential flow. It is assumed that the flow is potential and that the displacement is at a unit mobility ratio. These assumptions are for mathematical convenience only and can be relaxed. They allow, however, significant insight into the problem. When the reservoir is homogeneous and isotropic, an integral equation in an analytical form is derived, the solution of which determines the desired injection rate profile. A similar approach applies for an anisotropic or a heterogeneous system, except that the kernel in the integral equation must be determined numerically. This is done either by repeated calculations of the Green’s function in a heterogeneous system or for a modified <b>two</b> <b>well</b> <b>system.</b> For the solution of the integral (Fredholm) equation, a regularization technique is necessary. However, it is found that numerical instabilities do develop, even with the use of regularization, for later times, when transverse cross-flow is large. Conversely, the instabilities diminish with a more stratified structure. The application of the technique is highlighted and extended to heterogeneous systems where itscomplexity and the solution were studied. Also in a forward displacement problem, the effect of rate fluctuations on the front dynamics were analyzed in a semi-infinite porous media. We considered the special case of injection rate with one harmonic term. It was found that the front is less sensitive to the fluctuations in rate for larger harmonic terms.; The results of this study find applications to the rapidly emerging field of smart wells and the optimization of displacement problems in oil reservoirs using flow rate control...|$|E

One, ethyl β-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (β-CCE), was extracted from human urine and {{may be related to}} an endogenous ligand for the BDZ, receptor. It reverses the effects of BDZs in vivo and in vitro, but also has intrinsic activity, as it loweres the seizure threshold to drugs antagonistic to the action of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

40|$|Motivation: Many {{problems}} in biomedicine {{and other areas}} of the life sciences can be characterized as control problems, with the goal of finding strategies to change a disease or otherwise undesirable state of a biological system into another, more desirable, state through an intervention, such as a drug or other therapeutic treatment. The identification of such strategies is typically based on a mathematical model of the process to be altered through targeted control inputs. This paper focuses on processes at the molecular level that determine the state of an individual cell, involving signaling or gene regulation. The mathematical model type considered is that of Boolean networks. The potential control targets can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can be manipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. Experimentally, node manipulation requires technology to completely repress or fully activate a particular gene product while edge manipulations only require a drug that inactivates the interaction between two gene products. Results: This paper presents a method for the identification of potential intervention targets in Boolean molecular network models using algebraic techniques. The approach exploits an algebraic representation of Boolean networks to encode the control candidates in the network wiring diagram as the solutions of a system of polynomials equations, and then uses computational algebra techniques to find such controllers. The control methods in this paper are validated through the identification of combinatorial interventions in the signaling pathways of previously reported control targets in <b>two</b> <b>well</b> studied <b>systems,</b> a p 53 -mdm 2 network and a blood T cell lymphocyte granular leukemia survival signaling network.

The rising use of stainless steel, aluminum and magnesium causes new requirements for coatings e. g. on pressing tools because the potential of conventional hard coatings to reduce cold welding is limited in these cases. At the Same time there is a cleas demand to reduce or eliminate the use of lubricants and separation agents.

Nevertheless, compased to the high hardness, wear resistance and excellent friction properties, {{in many cases the}} life time of a-C:H films is relatively insufficient.

Two different production configurations were tested: (1) a vertical <b>well</b> <b>system</b> with a vertical injector and three vertical producers and (2) a vertical injector-smart horizontal <b>well</b> <b>system</b> that consisted of a vertical injector and a smart horizontal producer divided into three sections. Runs were conducted using pure steam injection and steam-propane injection in the <b>two</b> <b>well</b> configurations. Experimental results indicated the following. First, for the vertical configuration, the addition of propane accelerated oil production by 53 % and increased ultimate recovery by an additional 7 % of the original oil in place when compared to pure steam injection. Second, the implementation of the smart horizontal system increased ultimate oil recovery when compared to the recovery obtained by employing the conventional vertical <b>well</b> <b>system</b> (49 % versus 42 % of the OOIP) ...|$|R
