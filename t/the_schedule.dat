50|$|In fact, {{a part of}} {{the reason}} why atrocities are {{committed}} is economic activity. In my experience, I have seen that in some areas, <b>the</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Caste or <b>the</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Tribe person is prosperous. My knowledge is mostly about <b>the</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Caste, not about <b>the</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Tribe. It is because of the economic activity, because of the enterprise, there are areas where <b>the</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Caste people have also become prosperous. <b>The</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Caste people are able to build brick and stone houses. <b>The</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Caste people are able to acquire vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>Scheduled</b> Caste people are able to dress better, send their children to better schools. One of the reasons why atrocities take place in those places is to cripple them economically. Every riot, every arson case cripples them economically. Therefore, it is important that the State must immediately rush in social and economic measures for the rehabilitation of those who have suffered through these atrocities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a SOAP request scheduling algorithm for differentiated quality of service. <b>The</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm can be deployed on a Web services server or any server that processes SOAP requests. Due to the resource-intensive security processing of SOAP messages, this research implements <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm on a QoS security server. <b>The</b> security server <b>schedules</b> <b>the</b> requests forwarded from the Web services server {{for the security}} processing and then sends the valid requests back to the Web services server for executing the Web services. The design of <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm {{is derived from the}} traditional deficit round-robin <b>scheduling.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm schedules requests according to the probed CPU resource consumption of requests. In <b>the</b> evaluation, <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm reveals <b>the</b> service differentiation on the throughput and response time and <b>the</b> little <b>scheduling</b> overhead. <b>The</b> resource utilizations are measured to prove the security processing is much more resource-intensive than the Web services execution. ...|$|R

Generating an optimal schedule of tasks for an application is critical for obtaining high performance in a heterogeneous computing environment {{and it is a}} hard problem.
