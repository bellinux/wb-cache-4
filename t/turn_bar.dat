5000|$|Larger {{cam-operated}} {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called automatic chucking lathes, automatic lathes, automatic chuckers, automatics, or chuckers. The [...] "chucker" [...] {{part of the}} name {{comes from the fact}} that the workpieces are usually discrete blanks, held in a bin called a [...] "magazine", and each one takes a turn at being chucked (gripped by the machine for being worked on) and cut. (This is analogous to the way that each round of ammunition in the magazine of a semi-automatic pistol gets its turn at being chambered.) The blanks are either individual forgings or castings, or they are pre-sawed pieces of billet. However, some members of this family of machine tools <b>turn</b> <b>bar</b> work or work on centers (for example, the Fay automatic lathe). Regarding bar work of large diameter (for example, 150 mm or more), it is merely an academic point whether it is called [...] "screw machine work" [...] or just [...] "automatic work".|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{different}} cutting speeds on cutting tool wear and surface roughness was investigated in <b>turning</b> operation. Cylindrical <b>bars</b> of AISI 1040 steel was selected as workpiece materials during this investigations in turning process. The K type coated CVD(Chemical Vapor Deposition) TiAlN ceramic tungsten carbide cutting tools were used in <b>turning</b> of <b>bars.</b> Surface roughness of <b>turned</b> <b>bars</b> and tool wear were accepted as criteria for performance evaluation of these cutters. Tool wear was determined by performing SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analyses after conducting other experimental studies at a constant feed rate. Surface roughness values were also measured after every turning process. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of cutting speed, especially low cutting speed on tool wear and surface roughness. According to experimental results, decreasing of cutting speed forces the cutting tool more and increasing of cutting speed not only causes more coating wear, but also increase radius of cutting nose. However, the best surface roughness could be obtained in turning process for max cutting speed...|$|R

50|$|Polygonally {{turned parts}} may have several points, teeth, {{or other forms}} at the ends or along their circumference. The {{technique}} requires synchronisation of {{the movement of the}} polygonal turning mill and the part being machined. Polygonal turning allows rapid production and clean machining of advanced geometries. The polygon turning unit has a multitude of inserts, and is synchronized so that when an insert cuts the <b>turning</b> <b>bar</b> stock, it cuts the bar at the same radial position each time the workpiece rotates. This enables geometries such as hexes, squares and flats to be machined at faster speeds than by milling.|$|R
