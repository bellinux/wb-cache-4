5|$|The upper {{compound}} (A) is {{the oldest}} part of the fortress. It includes the citadel (tower 1) and the Serbian Orthodox chapel (tower 4). Although it remains uncertain, the chapel has led many <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> section was built by a Serbian noble.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> impeded easy {{recognition of a}} card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed {{that they will be}} printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E

Ramesh Chandra Majumdar states <b>that</b> <b>this</b> account is doubtful because it was written centuries after the alleged persecution, {{and that it is}} [...] "unsafe to accept the statements recorded in this book as historical". Radhagovinda Basak states that there is no reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> 12th century Buddhist author had cherished any ill feeling about Shashanka, and he may have had reasons to describe the events as they occurred in the 7th century.|$|R

5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
25|$|The Thera eruption, {{dated to}} the seventeenth or sixteenth century BC, caused a large tsunami that some experts hypothesize devastated the Minoan civilization {{on the nearby}} island of Crete, further leading some <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{may have been the}} {{catastrophe}} that inspired the story.|$|E
25|$|D.sect. Diplophragma {{was defined}} as {{containing}} a single species, D.bipinnatifida (now Banksia bipinnatifida), which Brown thought contained two seed separators.

25|$|In {{the medieval}} era some within the Christian {{community}} came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> line referred to Christians worshipping Jesus; they demanded {{that it be}} excised.

25|$|A white berried {{sport of}} Pinot noir was {{propagated}} in 1936 by Henri Gouges of Burgundy, {{and there is}} now 2.5ha planted of this grape which Clive Coates calls Pinot Gouges, and others call Pinot Musigny. There is however no published evidence, nor any obvious reason, <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is other than a (possibly quite fine) form of Pinot blanc, having simply arisen as a selected natural mutation of the original Pinot noir in the Gouges' vineyard.|$|E

25|$|LaRouche was {{particularly}} critical of Britain {{and of the}} Tavistock Institute in London, a psychotherapy and social-sciences charity that the movement associated with British intelligence. In 1999 a LaRouche publication said Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was threatening to assassinate LaRouche, probably with backing from the royal household. Duggan's family came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> worldview affected the movement's perception of Duggan, when the conference participants learned {{that he was a}} British Jew who, as a child, had attended the Tavistock Clinic for counselling when his parents divorced.|$|E
25|$|Such {{individuals}} and groups make the general argument that the Catholic Church's line on homosexuality emphasises the physical dimension of the act {{at the expense of}} higher moral, personal and spiritual goals. Gay and lesbian Catholics also feel that the practice of total, life-long sexual denial risks personal isolation. John J. McNeill writes that since gay people experience their sexual orientation as innately created, to believe that it is therefore a tendency towards evil would require believing in a sadistic God; and that it is preferable <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> element of Church teaching is mistaken in arguing that God would behave in such a way.|$|E
25|$|After {{lobbying}} by Churchill, who was keen {{to bring}} the Channel Ports under British control, and by Wilson, French lobbied Joffre (27 September) for the BEF, which was less heavily gunned and more mobile than a similarly-sized French Army, to disengage and try to move around the Allied left flank, part of the outflanking movements known as the Race to the Sea. Joffre agreed in principle, although he had private doubts about having no French troops between the BEF and the sea and later came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> move had, by using up scarce rail capacity for ten days, prevented him from reinforcing Lille and had allowed the Germans to capture it.|$|E

25|$|The fall of Peel's {{government}} in 1846 changed these intimate relations; {{and the return}} of Palmerston to the foreign office led Guizot to believe that he was again exposed to the passionate rivalry of the British cabinet. A friendly understanding had been established between the two courts with reference to the future marriage of the young queen of Spain. The language of Lord Palmerston and the conduct of Sir Henry Bulwer (afterwards Lord Dalling) at Madrid led Guizot <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> understanding was broken, provoking the Affair of the Spanish Marriages after Guizot came to believe that Britain intended to place a Coburg on the throne of Spain. Determined to resist any such intrigue, Guizot and the king plunged headlong into a counter-intrigue, wholly inconsistent with their previous engagements to Britain and fatal to the happiness of the queen of Spain. By their influence she was urged into a marriage with a despicable offset of the house of Bourbon, and her sister was at the same time married to the youngest son of the French king, in direct violation of Louis Philippe's promises. This transaction, although it was hailed at the time as a triumph of the policy of France, was in truth as fatal to the monarch as it was discreditable to the minister. It was accomplished by a mixture of secrecy and violence. It was defended by subterfuges. Its immediate effect was to destroy the Anglo-French alliance, and to throw Guizot into closer relations with the reactionary policy of Metternich and the Northern courts.|$|E

There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps."

500|$|It was {{originally}} discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801. He called the mineral [...] "brown lead" [...] and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, {{he was later}} led <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefström discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río's [...] "brown lead" [...] was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, Hidalgo, Mexico, and was named vanadinite because of its high vanadium content. Other names that have since been given to vanadinite are johnstonite and lead vanadate.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Bruce Eder {{wrote that the}} album [...] "shows a mature Elvis Presley [...] {{displayed}} the rich, deep vocalizing that would challenge critics' expectations of Elvis Presley playing rhythm guitar throughout". Eder concluded that on Elvis Is Back!, Presley [...] "comes off better than on any of his other albums since arriving at RCA". Will Hermes of Rolling Stone praised its [...] "wildly varied material, revelatory singing, impeccable stereo sound". [...] Writing for Rough Guides in 2004, Paul Simpson commented: [...] "Among the 1800 or so records in Elvis's collection at Graceland is a copy of Elvis Is Back!, almost white {{from the number of}} times it was played. You can understand why this would be his favourite album." [...] Simpson admired Presley's blues singing on [...] "Like a Baby" [...] and [...] "Reconsider Baby", and added, [...] "it's hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> commitment and exhilaration was to be heard only fitfully for most of the 1960s, often on songs buried on B-sides or as bonuses on dodgy soundtrack albums." ...|$|E
