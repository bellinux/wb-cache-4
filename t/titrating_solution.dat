5000|$|In {{thermometric}} titrations, {{a constant}} addition rate of titrant equates to a constant {{amount of heat}} being given out or consumed, and hence {{a more or less}} constant temperature change up to the endpoint. In a titration, the titrant reacts with the analyte in the sample either exothermically or endothermically. The thermoprobe measures the temperature of the <b>titrating</b> <b>solution.</b> When all of the analyte in the sample has reacted with the titrant, the temperature of the solution will change, and the endpoint of the titration is revealed by an inflection in the temperature curve. 8 ...|$|E
50|$|Potentiometric titrations {{were first}} used for redox titrations by Crotogino. He titrated halide ions using {{potassium}} permanganate using a shiny platinum electrode and a calomel electrode. He {{says that if}} an oxidizing agent is added to a reducing solution then the equilibrium between the reducing substance and reaction product will shift towards the reaction product. The changes the potential very slowly until the amount of reducing substance becomes very small. A large change in potential will occur then once a small addition of the <b>titrating</b> <b>solution</b> is added, as the final amounts of reducing agent are removed and the potential corresponds solely to the oxidizing agent. This large increase in potential difference signifies the endpoint of the reaction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{titration}} {{environment is}} considered unsuitable for conventional titration sensors. For example, glass membrane pH electrodes {{must be kept}} adequately hydrated for proper operation. The use of such electrodes in substantially non-aqueous media as in the determination of trace acids in lipids and lubricating oils can lead to loss of performance as the membrane fouls and dehydrates, and/or if the reference junction is partly or completely blocked. It is often necessary to keep a number of electrodes cycling through a rejuvenation program {{in order to keep}} up with an analytical workload. Thermometric sensors have no electrochemical interaction with the <b>titrating</b> <b>solution,</b> and therefore can be used on a continuous basis with essentially no maintenance. Similarly, the potentiometric titration of sulfate with barium chloride in various industrial samples can lead to rapid degradation of the indicating barium ion selective electrode.|$|E

Dry glassware and inert atmosphere are required for these reactions. Alternatively, lithium amides may be prepared by the direct action of lithium on the corresponding amine. Typical temperatures for isomerization reactions employing lithium amides are between 0 °C and reflux (ether/hexane solvent mixtures derived from the synthesis of the lithium amide are usually used directly for isomerization reactions). An excess of the base is employed to account for impurities that consume base and reaction of the base with the ether solvent. Care should be taken when HMPA is added to lithium amide reactions, as it is a known animal carcinogen.|$|R

50|$|A burette is a {{volumetric}} measuring glassware {{which is}} used in analytical chemistry for accurate dispensing of variable, and for measuring the volume of a liquid, especially {{of one of the}} reagents in a titration.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} technical simplicity with which visual complexometric titrations of metal cations with aminopolycarboxylic acids titrants are performed, a complex chemistry {{takes place in the}} <b>titrated</b> <b>solution</b> during the titration, due to the chemical environment and to the insuppressible chemical properties of metal cations, aminopolycarboxylic acids and metallochromic indicators. This chemical complexity makes rigorous exposition and evaluations of complexometric titrations arduous. Nonetheless, by the introduction of the notions of groups of chemical species and reactions between groups of chemical species (with the connected concept of conditional formation constant), a frame is created within which complexometric titrations with aminopolycarboxylic acids can be collocated and which allows a reasonably simple presentation and evaluation of the analytically relevant aspects of this type of titrations.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and solubility {{behaviors of}} four generation five (G 5) triazine dendrimers are studied. While the underivatized cationic dendrimer is soluble in water, the acetylated and propanoylated derivatives undergo coacervation in water upon increasing temperature. Occurring around room temperature, this behavior {{is related to}} a liquid-liquid phase transition with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and is explained by differences in composition, notably, the hydrophobic nature of the terminal groups. Interestingly, the water solubility of the acetylated dendrimer {{is affected by the}} addition of selected metal ions. <b>Titrating</b> <b>solutions</b> of acetylated dendrimer at temperatures below the LCST with gold or palladium ions promoted precipitation, but platinum, iridium, and copper did not.

50|$|The most {{practical}} sensor for measuring temperature change in <b>titrating</b> <b>solutions</b> {{has been found}} to be the thermistor. Thermistors are small solid state devices which exhibit relatively large changes in electrical resistance for small changes in temperature. They are manufactured from sintered mixed metal oxides, with lead wires enabling connection to electrical circuitry. The thermistor is encapsulated in a suitable electrically insulating medium with satisfactory heat transfer characteristics and acceptable chemical resistance. Typically for thermistors used for chemical analysis the encapsulating medium is glass, although thermistors encapsulated in epoxy resin may be used in circumstances where either chemical attack (e.g., by acidic fluoride-containing solutions) or severe mechanical stress is anticipated. The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic circuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature. The circuitry in the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature changes as low as 10−5 K.|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between the found value and the real value {{is known as the}} absolute error. When applied to a titration, the absolute error comes from the {{difference between}} the real amount of analyte present in the sample and the amount of it calculated from the titration data (namely, the titrant volume at the endpoint and the titrant molarity). In most cases, the true amount of analyte is a statistical problem. In titrations, the relative error is minimized when endpoint and stoichiometric point (both in terms of consumed volume of titrant) are very close to each other. More widely used is the percent relative error (PRE). In this exercise, a volumetric titration is carried out using a visual indicator to determine the endpoint. The analyst must stop titration just at the moment the <b>titrated</b> <b>solution</b> changes color. From the titrant volume required and data about the analyzed problem, the percent relative error should be calculated. When overtitration occurs, the error value becomes significant...|$|R

The true concentration of charged monomer units in the PEL solutions, whose initial concentration was 0.002  M, related to their both charged and uncharged monomer units, was calculated from the consumed amount of the titrator solution. The true concentration of charged monomer units was always smaller compared to the monomer unit concentration of 0.002  M. The ratio between true charged monomer and monomer concentration can be expressed by the factor F (see above).|$|R
50|$|As the {{titration}} progresses, the protons are neutralized to form {{water by}} the addition of NaOH. For each amount of NaOH added equivalent amount of hydrogen ions is removed. Effectively, the mobile H+ cation is replaced by the less-mobile Na+ ion, and the conductivity of the <b>titrated</b> <b>solution</b> as well as the measured conductance of the cell fall. This continues until the equivalence point is reached, at which one obtains a solution of sodium chloride, NaCl. If more base is added, an increase in conductivity or conductance is observed, since more ions Na+ and OH− are being added and the neutralization reaction no longer removes an appreciable amount of H+. Consequently, in the titration of a strong acid with a strong base, the conductance has a minimum at the equivalence point. This minimum can be used, instead of an indicator dye, to determine the endpoint of the titration. The conductometric titration curve is a plot of the measured conductance or conductivity values {{as a function of the}} volume of the NaOH solution added. The titration curve can be used to graphically determine the equivalence point.|$|R

He found that in a cell composed of mercurous nitrate and mercurous nitrate/mercury, the initial voltage is 0. If potassium chloride is added to mercurous nitrate on one side, mercury (I) chloride is precipitated. This decreased the osmotic pressure of mercury (I) ions on the side and creates a potential difference. This potential difference increases slowly as additional potassium chloride is added, but then increases more rapidly. He found the greatest potential difference is achieved once all of the mercurous nitrate has been precipitated. This was used to discern end points of titrations.|$|R
30|$|A {{synthetic}} gibbsite MARTINAL® OL- 111 /LE (Martinswerk GmbH, Bergheim, Germany) with a {{purity of}} 99.4 % (data certified by supplier) was used without further pretreatment. The {{purity of the}} material was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (D 500, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) and scanning electron microscopy (LEO 435 Lv, Leo Elektronenmikroskopie GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). The amount of surface hydroxyl groups and their acid–base properties were characterized by batch-back titration [24], using a PC-controlled titration system (751 GPD Titrino with software Vesuv 3.0, Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland). For this purpose, suspensions of 1.0  g of gibbsite in 50  mL of NaClO 4 solution were prepared, establishing three parallel series with 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001  M NaClO 4 concentrations, respectively. Then diluted nitric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions were added {{in such a manner}} that every incremental pH value (0.1 – 0.2 pH unit increments) between 3.0 and 12.0 was adjusted using an individual sample for every specific pH value. The consumed acid or base amounts were registered. The sample vessels were end-over-end shaken overnight at room temperature. Afterwards, the phases were separated by centrifugation (5000 g) and membrane filtration (0.2  µm). After pH determination, 25  mL of each supernatant was collected and slowly back titrated until the initial pH value was reached. Between any titre dosage, a hold time of 3  min was maintained. The amount of active surface hydroxyl groups was deduced from the differences between the titre amounts added during the first and the second titration step. The remaining amount of supernatant was used for the analytical determination of solved Al ions (AAS 3030, Perkin-Elmer, Überlingen, Germany). Based on these data, the amounts of gibbsite particles in the <b>titrated</b> <b>solutions</b> were calculated.
