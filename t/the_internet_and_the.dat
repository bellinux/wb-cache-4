5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E

25|$|Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, {{including}} baseball cards, {{exploded in}} price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading.

Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values.

Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.|$|E

25|$|Technology can {{be viewed}} as an {{activity}} that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known.

Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.|$|E
25|$|Also in Argentina DAIM's works {{would leave}} their marks: The Argentinian {{graffiti}} scene started to develop {{at the beginning}} of the 1990s.

Furthermore, local writers from Argentina got influenced graffiti they saw on their journeys to Europe and brought back those impressions to their home country. In 2001 DAIM travelled to Buenos Aires. At this time there were a maximum of 20 acknowledged writers in the city, but with advanced access to <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> launch of the first national graffiti homepage it was expected that this number would soon rise.|$|E
