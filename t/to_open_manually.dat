50|$|The whole {{vehicle is}} {{protected}} against heavy blast mines (up to 10 kg) and projectile charges from below, while still retaining 450 mm ground clearance. Almost all equipment within the cabin, including the seats, has no direct contact to the floor, which adds to crew and technical safety. All cabin roof hatches {{are of the}} side-slide type, which make them easier <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>manually,</b> {{even when they are}} obstructed by debris. The exhaust is mixed with fresh air and vented at the rear left side. Together with a special IR-suppressing paint, this aims at reducing the thermal signature of the IFV.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 {{a new and}} {{innovative}} anti-aircraft gun was designed. Partly based on the M/16, it was mounted on a low-slung trailer with three outriggers. Two of them folded together for transportation, and two rubber wheels could be mounted. The outriggers could be adjusted in elevation to a limited extent to help place the mount in a horizontal position. The mount allowed for a 360° traverse and an elevation between 0° and 85°. The gun had a muzzle brake to reduce recoil, a hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder and a gas cylinder to aid the forward movement of the barrel at high elevations. In addition the mount had two heavy springs to counterbalance the barrel, as the entire barrel was mounted ahead of the pivots. It (the barrel), was 45 calibres long and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right - like the M/16's barrel. The breech block was also similar to the M/16: a semi-automatic horizontal wedge that the gunner had <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>manually</b> to remove the case from the previous shot, but which closed automatically on insertion of a new round.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of September 27, 2016, a track fault {{resulted}} in the damage of the collector shoes on 15 train cars. This resulted in multiple delays and disruptions across the entire network and the damaged collector shoes further damaged the entire network's tracks. During the morning peak of the following day (September 28, 2016), the already damaged track resulted in further disruptions 4 hours after train service started. When the trains did arrive the stations, more problems occurred, including stalled trains, smoke, and stuck doors that staff had <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>manually.</b> With damaged tracks {{and half of the}} usual fleet running, the delays were more severe than previous cases this year (2016). Later in the afternoon, SMRT announced on social media, Facebook and Twitter, stating that only Service B is available and no train service towards Choa Chu Kang Station. However, they announced again that train service has been temporarily suspended as engineers were carrying out maintenance and repair works. Train service fully resumes at 5:45pm with only half of the usual fleet operating.|$|E

50|$|The Zunow SLR, {{which went}} on sale in 1958 (in Japan only), was the first 35mm SLR camera with an {{automatic}} diaphragm, which stopped down to the preselected aperture upon release of the shutter. (Although this invention had been anticipated by the 1954 Praktina FX-A which featured a semi-automatic diaphragm, which stopped down automatically, but had <b>to</b> be <b>opened</b> <b>manually</b> after the exposure.) The automatic diaphragm feature eliminated one downside to viewing with an SLR: the darkening of the viewfinder screen image when the photographer selected a small lens aperture. The Zunow Optical Company also supplied the Miranda Camera Company with lenses for their Miranda T SLR cameras.|$|R

2500|$|Cash drawers {{that are}} {{integral}} to a stand-alone register {{often have a}} manual release catch underneath <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the drawer {{in the event of}} a power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a cylinder lock, requiring a key <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>open</b> the drawer. The cylinder lock usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the [...] "locked" [...] position, the drawer will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.|$|R
25|$|At 07:00 JST on 12 March, Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Daiichi {{director}} Masao Yoshida why {{his workers}} were not opening the valves to release rising steam pressure within the reactor. Yoshida answered {{that they could}} not open the electrical valves because of the power failure and the radiation was too high to send workers <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>open</b> the valves. Nevertheless, with the pressure and temperatures continuing to rise, at 09:15, TEPCO sent workers to begin manually opening the valves. The high radiation slowed the work and the valves were not opened until 14:30.|$|R
50|$|The {{volume in}} the loop is usually {{controlled}} by a pressure controlled automatic diluent valve, which works on the same principle as a demand valve. This adds diluent when the pressure {{in the loop}} is reduced below ambient pressure, such as during descent or if gas is lost from the loop. The set may also have a manual addition valve, sometimes called a bypass.In some early oxygen rebreathers the user had <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>open</b> and close the valve to the oxygen cylinder to refill the counterlung each time the volume got low.|$|R

Helga makes contact with Drummond at a shooting party, and attempts to kill him by planting a bomb in his telephone after sleeping with him. Then Helga and Pandora try to kill Drummond again by sabotaging a glider fight, having cut the ripcord from his parachute. Drummond manages <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>open</b> his parachute and escape death.|$|R
50|$|In {{some early}} oxygen rebreathers the diver had <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>open</b> {{and close the}} valve to the oxygen {{cylinder}} to refill the counter-lung each time the volume got low. In others the oxygen flow is kept constant by a pressure-reducing flow valve like the valves on blowtorch cylinders; the set also has a manual on/off valve called a bypass. In some modern oxygen rebreathers, the pressure in the breathing bag controls the oxygen flow like the demand valve in open-circuit scuba; for example, trying to breathe in from an empty bag makes the cylinder release more gas.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the line over Storo {{was cut off}} from its turning circle {{terminus}} due to construction work. To get around this problem, a number of old trams were purchased from Gothenburg {{at the price of}} 1 krone each. These trams, which had been built between 1958 and 1962, and designated M25 in Gothenburg, were coupled back-to-back so that a driver's cabin was available {{at either end of the}} train. They were designated SM91 in Oslo. The condition of the SM91 was somewhat better than the aging Høka cars, so they replaced them. The SM91 was never popular with passengers, they were as noisy as the Høka, and the rear doors, which would only allow people out of the tram, had <b>to</b> be pushed <b>open</b> <b>manually</b> by passengers from the inside. After a fatal accident involving the doors of this tram type in January 2001, the trams were no longer run coupled together. They were finally retired in November 2002.|$|R

40|$|During {{a recent}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health field {{evaluation}} of a newly designed filtration and pressurization system for an enclosed cab of a surface drill, {{it was determined that}} the drill operator's respirable-dust exposure was significantly increased during time periods when the cab door was <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> guide another section of drill steel into place to achieve additional cutting depth. Although no dust cloud was visible when the door was <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> perform this task, the drill operator's exposure was documented (over a three-day test period) to be nine times higher than when the cab door was closed. Even at this higher respirable-dust concentration, the drill operator's exposure remained well below the permissible exposure limit governed by the federal dust standard; however, an alternative method is being investigated to guide the drill steel in place in order to eliminate this increased exposure. ...|$|R

40|$|Why a {{handheld}} computer? "Because I usually don’t carry a bag…it (the HC) goes with me everywhere" The {{aim of the}} study is to explore the use of {{a handheld}} computer (HC) by college students with learning disabilities and ADHD, as well as its practicality as an aid to the planning and organization of learning in academia and in daily scheduling. The study describes 3 case studies tracking three students: Two of them used a handheld computer, while one student kept a conventional planner. The study's findings clearly show that the students using a handheld computer reported an increased reliance on the device compared to the other student. The device compensated for the students’ organizational and memory related difficulties: the students keyed in tasks, notes, memos and especially reminders. In contrast to the interactivity of the electronic planner, the conventional planner requires the student's initiation <b>to</b> <b>open</b> it <b>manually</b> {{at least once a day}} to recall the written events. The handheld technology contains many other options, such as a GPS device, visual and audio recording devices, etc. These were largely not accounted for in our study. These options- as well as further handheld/cellular phone integration, might improve the organization and study processes. Continued research regarding the compensatory effectiveness of select technologies for specific difficulties should be developed...|$|R
50|$|The M/16 was a {{relatively}} simple design. It was intended for static emplacement, and was mounted on a pedestal, allowing for 360° sideways movement. The mount allowed for an angle of elevation of between -1° and 75°. The gun barrel was 45 calibres long, and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right. The breech block was a semi-automatic horizontal wedge - the gunner had <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>open</b> it <b>to</b> remove the case from the previous shot, but it closed automatically on the insertion of a new round. There was a hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder under the barrel, with a heavy spring to aid the forward motion of the gun at high elevation.

50|$|The coaster opened {{along with}} the rest of the park on opening day 1971. The old style Arrow Development cars are made so the ride {{operator}} has <b>to</b> <b>open</b> them up <b>manually.</b> The ride normally operates with one or two trains due to the low popularity. While the ride does not have a high attendance, it is still a favorite of many guests because the ride is not as aggressive as the other roller coasters in the park. Children who prefer not riding the park's most aggressive rides such as: Apocalypse, Goliath, Revolution, Superman: Escape from Krypton, and X2 ride Gold Rusher because the ride itself is not as aggressive and gives the guests a good amount of thrill. Wait times are usually no longer than 5 minutes during the off-peak season. It was the first roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain, making it a historical coaster. The ride has undergone no changes ever since it began operating in 1971.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, a new {{generation}} of advanced suburban passenger train was being considered by the State Rail Authority. There was a delay in the construction of these trains, and 56 interim stainless steel air conditioned cars, C3581-3608 and T4247-4274, were built by Goninan, known as the 'Chopper Cars' for their chopper control. These cars trialled several features of the next generation cars, such as fixed seating, door chimes and passenger address systems. They were originally fitted with a push-button feature, to enable passengers <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the doors <b>manually,</b> but this feature was short-lived. They retained the flat ends of the previous Goninan cars, but {{with the addition of a}} fibreglass moulded end piece which was originally white with orange and red stripes (the 'candy' State Rail livery). These ends were later painted grey with a lower yellow section which they retain to this day, and internally the standard grey livery and blue seat upholstery was applied. These cars continue to operate as C sets.|$|R
