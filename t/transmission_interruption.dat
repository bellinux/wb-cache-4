40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} decades China {{has made a}} great stride in {{controlling}} schistosomiasis, eliminating transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in 5 provinces and remarkably reducing transmission intensities {{in the rest of}} the seven endemic provinces. Recently, an integrated control strategy, which focuses on interventions on humans and bovines, has been implemented throughout endemic areas in China. This strategy assumes that a reduction in transmission of S. japonicum from humans and bovines to the intermediate Oncomelania snail host would eventually block the transmission of this parasite, and has yielded effective results in some endemic areas. Yet the transmission of S. japonicum is relatively complicated – in addition to humans and bovines, more than 40 species of mammalians can serve as potential zoonotic reservoirs. Here, we caution that some factors – potential roles of other mammalian reservoirs and human movement in sustaining the transmission, low sensitivity/specificity of current diagnostic tools for infections, praziquantel treatment failures, changes in environmental and socio-economic factors such as flooding in key endemic areas - may pose great obstacles towards <b>transmission</b> <b>interruption</b> of the parasite. Assessing potential roles of these factors in the transmission and implications for current control strategies aiming at <b>transmission</b> <b>interruption</b> is needed. </p...|$|E

30|$|Besides, {{because of}} the absence of the license, the {{available}} spectrum resources for SUs are usually temporary and unstable, which results in <b>transmission</b> <b>interruption</b> with high probability. One of considerable solutions is to enable SUs to search for spectrum resources from multiple primary networks (PRNs) simultaneously. The authors of [10] considered the mobile users operating on different radio access technologies (RATs), and the single-user case is analyzed. In the multiple PRNs, however, the available spectrum resources are usually quite wide as well as discontinuous. This leads to that the cognitive radios operating on such spectrum resources are price prohibitive due to the increase of sampling rate. In addition, different PRNs restrict different power values of CRNs in one resource allocation, which greatly increases the computational complexity of ARA.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Reported malaria {{cases in}} rice growing areas in western Tajikistan {{were at the}} root of a rapid {{appraisal}} of the local malaria situation in a selected agro-ecological setting where only scarce information was available. The rapid appraisal was complemented by a review of the epidemiology and control of malaria in Tajikistan and Central Asia from 1920 until today. Following a resurgence in the 1990 s, malaria transmission has been reduced considerably in Tajikistan as a result of concerted efforts by the government and international agencies. The goal for 2015 is <b>transmission</b> <b>interruption,</b> with control interventions and surveillance currently concentrated in the South, where foci of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum persist. Methods The rapid malaria appraisal was carried out in six communities of irrigated rice cultivation during the peak of malaria transmission (August/September 2007) in western Tajikistan. In a cross-sectional survey, blood samples were taken from 363 schoolchildren and examined for Plasmodium under a light microscope. A total of 56 farmers were interviewed about agricultural activities and malaria. Potential Anopheles breeding sites were characterized using standardized procedures. A literature review on the epidemiology and control of malaria in Tajikistan was conducted. Results One case of P. vivax was detected among the 363 schoolchildren examined (0. 28 %). The interviewees reported to protect themselves against mosquito bites and used their own concepts on fever conditions, which do not distinguish between malaria and other diseases. Three potential malaria vectors were identified, i. e. Anopheles superpictus, Anopheles pulcherrimus and Anopheles hyrcanus in 58 of the 73 breeding sites examined (79. 5 %). Rice paddies, natural creeks and man-made ponds were the most important Anopheles habitats. Conclusion The presence of malaria vectors and parasite reservoirs, low awareness of, and protection against malaria in the face of population movements and inadequate surveillance may render local communities vulnerable to potential epidemics. To attain malaria <b>transmission</b> <b>interruption</b> in Tajikistan by 2015, {{there is a need for}} rigorous surveillance along with strengthening of primary health care facilities for effective case management, and possibly a more differentiated vector control strategy based on additional local evidence. </p...|$|E

However since IEEE 802. 16 e standard for Mobile WiMAX defines only hard handover mandatory, Mobile WiMAX cannot transmit or receive packets during handover.

The long interruption of hard handover is horrible for real-time applications like IPTV, VoIP and Sat TV. Our proposed solution solves this latency problem during handover. In our scheme minimum number of Base Stations will be scanned and MS should scan only those BSs which can fulfil the bandwidth requirement of MS.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{penetration of}} wind power introduces increased flexibility requirements {{on the power}} system and puts increased pressure on the instantaneous reserve levels required. Instantaneous reserves are a security product that ensures that electricity demand can continue to be met {{in the event of}} unplanned generation or <b>transmission</b> <b>interruptions.</b> This reserve must be available to respond very quickly to generation-demand variability. While this is an integral component of the power system, providing instantaneous reserve increases the production cost of power. More calls from energy researchers and stakeholders ask for loads to play an increasingly important role in balancing the short timescale fluctuations in generated wind power. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the current level of demand responsiveness among domestic refrigerators, freezers, and water heaters and their potential to contribute towards instantaneous reserve and balance the fluctuation of wind. Refrigerators, freezers, and water heaters can generally store energy due to their thermal mass. Interrupting these domestic loads for short time by employing direct load control strategies makes it possible to control these appliances by turning them on or off before their reach their maximum or minimum temperatures or by slightly modifying their temperature set point. Using this strategy helps to ensure that the overall satisfaction of consumers should not be affected. This study first modelled the load profiles of the participated residential appliances and statistically assessed the potential of controlling these residential loads using direct load control strategies to contribute towards instantaneous reserves to mitigate and balance the fluctuation of wind power in the years: 2014, 2020 and 2030. In the second section, it demonstrated the capabilities of the assessed residential responsive loads within Wellington Region network to compensate for and balance the fluctuation of wind power generated from the West Wind Farm in seven selected days in 2013 - 2014 as a showcase. Such technology can enable a power system operator to remove the burden of both providing instantaneous reserve from conventional sources, and instead maintain such capacity from available residential demand response. The study ends with recommendations to engage residential loads in fast timescale demand response and suggests directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a dynamic {{spectrum}} access strategy to reduce the average overall system time of secondary users (SUs) in multi-channel cognitive radio networks. Before transmitting a packet, SU senses the spectrum environment. If there are free channels in the system, SU randomly selects one for transmitting. If all the channels are busy, we consider a probability-based spectrum selection scheme in which the access channel is chosen based on the predetermined probabilities for saving the sensing power and reducing the overall system time of SU. When the transmission of SU is preempted by the primary user (PU), SU will stay on the operating channel and retransmit the whole data after PU leaves the channel. SU may undergo multiple interruptions before finishing a successful <b>transmission.</b> The <b>interruptions</b> and retransmissions inevitably increase the overall system time of SU. We propose an analytical model by applying the preemptive repeat identical priority M/G/ 1 queueing theory. Based on the model, we obtain the overall system time expression of SU packets under different spectrum environment and find the optimal distribution vector for the probabilitybased spectrum access scheme to minimize the average overall system time for SU...|$|R
