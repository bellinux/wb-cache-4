25|$|<b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.|$|E

2500|$|Tube sinking, {{also known}} as free tube drawing, reduces the {{diameter}} of the tube without a mandrel inside the tube. The inner diameter (ID) is determined by the inner and outer diameter of the stock tube, the outer diameter of the final product, the length of the die landing, the amount of back tension, and the friction between the tube and the die. This type of drawing operation is the most economical, especially on thick-walled tubes and tubes smaller than [...] in diameter, but does not give the best surface finish. As the tube thickness increases <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> quality decreases. This process is often used for the tubing on low-cost lawn furniture.|$|E
2500|$|Rod {{drawing is}} the process that draws the tube with a mandrel inside the tube; the mandrel is drawn with the tube. The {{advantage}} to this process is that the mandrel defines the ID and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> and has a quick setup time for short runs. The disadvantages are that lengths are limited by {{the length of the}} mandrel, usually no more than , and that a second operation is required to remove the mandrel, called reeling. This type of process is usually used on heavy walled or small ID tubes. Common applications include super-high pressure tubing and hydraulic tubing (with the addition of a finishing tube sinking operation). This process is also use for precision manufacturing of trombone handslides (see, for example, [...] of the process of making Getzen trombones).|$|E
2500|$|The {{process begins}} with a {{descaling}} and removing soil from the workpiece. This {{can be done in}} the tumbler or in a separate cleaning system. After cleaning, the parts are prepared by combining them with water, medium, and a surface conditioner. The surface conditioner [...] lightly coats the workpiece in copper, while the medium removes any residual mill scale or oxides. Finally, accelerators, promoters and metal powder are added to the mix. The accelerators and promoters provide the proper chemical environment for the plating to occur, such as the maintenance of a pH level of 1 to 2 to prevent oxidation and promote adhesion. The medium that is already in the mixture cold welds the metal powder to the workpiece through impacts that are induced by the tumbling action of the tumbler. At this point <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> is typically matte to a semi-bright finish, however the finish can be improved with a water polish. The time required for the above process is approximately 50minutes.|$|E
