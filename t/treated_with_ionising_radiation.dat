40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are {{professional}} antigen-presenting cells (APC) of {{the immune}} system, uniquely able to prime naïve T-cell responses. They {{are the focus of}} a range of novel strategies for the immunotherapy of cancer, a proportion of which include <b>treating</b> DC <b>with</b> <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> to high dose. The effects of radiation on DC have not, however, been fully characterised. We therefore cultured human myeloid DC from CD 14 + precursors, and studied the effects of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> on their phenotype and function. Dendritic cells were remarkably resistant against radiation-induced apoptosis, showed limited changes in surface phenotype, and mostly maintained their endocytic, phagocytic and migratory capacity. However, irradiated DC were less effective in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, and on maturation produced significantly less IL- 12 than unirradiated controls, while IL- 10 secretion was maintained. Furthermore, peptide-pulsed irradiated mature DC were less effective at naïve T-cell priming, stimulating fewer effector cells with lower cytotoxicity against antigen-specific targets. Hence irradiation of DC in vitro, and potentially in vivo, has a significant impact on their function, and may shift the balance between T-cell activation and tolerisation in DC-mediated immune responses...|$|R

Preventive treatments to minimise these side effects have not been possible {{due to the lack}} of knowledge of the involved signalling pathways and molecular targets. Mouse hippocampal neuronal HT 22 cells were irradiated with acute gamma doses of 0. 5 Gy, 1. 0 Gy and 4. 0 Gy. Changes in the cellular proteome were investigated by isotope-coded protein label technology and tandem mass spectrometry after 4 and 24 hours. To compare the findings with the in vivo response, male NMRI mice were irradiated on postnatal day 10 with a gamma dose of 1. 0 Gy, followed by evaluation of the cellular proteome of hippocampus and cortex 24 hours post-irradiation. Analysis of the in vitro proteome showed that signalling pathways related to synaptic actin-remodelling were significantly affected at 1. 0 Gy and 4. 0 Gy but not at 0. 5 Gy after 4 and 24 hours. We observed radiation-induced reduction of the miR- 132 and Rac 1 levels; miR- 132 is known to regulate Rac 1 activity by blocking the GTPase-activating protein p 250 GAP. In the irradiated hippocampus and cortex we observed alterations in the signalling pathways similar to those in vitro. The decreased expression of miR- 132 and Rac 1 was associated with an increase in hippocampal cofilin and phospho-cofilin.

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND [...] A {{previous}} study {{has shown that}} in age-related macular degeneration {{a high degree of}} concordance of disciform scar size occurs in the two eyes of any one patient. In a study of 35 patients with choroidal neovascular membrane who were <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> low dose <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> to the macula of the affected eye, 11 were found to have bilateral disease. METHODS [...] The visual outcome and scar size and morphology in the two eyes of each of these patients were compared. RESULTS [...] In all radiotherapy treated eyes the appearance of the scar ranged from subtle subretinal pigmentary changes to dense subretinal fibrosis. By contrast all untreated fellow eyes showed marked subretinal scarring. Scars in radiotherapy treated eyes occupied an area that was approximately one third of that in untreated fellow eyes (3. 8 mm 2 v 11. 7 mm 2). Distance and near visual acuities in radiotherapy treated eyes were significantly better than that of untreated fellow eyes (p < 0. 0033). Although untreated fellow eyes of necessity had longer follow up periods (64. 5 months), the mean follow up time in treated eyes was 28 months by which time the disciform response is generally thought to have ceased evolving.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of breast cancer patients are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radiotherapy. <b>Ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> induces different DNA damages, of which double-strand breaks are the most severe. They are mainly repaired by homologous recombination or non-homologous end-joining. Different protein complexes have central roles in these repair processes. In addition {{to the ability to}} repair DNA damage, cellular radiosensitivity is also affected by mitogenic signals that stimulate survival and inhibit apoptosis. The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) /AKT pathway controls cell proliferation, invasiveness and cell survival. AKT is regulated by upstream growth factor receptors, one of them being HER 2 (also called ErbB 2). HER 2 is overexpressed in 15 - 30 % of all breast cancers and associated with poor prognosis. In this thesis, we have studied factors that affect tumour cell resistance to <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> In Paper I, the role of HER 2 /PI 3 -K/AKT signalling in radiation resistance was investigated in two breast cancer cell lines. The results support the hypothesis that the HER 2 /PI 3 -K/AKT pathway is involved in resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells in which this signalling pathway is overstimulated. We also investigated if the protein expression of several DNA repair-associated proteins influence the prognosis and treatment response in early breast cancer. Moderate/strong expression of the MRE 11 /RAD 50 /NBS 1 (MRN) complex predicted good response to radiotherapy, whereas patients with negative/weak MRN had no benefit from radiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy (Paper II). These results suggest that an intact MRNcomplex is important for the tumour-eradicating effect of radiotherapy. In Paper III, low expression of the BRCA 1 /BRCA 2 /RAD 51 complex was associated with an aggressive phenotype, an increased risk of local recurrence and good response to radiotherapy. In Paper IV, we studied if a single nucleotide polymorphism, RAD 51 135 G/C, was related to RAD 51 protein expression, prognosis and therapy resistance. We found that genotype was not correlated to neither protein expression nor prognosis. Patients who were G/G homozygotes had a significant benefit from radiotherapy. The results also suggested that the RAD 51 135 G/C polymorphism predicts the effect of chemotherapy in early breast cancer. In conclusion, DNA repair proteins are potential prognostic and predictive markers. The results indicate that proteins in different repair pathways may contribute differently to the effect of radiotherapy. Also, the HER 2 /PI 3 -K/AKT signalling pathway protects cells from radiation-induced apoptosis. In the future, {{it might be possible to}} target some of these proteins with inhibitory drugs to sensitise tumours to radiotherapy...|$|R

50|$|The {{avalanche}} {{mechanism is}} shown in the accompanying diagram. The electric field is applied across a gaseous medium; initial ions are created <b>with</b> <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> (for example, cosmic rays). An original ionisation event produces an ion pair; the positive ion accelerates towards the cathode while the free electron accelerates towards the anode. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron can gain sufficient velocity (energy) to liberate another electron when it next collides with a molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause further impact ionisations, and so on. This process is effectively a chain reaction that generates free electrons. The total number of electrons reaching the anode is equal to the number of collisions, plus the single initiating free electron. Initially, the number of collisions grows exponentially. The limit to the multiplication in an electron avalanche is known as the Raether limit.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{vertebral}} column deformations {{are exposed to}} high risks associated <b>with</b> <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure. Risks are further increased due to the serial X-ray images that are needed to measure and asses their spinal deformation using Cobb or superimposition methods.

OBJECTIVES: With a specific focus on lateral thoraco-lumbar images for Cobb and superimposition measurements, this paper outlines a systematic procedure to the optimisation of X-ray practice. METHODS: Optimisation was conducted based on suitable image quality from minimal dose. Image quality was appraised using a visual-analogue-rating-scale, and Monte-Carlo modelling was used for dose estimation. The optimised X-ray practice was identified by imaging healthy normal-weight male adult living human volunteers.

Spatially resolved measurements with protons show a large variation of the {{charge collection}} efficiency, whereas for photons and minimum ionising particles the response is much more uniform and in the order of 18 %.

40|$|The topoisomerase I (TOP 1) {{inhibitor}} irinotecan triggers {{cell death}} by trapping TOP 1 on DNA, generating cytotoxic protein-linked DNA breaks (PDBs). Despite its wide application {{in a variety}} of solid tumors, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to irinotecan remains poorly understood. Here, we generated colorectal cancer (CRC) cell models for irinotecan resistance and report that resistance is neither due to downregulation of the main cellular target of irinotecan TOP 1 nor upregulation of the key TOP 1 PDB repair factor TDP 1. Instead, the faster repair of PDBs underlies resistance, which is associated with perturbed histone H 4 K 16 acetylation. Subsequent treatment of irinotecan-resistant, but not parental, CRC cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can effectively overcome resistance. Immunohistochemical analyses of CRC tissues further corroborate the importance of histone H 4 K 16 acetylation in CRC.

Expression of DNA-PKcs positively correlated with both Ku 86 and Ku 70, and a statistically significant correlation between the Ku subunits was also found.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is a non-invasive technique that provides structural and functional information. Its origins {{date back to}} the 1930 s when magnetic characteristics of atomic nuclei were first described. However, it was not until 1971 that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was applied in biomedical applications, when Dr Raymond Damadian measured T 1 and T 2 relaxation times (see ‘Basic concepts’ section) in rat neoplasms and observed that neoplastic tissue possessed longer T 2 relaxation times than those of normal tissue. At that same time Dr Damadian correctly predicted that the NMR technique might prove useful in the detection of malignant neoplasms. In 1977 the first magnetic resonance images of humans were produced (the ‘N’ was dropped to avoid negative connotations associated with ‘nuclear’). Fundamental work in diffusion imaging in 1984 laid the groundwork for functional MRI techniques, and in 1986, the first reports of the calculation of diffusion coefficients occurred. In the following years, diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI using blood oxygenation level-dependent techniques were also developed. Today, an ever-growing array of novel techniques for MRI is currently under investigation {{to increase the number of}} structural and functional (eg, tissue angiogenesis, tissue ultrastructure) correlations that can be assessed using magnetic resonance-based techniques.
