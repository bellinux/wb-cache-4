5|$|New Zealand {{is one of}} 16 realms {{within the}} Commonwealth. The Realm of New Zealand is the entire area over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign, and {{comprises}} New Zealand, Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue. The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand. The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each <b>Tokelauan</b> atoll). The Ross Dependency is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility. New Zealand nationality law treats {{all parts of the}} realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand citizens.|$|E

25|$|When the Cook Islands and Niue became New Zealand territories in 1901, their {{inhabitants}} {{were already}} British subjects. In 1920, <b>Tokelauans</b> became recognised as British subjects.|$|R
25|$|Human {{rights were}} not {{mentioned}} in <b>Tokelauan</b> legislation until the Human Rights Rules 2004. These rules were very basic and are now what is incorporated in the Constitution of Tokelau 2007. Tokelau accepts {{the principles of the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|Tokelau ensures {{they are}} {{adhering}} to Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights {{in regards to}} access to healthcare by making all dental and medical services free {{to the citizens of}} Tokelau. This includes the prescription of essential medicines. Where a person is required to go to Samoa for healthcare the <b>Tokelauan</b> Government provides a subsidy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{hospitals}} in Tokelau, one {{is located on}} each of the three atolls. They are the primary healthcare facilities for <b>Tokelauan</b> residents. Each hospital has 12 beds, none of which have the capacity for intensive care patients. In the case of serious injuries patients have to be evacuated to Samoa and in some cases to New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Tokelau's {{claim to}} Swains is {{generally}} {{comparable to the}} Marshall Islands' claim to US-administered Wake Island, but the re-emergence of this somewhat dormant issue has been an unintended result of the United Nations' recent efforts to promote decolonisation in Tokelau. <b>Tokelauans</b> have proved somewhat reluctant to push their national identity in the political realm: recent decolonisation moves have mainly been driven from outside for ideological reasons. But at the same time, <b>Tokelauans</b> are reluctant to disown their common cultural identity with Swains Islanders who speak their language.|$|R
50|$|Middle aged {{people were}} found to have the best English writing skills, with 85.5% of <b>Tokelauans</b> aged between 30 and 49 years {{reporting}} 'good' or 'very good' English writing ability.|$|R
50|$|The {{referendum}} {{was open}} to <b>Tokelauans</b> aged 18 or older, with 789 people eligible to vote. A majority of two-thirds of voters was necessary for the referendum to be accepted.|$|R
25|$|Moana: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the soundtrack}} to the 2016 Disney {{animated}} film Moana. The soundtrack {{was released by}} Walt Disney Records on November 19, 2016. It features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i, with lyrics in English, Samoan, <b>Tokelauan,</b> and Tuvalu. The two-disc deluxe edition includes the score, which was composed by Mancina, as well as demos, outtakes and instrumental karaoke tracks.|$|E
25|$|Major {{criminal}} {{or civil}} matters, {{as well as}} appeals, {{can be dealt with}} by the High Court of New Zealand acting as the High Court of Tokelau, followed by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, acting as the Court of Appeal of Tokelau. In addition, despite having been abolished in other Commonwealth nations such as Australia and New Zealand, the right of appeal to the Privy Council still theoretically exists for <b>Tokelauan</b> disputes.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{acquiring}} citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau are treated as part of New Zealand – hence, for example, a child born in Tokelau to a <b>Tokelauan</b> permanent resident would qualify for New Zealand citizenship. However, for Samoan citizens applying for a special grant of New Zealand citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau are not treated as part of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 {{came into}} effect on 1 January 1949, Cook Islanders, Niueans, <b>Tokelauans</b> and Western Samoans who were British {{subjects}} gained New Zealand citizenship.|$|R
50|$|Smoking in Tokelau is prevalent, {{with ethnic}} <b>Tokelauans</b> having the highest smoking {{prevalence}} of all Pacific ethnicities. In the 2011 Tokelau Census, 47.8% of people aged over 15 {{were found to}} be regular cigarette smokers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{populations of}} Polynesians living on atolls near the equator provide an {{opportunity}} to investigate the relative effects ofsaturated fat and dietary cholesterol in determining serum cholesterol levels. The habitual diets of the atoll dwellers from both Pukapuka and Tokelau are high in saturated fat but low in dietary cholesterol and sucrose. Coconut is the chief source of energy for both groups. <b>Tokelauans</b> obtain a much higher percentage of energy from coconut than the Pukapukans, 63 % compared with 34 %, so their intake of saturated fat is higher. The serum cholesterol levels are 35 to 40 mg higher in <b>Tokelauans</b> than in Pukapukans. These major differences in serum cholesterol levels are considered to be due to the higher saturated fat intake of the <b>Tokelauans.</b> Analysis of a variety of food samples, and human fat biopsies show a high lauric (12 : 0) and myristic (14 : 0) content. Vascular disease is uncommon is both populations and {{there is no evidence of}} the high saturated fat intake having a harmful effect in these populations. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 34 : 1552 - 1561, 1981...|$|R
25|$|Nanumeans are Polynesians. The Nanumean dialect of the Tuvaluan {{language}} {{is closely related}} to other west Polynesian languages, including the Tongan language, <b>Tokelauan,</b> Samoan, and the languages of the Polynesian outliers. Although the eight Tuvalu communities have distinctive accents and some distinctive vocabulary, the dialects of Tuvalu are mutually intelligible to Tuvalu speakers {{with the exception of the}} language of Nui atoll, whose inhabitants speak a dialect of the Gilbertese language (with the exception of small children, most Tuvaluans from Nui also speak Tuvaluan). With this exception, Tuvaluan is universally understood and spoken in Tuvalu. English is also spoken, especially in Tuvalu's capital, and is one of the official languages of the central government.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Tokelauan</b> {{language}} is a tenseless language. The language uses the same words for all three tenses; the phrase E liliu mai au i te Aho Tōnai literally translates to Come back / me / on Saturday, but the translation becomes ‘I am coming back on Saturday’.] ...|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand {{conducted}} an educational review of Tokelau in February 2014, and found [...] "the {{overall quality of}} teaching does not enable all <b>Tokelauan</b> students to achieve the education standards outlined in the Tokelau National Curriculum Policy Framework". The same report went on to find {{that none of the}} schools were well resourced in facilities and teaching materials.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 62% of the South Island's Pacific Islander {{community}} {{reside in}} Christchurch {{and the surrounding}} Canterbury region, equalling approximately 11,500 people. People of Samoan descent comprise about half the Pacific Islander population. There are also smaller communities of Cook Islanders, Fijians, Niueans, <b>Tokelauans</b> and Tongans residing in the city.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>Tokelauans</b> reside in New Zealand, and were ineligible {{to vote in}} the referendum, in line with standard practice in United Nations mandated votes on self-determination. However concerns among this community may have influenced those who were eligible to vote, thereby contributing to the referendum's failure.|$|R
50|$|Missionaries preached Christianity in Tokelau from 1845 to the 1860s. French Catholic missionaries on Wallis Island (also {{known as}} 'Uvea) and missionaries of the Protestant London Missionary Society in Samoa used native {{teachers}} {{to convert the}} <b>Tokelauans.</b> Atafu was converted to Protestantism by the London Missionary Society, Nukunonu was converted to Catholicism and Fakaofo was converted to both denominations.|$|R
2500|$|For the soundtrack, Disney {{wanted to}} combine {{traditional}} South Pacific culture with pop and Broadway sensibilities, {{which led to}} the hiring of Broadway playwright, songwriter and composer Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer Mark Mancina and <b>Tokelauan</b> singer-songwriter Opetaia Foa'i. The first song they completed was [...] "We Know the Way", which Foa'i began after his first meeting with Disney in December 2013. The trio worked together in New Zealand and in Los Angeles. At the same time, Miranda was also developing and starring in the Broadway musical Hamilton, which meant he was able to recruit Hamilton stars Phillipa Soo, Christopher Jackson, and Renée Elise Goldsberry as well as In The Heights star Marcy Harriell to help him record demos of his songs.|$|E
50|$|The {{proportion}} of females in Tokelau with 'very good' English writing skills {{is greater than}} that of <b>Tokelauan</b> males. However the {{proportion of}} <b>Tokelauan</b> females that cannot write in English at all is also {{greater than that of}} <b>Tokelauan</b> males.|$|E
50|$|Just under 90% of Tokelauans, as of 2011, {{claim to}} have 'good' or 'very good' skills in <b>Tokelauan</b> writing. Only 1.4% of Tokelauans are unable to write in the <b>Tokelauan</b> language.|$|E
50|$|While {{slightly}} more females than males live on Atafu and Fakaofo, males make up 57% of Nukunonu residents. Only 9% of <b>Tokelauans</b> aged 40 or more {{have never been}} married. One-quarter of the population were born overseas; almost all the rest live on the same atoll they were born on. Most households own five or more pigs.|$|R
50|$|The Dominion of New Zealand, {{of which}} Tokelau {{formerly}} was a part, {{has since been}} superseded by the Realm of New Zealand, of which Tokelau remains a part. Defence {{is the responsibility of}} New Zealand. When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1 January 1949, <b>Tokelauans</b> who were British subjects gained New Zealand citizenship—a status they still hold.|$|R
5000|$|Swains Island ( [...] ; Samoan: Olosega) is an atoll in the Tokelau chain. Culturally {{a part of}} Tokelau, it is {{administered}} by the United States as part of American Samoa. Swains Island is also known as Olosenga Island or Olohega Island. Owned by the Jennings family and used as a copra plantation, Swains Island has a population of 17 <b>Tokelauans,</b> who harvest the island's coconuts. The land area is 1.5 km2.|$|R
50|$|As of 2011, {{less than}} 1% of Tokelauans {{are unable to}} read in the <b>Tokelauan</b> language, with little {{variation}} due to age. 90.4% of Tokelauans reported being 'good' or 'very good' at reading <b>Tokelauan.</b>|$|E
50|$|No {{significant}} distinction {{could be}} found between the gender balance of those that reported having 'very good' English reading skills, however illiteracy in English {{is more common in}} <b>Tokelauan</b> females than in <b>Tokelauan</b> males.|$|E
50|$|Tuvaluan is {{mutually}} intelligible with <b>Tokelauan,</b> {{spoken by}} the approximately 1,700 {{inhabitants of the}} three atolls of Tokelau and on Swains Island, {{as well as the}} several thousand <b>Tokelauan</b> migrants living in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Before this, {{the three}} atolls {{had only one}} {{computer}} each, and the internet connection was so slow that {{it could only be}} used for email, without attachments. According to Zuurbier, an internet connection that would cost $10 per month in the United States costs approximately $2000 per month to provide in Tokelau, and because Tokelau has a GDP (PPP) per capita of only $1035, most <b>Tokelauans</b> would be unable to afford an internet connection without outside assistance.|$|R
50|$|Missionaries preached Christianity in Tokelau from 1845 to the 1860s. French Roman Catholic missionaries on Wallis Island (also {{known as}} 'Uvea) and missionaries of the Protestant London Missionary Society in Samoa used native {{teachers}} {{to convert the}} <b>Tokelauans.</b> Atafu was converted to Protestantism by the London Missionary Society, Nukunonu was converted to Catholicism and Fakaofo was converted to both denominations. Since 1992 the Roman Catholic Mission Sui Iuris of Tokelau has represented the Catholic church in Tokelau.|$|R
50|$|Tokelau {{annually}} exports around US$100,000 (€67,000) of stamps, copra and woven {{and carved}} handicrafts and imports over US$300,000 (€202,000) of foodstuffs, building materials, and fuel to, and from, New Zealand. New Zealand also pays directly {{for the cost}} of medical and education services. Local industries include small-scale enterprises for copra production, wood work, plaited craft goods, stamps, coins, and fishing. Agriculture and livestock produces coconuts, copra, breadfruit, papayas, bananas, figs, pigs, poultry and a few goats. Many <b>Tokelauans</b> live in New Zealand and support their families in Tokelau through remittances.|$|R
