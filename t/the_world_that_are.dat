5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA {{study found that the}} Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E

25|$|Unger’s aim is twofold. First, {{to level}} a critique, expansion, and defense of modern {{thinking}} about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since Hume and Kant has leveled against it.” And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls the passions—our raw responses to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> ambivalent towards reasons but also act {{in the service of}} reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.|$|E
500|$|Paloma Josse, an {{advanced}} {{soon to be}} thirteen-year-old, belongs {{to one of the}} conventional families living in the posh apartment building where Renée works. Daughter of an important parliamentarian father (a former government minister), and a Flaubert-quoting mother, Paloma has a penchant for absurdism. She regards her sister's scholarship as [...] "cold and trivial" [...] and deems her mother's culture as conventional and useless. Paloma herself values Japanese works, and reads manga, haiku, and tanka. She keeps two diaries, one called [...] "Journal of the Movement of the World" [...] to record her observations of the world around her, and the other called [...] "Profound Thoughts" [...] to record her many and wide-ranging reflections on art, poetry, people and herself. She is introspective, and truly kind, though she tries her best to avoid the inquisition of others. She understands many facets of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unseen by others, and deeply [...] understand the way the world works, and the many perils and pitfalls of adulthood and the many hypocrisies of modern society, and therefore resolves in not an all melodramatic way, to commit suicide. However, a drastic plot twist {{at the end of the}} tale opens to her an amazing new truth: beauty, that provides meaning to our lives.|$|E
