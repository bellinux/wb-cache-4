Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E
50|$|The writ {{was divided}} into cape magnum, or the grand cape, and cape parvum, or the petit cape. While they were alike in their effect, as to taking hold of {{immovable}} things, they differed in the following circumstances: first, in that the cape magnum lay before, and the cape parvum after; second, cape magnum summoned <b>the</b> defendant <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> default, in addition <b>to</b> <b>answering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff, while cape parvum only summoned <b>the</b> defendant <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> default.

Hugh Nonant wrote that Longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute, which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore. Longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving England, on 29October.|$|E

On third down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, forcing another punt. The kick rolled out of bounds at the Tech 17-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began another drive.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|Before a {{decision}} was made to establish a harbour (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted of only a few farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing and shipping activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors have arrived by ferry from Harwich, Essex, England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The harbour facilities are being expanded <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> needs of the wind-turbine industry and container shipping traffic. Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Each attempt <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers {{argue that}} this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings.
