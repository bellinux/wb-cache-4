5|$|Despite {{commercial}} traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was maintained in good order, and <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> {{was used for}} the transport of potable water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for Somerset County Council to start the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> was reopened throughout.

The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E

5|$|The Newport Pagnell Canal {{had opened}} in 1817 between the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell. <b>The</b> <b>canal</b> carried a {{reasonable}} level of traffic, but in 1845, the LNWR attempted to buy <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> {{using it for}} a potential railway line.

5|$|The {{building}} of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which opened in 1827, directly affected the River Tone Navigation, as it provided a more direct route between Taunton and Bridgwater.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>canal</b> was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858, when Richard Dunston {{moved his}} yard to Thorne from Torksey, and 1984 when the yard closed. Dunston's company were pioneers {{in the use}} of welded {{construction}} and innovative tug propulsion systems. The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than the lock could pass through when the river was level with <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> company feared that it might get stuck in the lock, resulting in flooding and draining of <b>the</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>canal</b> was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament {{passed on}} 6 June 1791, which created The Company and Proprietors of the Neath Canal Navigation, who had powers to raise £25,000 by {{the issue of}} shares, and an additional £10,000 if necessary. As well as building <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canal</b> Company could build inclined planes, railways or rollers if required, and could optionally use {{the bed of the}} River Neath. <b>The</b> <b>canal</b> was to run from Glynneath (called Abernant at the time), which was not as far up the valley as Pontneddfechan, to Melincryddan Pill at Neath, where it would join the river. Thomas Dadford was employed as Engineer, and construction started from Neath, northwards towards Glynneath. <b>The</b> <b>canal</b> had reached the River Neath at Ynysbwllog by 1792, when Dadford resigned to take up work on the Monmouthshire Canal. He was replaced by Thomas Sheasby, who failed to complete <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> by the November 1793 deadline given to him, and was arrested in 1794 for irregularities in the accounts of the Glamorganshire Canal. <b>The</b> <b>canal</b> company completed the building work by 1795, using direct labour, although the lock into the river was never built. Rebuilding of locks and other improvements continued to be made for several years afterwards.|$|E

Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge tramroad worked by horses from his Gin Pit Colliery to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf.
