5|$|<b>The</b> <b>demands</b> of {{free speech}} in a {{democratic}} society as well as the interest in national security are better served by candid and informed weighing of the competing interests, {{within the confines of the}} judicial process.|$|E
50|$|Increases in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for labour {{will move}} the economy along <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve, {{increasing}} wages and employment. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> for labour {{in an economy}} is derived from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> {{for goods and services}}. As such, if <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for goods and services in the economy increases, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} farm {{production}} and <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for fertilizer. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> for farm crops leads to <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for fertilizer {{with which to}} grow them.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> for inputs is a derived <b>demand.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> is {{determined}} by or originates from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for <b>the</b> product the inputs are used to produce.|$|R

5|$|By early May, the Albanian authorities, {{being unable}} to {{suppress}} the revolt, became willing to start discussions with {{the intervention of the}} International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that they were willing to discuss <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the Northern Epirote side.|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 c shows <b>the</b> total <b>demand</b> {{utility of}} {{customers}} with DRL =  0 and with DRL =  1.88 %. When the units’ output can meet <b>the</b> original <b>demand</b> of customers, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> utility of customers is at a maximum. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> utility of customers {{is reduced by}} <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curtailment of customers participating in DR.|$|R
2500|$|Like with supply curves, economists {{distinguish}} between <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve {{of an individual}} and <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> curve. [...] <b>The</b> market <b>demand</b> curve is obtained by summing <b>the</b> quantities <b>demanded</b> by all consumers at each potential price. [...] Thus, in the graph of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve, individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> curve.|$|R
40|$|The {{cooperative}} solution concept introduced here, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set, {{contains the}} core and {{is included in the}} Zhou bargaining set, eliminating the “dominated ” coalition structures. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> vectors belonging to <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set are self-stable. In the class of constant-sum homogeneous weighted majority games <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set is non-empty and predicts a unique demand vector, namely a proportional distribution within minimal winning coalitions. The noncooperative implementation of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> bargaining set is obtained for all the games that satisfy the one-stage property...|$|R
5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> for {{charcoal}} {{used in the}} blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, rebels from Kent and Essex {{marched to}} London and, once {{admitted}} to the city, managed to capture the Tower of London. King Richard, who had promised to agree to all <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the peasants, met the rebels outside the city, where {{the leader of the}} peasants Wat Tyler was killed and the rebellion was ended. The king's promises were retracted.|$|E
5|$|George Pullman and William Halliday {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} their industrial operations, giving {{attention to the}} minutest details. Their labor forces, tempered by <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of industry in America, expected to work hard {{in exchange for the}} necessities of life. Cooperation between managers and workers created a higher standard of living, which in turn, encouraged better working conditions.Good housing also helped promote good work habits.|$|E
50|$|To compute <b>the</b> inverse <b>demand</b> {{function}}, simply {{solve for}} P from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> function. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> function has <b>the</b> form Q = 240 - 2P then <b>the</b> inverse <b>demand</b> function would be P = 120 - 0.5Q.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for energy drinks. The {{aim of this}} paper is to examine the {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical part will deal with the explanation of the terms and describe the basic factors that determine <b>the</b> <b>demand.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical part will also include the marketing mix, which is a function of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> and <b>the</b> practical part of this work. In the practical part I will try to analyze current demand for energy drinks by means of a questionnaire...|$|R

5|$|Hull City and Grimsby Town {{were the}} only two {{professional}} teams which had official permission to play league football on Christmas Day because of <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the fish trade, but that tradition has now disappeared following the dramatic reduction of their trawler fleets in recent years.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just {{before he left the}} Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Cattle trails and cattle ranches {{developed}} as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory. In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> curve {{facing a}} {{particular}} firm is called <b>the</b> residual <b>demand</b> curve. <b>The</b> residual <b>demand</b> curve is <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> {{that is not}} met by other firms in the industry at a given price. <b>The</b> residual <b>demand</b> curve is <b>the</b> market <b>demand</b> curve D(p), minus the supply of other organizations, So(p):Dr(p) = D(p) - So(p [...] ) ...|$|R
30|$|We {{can find}} that <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> D(t) has a {{significant}} impact on the manufacturer’s optimal total cost per unit time TC since the term a in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> D(t) has a greater impact than the term b in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> in both <b>the</b> cases.|$|R

The breed is considered average size and they have a thick coat, due to the climate of their native Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi {{began at}} Ely Cathedral, the {{location}} used for Westminster Abbey. The production {{had asked for}} permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of tourism. Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.|$|E

5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed to cope with <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the O Street Market {{was delayed}} {{for two years}} as the {{developers}} sought to meet <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board.
