5|$|Modifications {{were made}} to the circuit from Mulsanne Corner to the Corvette Curves. The circuit was widened on the road {{connecting}} Mulsanne to Indianapolis, and again from Indianapolis to <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves, although the kerbs remained in their previous locations. The first corner of <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves had a larger run-off area on the outside while SAFER barriers had been installed on the inside wall. The Corvette corner also now featured a gravel run-off.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{reached the}} quarterfinals at <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, {{where she was}} {{defeated}} by eventual finalist Ivanović. In the following competition, the 7th-seed Russian was finalist at the Portugal Open, losing to Carla Suárez Navarro in tough three sets. This was her first single final {{in more than three}} years.|$|E
50|$|This race saw the {{competition}} debut of <b>the</b> new <b>Porsche</b> RS Spyder, <b>the</b> first <b>Porsche</b> prototype in approximately seven years.|$|R
50|$|He won <b>the</b> 1992 <b>Porsche</b> Carrera Cup Deutschland, <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Porsche</b> Supercup and <b>the</b> 1995 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft {{privateer}} B-Class championship.|$|R
50|$|Velazquez left Honda in 1999 to {{work for}} Porsche AG at a newly {{designed}} facility in Weissach, Germany to work on <b>Porsche’s</b> first SUV, <b>the</b> 2002 <b>Porsche</b> Cayenne (new model introduction). Velazquez went on {{to work on the}} designs of <b>the</b> 2003 <b>Porsche</b> 911 (major model change) and <b>the</b> 2004 <b>Porsche</b> Boxster (minor model redesign).|$|R
5|$|The RS Spyder {{made its}} race debut {{at the final}} round of the 2005 American Le Mans Series, the Monterey Sports Car Championship at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, entered by Penske Racing and driven by Lucas Luhr and Sascha Maassen from <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Junioren factory team.

5|$|A third safety car {{period was}} caused by the Creation Autosportif entry, which ran into the tire {{barriers}} at <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves and needed to be extracted. The Creation returned to the pits but eventually retired. The Kruse Motorsport entry also suffered problems when it briefly stopped at the pit entrance during the caution period, blocking other cars attempting to make their own pit stops. The Kruse entry eventually succeeded in getting to its garage.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, Kuznetsova {{recorded}} {{her first}} career win over Serena Williams before losing {{in the semifinals}} to Tatiana Golovin. The following week she was seeded 1st in the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, but lost to Serena Williams in the semifinals. Kuznetsova completed the year by competing at the year-ending Championships in Madrid, but once again failed to progress beyond the preliminary round-robin stage, losing all three matches. She finished the season as world No. 2 and as the highest-ranked Russian player for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|Karl Rabe (29 October 1895, Pottendorf, Austria - 28 October 1968) was an {{automobile}} designer {{and was the}} Chief Designer at Porsche. [...] He helped Ferdinand <b>Porsche</b> to develop <b>the</b> <b>Porsche's</b> transmissions.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{touring car}} racing, Asch was also busy in Porsche series. He won <b>the</b> German <b>Porsche</b> 944 Turbo Cup twice, in 1988 and 1989, before winning <b>the</b> German <b>Porsche</b> Carrera Cup in 1991.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2012 <b>Porsche</b> Mobil 1 Supercup {{season was}} <b>the</b> 20th <b>Porsche</b> Supercup season. It began on 21 April on Bahrain International Circuit and {{finished}} on 9 September at Autodromo Nazionale Monza, after ten scheduled races.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Porsche</b> hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. <b>The</b> <b>Porsche</b> suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
5|$|The public roads {{from the}} Indianapolis corner to <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves were re-surfaced. Run-off areas at the Dunlop Chicane, Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, and Ford Chicanes were also {{partially}} asphalted {{in order to}} avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which had gone off course. This also increased safety by allowing the cars to slow themselves more efficiently using their brakes and tyres on tarmac.|$|E
5|$|Volkswagen Group {{took over}} and {{expanded}} the BAZ communist-built factory in 1991, and has since considerably expanded production beyond original Skoda Auto models. Currently, 68% of production is focused on SUVs: Audi Q7; VW Touareg; {{as well as the}} body and under-chassis of <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Cayenne.

5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on the No. 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an oil pressure sensor failure and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change brake discs {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in the No. 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned in the gravel at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back to the garage for repairs to its front-left corner. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning the No. 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hours of}} {{practice}} were {{held for the}} field on Wednesday afternoon, but again suffered from variable wet conditions throughout. The No. 17 Porsche once again led the session although Webber was the fastest driver to set the three minutes and 21.362 seconds lap time. Audi closed to within half a second with Loïc Duval's three minutes and 21.950 seconds lap. The LMP2 category had only a single car manage a lap under three minutes and 40 seconds when Richard Bradley set a three minutes and 39.897 seconds lap, a full second ahead of the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. The KCMG car had earlier caused the session to be red flagged when the car {{came to a stop}} at the first Mulsanne Straight chicane. The Murphy Prototypes Oreca-Nissan later caused a second stoppage when Mark Patterson spun in <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves entry and heavily impacted the safety barrier. Patterson was unhurt. The LMGTE Pro category was again led by Aston Martin, Richie Stanaway's No. 99 car setting a three minutes and 55.895 seconds lap, followed by the No. 64 Corvette and the No. 97 Aston Martin. Mathias Lauda kept the No. 98 Aston Martin ahead in LMGTE Am, nearly two seconds ahead of the two Proton Porsche cars.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in <b>the</b> <b>Porsche</b> Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Roock Racing <b>Porsche</b> easily won <b>the</b> GT2 class {{finishing}} 12th {{overall and}} four laps ahead of <b>the</b> PARR Motorsport <b>Porsche.</b> <b>The</b> Kiwi <b>Porsche</b> had a trouble-free race, spending the least {{time in the}} pits of any car except for the winning TWR-Porsche. The Japanese GTs were uncompetitive against the Porsches and McLarens, and those that did finish were well down the board.The Kudzu-Mazda was the only LMP2 finisher, coming in {{at the back of}} the field nearly 100 laps behind the winners.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 4-Cam <b>Porsche</b> engine (#90059), {{along with}} the {{original}} California Owner's Registration (aka CA Pink Slip) listing the engine number, {{is still in the}} possession of the family of the late Dr. Eschrich. <b>The</b> <b>Porsche's</b> transaxle assembly (#10046), is currently owned by Porsche collector and restorer Jack Styles in Massachusetts.
