5|$|Tyrion Lannister converses with Varys, Missandei, and Grey Worm, and {{learns that}} Astapor and Yunkai have been retaken by the Masters, leaving Meereen the only free city in Slaver's Bay. Knowing that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> {{power of the}} dragons, Tyrion heads to the dungeons to free them. While wary at first, the dragons do not attack Tyrion and allow him to undo their {{shackles}} before retreating deeper into the dungeon.|$|E
5|$|At Somnia, {{the hero}} meets Carver, which doesn't seem to {{remember}} the hero. The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's military which gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower. The hero manages to find this item successfully and formally becomes a soldier of Somnia. After a task which the Hero and Carver work together to get a horse for an old man, Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia and himself and the hero are given permission {{to talk to the}} king where they learn to defeat Murdaw, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they can not be seen. Milly, also appearing to have lost her memory, does see them and helps them become visible via Madame Luca's help.|$|E
60|$|While Jim was handing round {{drinks and}} sandwiches, and Josephine was making tea, Robert played Bach on the piano--the pianola, rather. The chairs and lounge {{were in a}} half-circle round the fire. The party threw off their wraps and sank deep into this {{expensive}} comfort of modern bohemia. <b>They</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> Bach {{to take away the}} bad taste that Aida had left in their mouths. <b>They</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> whiskey and curacao to rouse their spirits. <b>They</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> profound comfort in which to sink away from the world. All the men, except Aaron, had been through the war in some way or other. But here they were, in the old setting exactly, the old bohemian routine.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, one scientist, Sean Senechal, has been developing, studying, {{and using the}} learned visible, {{expressive}} language in dogs and horses.

25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> <b>The</b> phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because it is harder to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it is even more important for companies to allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E
25|$|Zelena and Arthur are in {{the woods}} and come upon the witch’s home and is met by a giant wolf, only to have Zelena throws some {{sleeping}} powder on it to make it sleepy. The witch appears and says she won’t be as easy to subdue. Arthur asks for the magic helm and the witch says she already sent someone to look for it. Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then show up with Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> helm to protect their people but they don’t have it. Zelena takes Merida's bow to use as a tracking device, and tells her she can console herself with the memories of what a terrible ruler {{he turned out to be}} then tells Arthur they can use it to track the helm and they disappear.|$|E

500|$|According to Kalinske, Sega of America [...] "fought {{against the}} {{architecture}} of Saturn for quite some time". Seeking an alternative graphics chip for the Saturn, Kalinske attempted to broker a deal with Silicon Graphics, but Sega of Japan rejected the proposal. Silicon Graphics subsequently collaborated with Nintendo on the Nintendo 64. Kalinske, Sony Electronic Publishing's Olaf Olafsson, and Sony America's Micky Schulhof had previously discussed development of a joint [...] "Sega/Sony hardware system", which never came to fruition due to Sega's desire to create hardware that could accommodate both 2D and 3D visuals and Sony's competing notion of focusing entirely on 3D technology. Publicly, Kalinske defended the Saturn's design: [...] "Our people feel that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> multiprocessing {{to be able to}} bring to the home what we're doing next year in the arcades." ...|$|E

One by one, Joe defeats the members of the Jadow, the game's bosses. These include Dark Fiend Charles the 3rd, Iron Ogre Hulk Davidson, Aquatic Terror Gran Bruce, a doppelgänger of Viewtiful Joe, and Blade Master Alastor. Before fighting Alastor, he reveals that in order for the Jadow to break out of Movieland and into the land of humans, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> [...] "DNA of the Creator", namely Silvia. Joe makes his way to her, trumping the Jadow's leader Inferno Lord Fire Leo in combat, only to witness Silvia being kidnapped once again afterwards. Joe and Six Machine race off into outer space after her in the game's final episode.|$|E

2500|$|In {{areas where}} the rising of land is seen, it is {{necessary}} to define the exact limits of property.
