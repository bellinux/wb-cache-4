ANOVA confirms the adequacy of <b>the</b> <b>quadratic</b> <b>model</b> [30, 32]. ANOVA divides the sum of squares of each of the two sources of variation, the model and the experimental error, showing whether the variation from the model is significant or not when compared with the ones associated with residual error [30, 31, 33]. This comparison is performed by degrees of freedom (F value). If the model predicts the experimental results well, the F value should be greater than the tabulated value of F distribution for a certain number of degrees of freedom in the model at a level of significance α. The F value obtained, 12.82, is clearly greater than the tabulated F (2.352 at 95 % significance), confirming the adequacy of the model fits.|$|R
40|$|Making use of {{long-term}} transverse vibration monitoring data of DaShengGuan Bridge, the early-warning method of train running {{safety of the}} high-speed railway bridge is established by adopting principal component analysis (PCA) method.

The correlation model between the RMS values measured from different positions is further adopted as the evaluating model for the train running safety. Finally, {{the effects of the}} environmental changes on the evaluating model are eliminated using the PCA method and the warning index for the train running safety is further constructed. The analysis results show that the correlation between the RMS values of the accelerations from different measuring positions on the main girder can be analyzed by a <b>quadratic</b> polynomial <b>fitting</b> <b>model.</b> <b>The</b> PCA method can effectively remove the environmental effects on <b>the</b> <b>quadratic</b> polynomial <b>fitting</b> <b>model.</b> <b>The</b> proposed warning method provides a good capability for detecting the abnormal changes of the measured transverse accelerations and hence it is suitable for early-warning of the train running safety...|$|R

This model adopts a non-linear extension of the stress-strain relationship that allows it to capture the anisotropy of flow conditions.
